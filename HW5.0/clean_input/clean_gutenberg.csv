alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister on the bank and of having nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought alice without pictures or conversations ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did alice think it so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear i shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of its waistcoatpocket and looked at it and then hurried on alice started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbithole under the hedge ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that alice had not a moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself falling down a very deep well ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to wonder what was going to happen next first she tried to look down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs she took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was labelled orange marmalade but to her great disappointment it was empty she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing somebody underneath so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she fell past it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
well thought alice to herself after such a fall as this i shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs how brave theyll all think me at home why i wouldnt say anything about it even if i fell off the top of the house which was very likely true ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
down down down would the fall never come to an end i wonder how many miles ive fallen by this time she said aloud i must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth let me see that would be four thousand miles down i think for you see alice had learnt several things of this sort in her lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a very good opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes thats about the right distancebut then i wonder what latitude or longitude ive got to alice had no idea what latitude was or longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to say ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
presently she began again i wonder if i shall fall right through the earth how funny itll seem to come out among the people that walk with their heads downward the antipathies i think she was rather glad there was no one listening this time as it didnt sound at all the right word but i shall have to ask them what the name of the country is you know please maam is this new zealand or australia and she tried to curtsey as she spokefancy curtseying as youre falling through the air do you think you could manage it and what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking no itll never do to ask perhaps i shall see it written up somewhere ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
down down down there was nothing else to do so alice soon began talking again dinahll miss me very much tonight i should think dinah was the cat i hope theyll remember her saucer of milk at teatime dinah my dear i wish you were down here with me there are no mice in the air im afraid but you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know but do cats eat bats i wonder and here alice began to get rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of way do cats eat bats do cats eat bats and sometimes do bats eat cats for you see as she couldnt answer either question it didnt much matter which way she put it she felt that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she was walking hand in hand with dinah and saying to her very earnestly now dinah tell me the truth did you ever eat a bat when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a moment she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her was another long passage and the white rabbit was still in sight hurrying down it there was not a moment to be lost away went alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it say as it turned a corner oh my ears and whiskers how late its getting she was close behind it when she turned the corner but the rabbit was no longer to be seen she found herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps hanging from the roof ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
there were doors all round the hall but they were all locked and when alice had been all the way down one side and up the other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle wondering how she was ever to get out again ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key and alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of them however on the second time round she came upon a low curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little door about fifteen inches high she tried the little golden key in the lock and to her great delight it fitted ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice opened the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rathole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through thought poor alice it would be of very little use without my shoulders oh how i wish i could shut up like a telescope i think i could if i only knew how to begin for you see so many outoftheway things had happened lately that alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it was all very well to say drink me but the wise little alice was not going to do that in a hurry no ill look first she said and see whether its marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a redhot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
however this bottle was not marked poison so alice ventured to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished it off ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
and so it was indeed she was now only ten inches high and her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right size for going through the little door into that lovely garden first however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was going to shrink any further she felt a little nervous about this for it might end you know said alice to herself in my going out altogether like a candle i wonder what i should be like then and she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember ever having seen such a thing ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
after a while finding that nothing more happened she decided on going into the garden at once but alas for poor alice when she got to the door she found she had forgotten the little golden key and when she went back to the table for it she found she could not possibly reach it she could see it quite plainly through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and cried ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
come theres no use in crying like that said alice to herself rather sharply i advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people but its no use now thought poor alice to pretend to be two people why theres hardly enough of me left to make one respectable person ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under the table she opened it and found in it a very small cake on which the words eat me were beautifully marked in currants well ill eat it said alice and if it makes me grow larger i can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller i can creep under the door so either way ill get into the garden and i dont care which happens ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself which way which way holding her hand on the top of her head to feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to find that she remained the same size to be sure this generally happens when one eats cake but alice had got so much into the way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the common way ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
curiouser and curiouser cried alice she was so much surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good english now im opening out like the largest telescope that ever was goodbye feet for when she looked down at her feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so far off oh my poor little feet i wonder who will put on your shoes and stockings for you now dears im sure i shant be able i shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself about you you must manage the best way you canbut i must be kind to them thought alice or perhaps they wont walk the way i want to go let me see ill give them a new pair of boots every christmas ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you ought to be ashamed of yourself said alice a great girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in this way stop this moment i tell you but she went on all the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the hall ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
after a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming it was the white rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the other he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to himself as he came oh the duchess the duchess oh wont she be savage if ive kept her waiting alice felt so desperate that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the rabbit came near her she began in a low timid voice if you please sir the rabbit started violently dropped the white kid gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard as he could go ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking dear dear how queer everything is today and yesterday things went on just as usual i wonder if ive been changed in the night let me think was i the same when i got up this morning i almost think i can remember feeling a little different but if im not the same the next question is who in the world am i ah thats the great puzzle and she began thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of them ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
im sure im not ada she said for her hair goes in such long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and im sure i cant be mabel for i know all sorts of things and she oh she knows such a very little besides shes she and im i andoh dear how puzzling it all is ill try if i know all the things i used to know let me see four times five is twelve and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear i shall never get to twenty at that rate however the multiplication table doesnt signify lets try geography london is the capital of paris and paris is the capital of rome and romeno thats all wrong im certain i must have been changed for mabel ill try and say how doth the little and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
how doth the little crocodile improve his shining tail and pour the waters of the nile on every golden scale ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
how cheerfully he seems to grin how neatly spread his claws and welcome little fishes in with gently smiling jaws ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
im sure those are not the right words said poor alice and her eyes filled with tears again as she went on i must be mabel after all and i shall have to go and live in that poky little house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so many lessons to learn no ive made up my mind about it if im mabel ill stay down here itll be no use their putting their heads down and saying come up again dear i shall only look up and say who am i then tell me that first and then if i like being that person ill come up if not ill stay down here till im somebody elsebut oh dear cried alice with a sudden burst of tears i do wish they would put their heads down i am so very tired of being all alone here ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
as she said this she looked down at her hands and was surprised to see that she had put on one of the rabbits little white kid gloves while she was talking how can i have done that she thought i must be growing small again she got up and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high and was going on shrinking rapidly she soon found out that the cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
that was a narrow escape said alice a good deal frightened at the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed back to the little door but alas the little door was shut again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child for i never was so small as this before never and i declare its too bad that it is ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
as she said these words her foot slipped and in another moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water her first idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that case i can go back by railway she said to herself alice had been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general conclusion that wherever you go to on the english coast you find a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and behind them a railway station however she soon made out that she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine feet high ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i wish i hadnt cried so much said alice as she swam about trying to find her way out i shall be punished for it now i suppose by being drowned in my own tears that will be a queer thing to be sure however everything is queer today ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was at first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
would it be of any use now thought alice to speak to this mouse everything is so outoftheway down here that i should think very likely it can talk at any rate theres no harm in trying so she began o mouse do you know the way out of this pool i am very tired of swimming about here o mouse alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having seen in her brothers latin grammar a mouseof a mouseto a mousea mouseo mouse the mouse looked at her rather inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little eyes but it said nothing ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
perhaps it doesnt understand english thought alice i daresay its a french mouse come over with william the conqueror for with all her knowledge of history alice had no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened so she began again o est ma chatte which was the first sentence in her french lessonbook the mouse gave a sudden leap out of the water and seemed to quiver all over with fright oh i beg your pardon cried alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the poor animals feelings i quite forgot you didnt like cats ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
well perhaps not said alice in a soothing tone dont be angry about it and yet i wish i could show you our cat dinah i think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her she is such a dear quiet thing alice went on half to herself as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital one for catching miceoh i beg your pardon cried alice again for this time the mouse was bristling all over and she felt certain it must be really offended we wont talk about her any more if youd rather not ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
we indeed cried the mouse who was trembling down to the end of his tail as if i would talk on such a subject our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things dont let me hear the name again ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i wont indeed said alice in a great hurry to change the subject of conversation are youare you fondofof dogs the mouse did not answer so alice went on eagerly there is such a nice little dog near our house i should like to show you a little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly brown hair and itll fetch things when you throw them and itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsi cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds he says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried alice in a sorrowful tone im afraid ive offended it again for the mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and making quite a commotion in the pool as it went ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
so she called softly after it mouse dear do come back again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont like them when the mouse heard this it turned round and swam slowly back to her its face was quite pale with passion alice thought and it said in a low trembling voice let us get to the shore and then ill tell you my history and youll understand why it is i hate cats and dogs ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded with the birds and animals that had fallen into it there were a duck and a dodo a lory and an eaglet and several other curious creatures alice led the way and the whole party swam to the shore ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the first question of course was how to get dry again they had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed quite natural to alice to find herself talking familiarly with them as if she had known them all her life indeed she had quite a long argument with the lory who at last turned sulky and would only say i am older than you and must know better and this alice would not allow without knowing how old it was and as the lory positively refused to tell its age there was no more to be said ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
at last the mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among them called out sit down all of you and listen to me ill soon make you dry enough they all sat down at once in a large ring with the mouse in the middle alice kept her eyes anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad cold if she did not get dry very soon ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
ahem said the mouse with an important air are you all ready this is the driest thing i know silence all round if you please william the conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was soon submitted to by the english who wanted leaders and had been of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest edwin and morcar the earls of mercia and northumbria ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on found it advisable to go with edgar atheling to meet william and offer him the crown williams conduct at first was moderate but the insolence of his normans how are you getting on now my dear it continued turning to alice as it spoke ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
speak english said the eaglet i dont know the meaning of half those long words and whats more i dont believe you do either and the eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile some of the other birds tittered audibly ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
first it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party were placed along the course here and there there was no one two three and away but they began running when they liked and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know when the race was over however when they had been running half an hour or so and were quite dry again the dodo suddenly called out the race is over and they all crowded round it panting and asking but who has won ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
this question the dodo could not answer without a great deal of thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon its forehead the position in which you usually see shakespeare in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence at last the dodo said everybody has won and all must have prizes ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes there was exactly one apiece all round ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
then they all crowded round her once more while the dodo solemnly presented the thimble saying we beg your acceptance of this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short speech they all cheered ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble looking as solemn as she could ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the next thing was to eat the comfits this caused some noise and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on the back however it was over at last and they sat down again in a ring and begged the mouse to tell them something more ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it is a long tail certainly said alice looking down with wonder at the mouses tail but why do you call it sad and she kept on puzzling about it while the mouse was speaking so that her idea of the tale was something like this ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
fury said to a mouse that he met in the house let us both go to law i will prosecute youcome ill take no denial we must have a trial for really this morning ive nothing to do said the mouse to the cur such a trial dear sir with no jury or judge would be wasting our breath ill be judge ill be jury said cunning old fury ill try the whole cause and condemn you to death ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
what a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the lory as soon as it was quite out of sight and an old crab took the opportunity of saying to her daughter ah my dear let this be a lesson to you never to lose your temper hold your tongue ma said the young crab a little snappishly youre enough to try the patience of an oyster ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about her pet dinahs our cat and shes such a capital one for catching mice you cant think and oh i wish you could see her after the birds why shell eat a little bird as soon as look at it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
this speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party some of the birds hurried off at once one old magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking i really must be getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat and a canary called out in a trembling voice to its children come away my dears its high time you were all in bed on various pretexts they all moved off and alice was soon left alone ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i wish i hadnt mentioned dinah she said to herself in a melancholy tone nobody seems to like her down here and im sure shes the best cat in the world oh my dear dinah i wonder if i shall ever see you any more and here poor alice began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited in a little while however she again heard a little pattering of footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping that the mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to finish his story ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it was the white rabbit trotting slowly back again and looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something and she heard it muttering to itself the duchess the duchess oh my dear paws oh my fur and whiskers shell get me executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets where can i have dropped them i wonder alice guessed in a moment that it was looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and the little door had vanished completely ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
very soon the rabbit noticed alice as she went hunting about and called out to her in an angry tone why mary ann what are you doing out here run home this moment and fetch me a pair of gloves and a fan quick now and alice was so much frightened that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without trying to explain the mistake it had made ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
he took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran how surprised hell be when he finds out who i am but id better take him his fan and glovesthat is if i can find them as she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door of which was a bright brass plate with the name w rabbit engraved upon it she went in without knocking and hurried upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real mary ann and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and gloves ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
how queer it seems alice said to herself to be going messages for a rabbit i suppose dinahll be sending me on messages next and she began fancying the sort of thing that would happen miss alice come here directly and get ready for your walk coming in a minute nurse but ive got to see that the mouse doesnt get out only i dont think alice went on that theyd let dinah stop in the house if it began ordering people about like that ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
by this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves she took up the fan and a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the lookingglass there was no label this time with the words drink me but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips i know something interesting is sure to happen she said to herself whenever i eat or drink anything so ill just see what this bottle does i do hope itll make me grow large again for really im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being broken she hastily put down the bottle saying to herself thats quite enoughi hope i shant grow any moreas it is i cant get out at the doori do wish i hadnt drunk quite so much ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alas it was too late to wish that she went on growing and growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor in another minute there was not even room for this and she tried the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the other arm curled round her head still she went on growing and as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one foot up the chimney and said to herself now i can do no more whatever happens what will become of me ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
luckily for alice the little magic bottle had now had its full effect and she grew no larger still it was very uncomfortable and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it was much pleasanter at home thought poor alice when one wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about by mice and rabbits i almost wish i hadnt gone down that rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know this sort of life i do wonder what can have happened to me when i used to read fairytales i fancied that kind of thing never happened and now here i am in the middle of one there ought to be a book written about me that there ought and when i grow up ill write onebut im grown up now she added in a sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more here ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
mary ann mary ann said the voice fetch me my gloves this moment then came a little pattering of feet on the stairs alice knew it was the rabbit coming to look for her and she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she was now about a thousand times as large as the rabbit and had no reason to be afraid of it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
presently the rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it but as the door opened inwards and alices elbow was pressed hard against it that attempt proved a failure alice heard it say to itself then ill go round and get in at the window ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
that you wont thought alice and after waiting till she fancied she heard the rabbit just under the window she suddenly spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air she did not get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something of the sort ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
there was a long silence after this and alice could only hear whispers now and then such as sure i dont like it yer honour at all at all do as i tell you you coward and at last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in the air this time there were two little shrieks and more sounds of broken glass what a number of cucumberframes there must be thought alice i wonder what theyll do next as for pulling me out of the window i only wish they could im sure i dont want to stay in here any longer ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she waited for some time without hearing anything more at last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a good many voices all talking together she made out the words wheres the other ladderwhy i hadnt to bring but one bills got the otherbill fetch it here ladhere put em up at this cornerno tie em together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetoh theyll do well enough dont be particularhere bill catch hold of this ropewill the roof bearmind that loose slateoh its coming down heads below a loud crashnow who did thatit was bill i fancywhos to go down the chimneynay i shant you do itthat i wont thenbills to go downhere bill the master says youre to go down the chimney ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
oh so bills got to come down the chimney has he said alice to herself shy they seem to put everything upon bill i wouldnt be in bills place for a good deal this fireplace is narrow to be sure but i think i can kick a little ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close above her then saying to herself this is bill she gave one sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the first thing she heard was a general chorus of there goes bill then the rabbits voice alongcatch him you by the hedge then silence and then another confusion of voiceshold up his headbrandy nowdont choke himhow was it old fellow what happened to you tell us all about it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
last came a little feeble squeaking voice thats bill thought alice well i hardly knowno more thank ye im better nowbut im a deal too flustered to tell youall i know is something comes at me like a jackinthebox and up i goes like a skyrocket ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
there was a dead silence instantly and alice thought to herself i wonder what they will do next if they had any sense theyd take the roof off after a minute or two they began moving about again and alice heard the rabbit say a barrowful will do to begin with ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
a barrowful of what thought alice but she had not long to doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright idea came into her head if i eat one of these cakes she thought its sure to make some change in my size and as it cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller i suppose ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
so she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find that she began shrinking directly as soon as she was small enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside the poor little lizard bill was in the middle being held up by two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle they all made a rush at alice the moment she appeared but she ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a thick wood ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the first thing ive got to do said alice to herself as she wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden i think that will be the best plan ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over her head made her look up in a great hurry ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
an enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her poor little thing said alice in a coaxing tone and she tried hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then alice dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in its hurry to get hold of it then alice thinking it was very like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its mouth and its great eyes half shut ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
and yet what a dear little puppy it was said alice as she leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself with one of the leaves i should have liked teaching it tricks very much ifif id only been the right size to do it oh dear id nearly forgotten that ive got to grow up again let me seehow is it to be managed i suppose i ought to eat or drink something or other but the great question is what ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the great question certainly was what alice looked all round her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under the circumstances there was a large mushroom growing near her about the same height as herself and when she had looked under it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large blue caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice of her or of anything else ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
this was not an encouraging opening for a conversation alice replied rather shyly ii hardly know sir just at presentat least i know who i was when i got up this morning but i think i must have been changed several times since then ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
well perhaps you havent found it so yet said alice but when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you knowand then after that into a butterfly i should think youll feel it a little queer wont you ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation alice felt a little irritated at the caterpillars making such very short remarks and she drew herself up and said very gravely i think you ought to tell me who you are first ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing for some minutes it puffed away without speaking but at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth again and said so you think youre changed do you ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you are old father william the young man said and your hair has become very white and yet you incessantly stand on your head do you think at your age it is right ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
in my youth father william replied to his son i feared it might injure the brain but now that im perfectly sure i have none why i do it again and again ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you are old said the youth as i mentioned before and have grown most uncommonly fat yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door pray what is the reason of that ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
in my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks i kept all my limbs very supple by the use of this ointmentone shilling the box allow me to sell you a couple ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak for anything tougher than suet yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak pray how did you manage to do it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
in my youth said his father i took to the law and argued each case with my wife and the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw has lasted the rest of my life ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you are old said the youth one would hardly suppose that your eye was as steady as ever yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose what made you so awfully clever ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i have answered three questions and that is enough said his father dont give yourself airs do you think i can listen all day to such stuff be off or ill kick you down stairs ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
this time alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again in a minute or two the caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself then it got down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely remarking as it went one side will make you grow taller and the other side will make you grow shorter ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question however at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
come my heads free at last said alice in a tone of delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found all she could see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
what can all that green stuff be said alice and where have my shoulders got to and oh my poor hands how is it i cant see you she was moving them about as she spoke but no result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the distant green leaves ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
as there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction like a serpent she had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating her violently with its wings ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
and just as id taken the highest tree in the wood continued the pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as i was thinking i should be free of them at last they must needs come wriggling down from the sky ugh serpent ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
a likely story indeed said the pigeon in a tone of the deepest contempt ive seen a good many little girls in my time but never one with such a neck as that no no youre a serpent and theres no use denying it i suppose youll be telling me next that you never tasted an egg ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
this was such a new idea to alice that she was quite silent for a minute or two which gave the pigeon the opportunity of adding youre looking for eggs i know that well enough and what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a serpent ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
well be off then said the pigeon in a sulky tone as it settled down again into its nest alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it after a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it was so long since she had been anything near the right size that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a few minutes and began talking to herself as usual come theres half my plan done now how puzzling all these changes are im never sure what im going to be from one minute to another however ive got back to my right size the next thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow is that to be done i wonder as she said this she came suddenly upon an open place with a little house in it about four feet high whoever lives there thought alice itll never do to come upon them this size why i should frighten them out of their wits so she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
for a minute or two she stood looking at the house and wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman because he was in livery otherwise judging by his face only she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door with his knuckles it was opened by another footman in livery with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their heads she felt very curious to know what it was all about and crept a little way out of the wood to listen ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the fishfootman began by producing from under his arm a great letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to the other saying in a solemn tone for the duchess an invitation from the queen to play croquet the frogfootman repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the words a little from the queen an invitation for the duchess to play croquet ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped out the fishfootman was gone and the other was sitting on the ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
theres no sort of use in knocking said the footman and that for two reasons first because im on the same side of the door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise inside no one could possibly hear you and certainly there was a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish or kettle had been broken to pieces ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
there might be some sense in your knocking the footman went on without attending to her if we had the door between us for instance if you were inside you might knock and i could let you out you know he was looking up into the sky all the time he was speaking and this alice thought decidedly uncivil but perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so very nearly at the top of his head but at any rate he might answer questionshow am i to get in she repeated aloud ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the door led right into a large kitchen which was full of smoke from one end to the other the duchess was sitting on a threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to be full of soup ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
there was certainly too much of it in the air even the duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause the only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from ear to ear ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought it would be as well to introduce some other subject of conversation while she was trying to fix on one the cook took the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work throwing everything within her reach at the duchess and the babythe fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans plates and dishes the duchess took no notice of them even when they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
oh please mind what youre doing cried alice jumping up and down in an agony of terror oh there goes his precious nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very nearly carried it off ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
which would not be an advantage said alice who felt very glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her knowledge just think of what work it would make with the day and night you see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn round on its axis ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and seemed not to be listening so she went on again twentyfour hours i think or is it twelve i ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
oh dont bother me said the duchess i never could abide figures and with that she began nursing her child again singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a violent shake at the end of every line ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
speak roughly to your little boy and beat him when he sneezes he only does it to annoy because he knows it teases ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i speak severely to my boy i beat him when he sneezes for he can thoroughly enjoy the pepper when he pleases ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
here you may nurse it a bit if you like the duchess said to alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke i must go and get ready to play croquet with the queen and she hurried out of the room the cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out but it just missed her ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queershaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all directions just like a starfish thought alice the poor little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much as she could do to hold it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
as soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its undoing itself she carried it out into the open air if i dont take this child away with me thought alice theyre sure to kill it in a day or two wouldnt it be murder to leave it behind she said the last words out loud and the little thing grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time dont grunt said alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing yourself ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the baby grunted again and alice looked very anxiously into its face to see what was the matter with it there could be no doubt that it had a very turnup nose much more like a snout than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for a baby altogether alice did not like the look of the thing at all but perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked into its eyes again to see if there were any tears ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
no there were no tears if youre going to turn into a pig my dear said alice seriously ill have nothing more to do with you mind now the poor little thing sobbed again or grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for some while in silence ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice was just beginning to think to herself now what am i to do with this creature when i get it home when it grunted again so violently that she looked down into its face in some alarm this time there could be no mistake about it it was neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be quite absurd for her to carry it further ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
so she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to see it trot away quietly into the wood if it had grown up she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child but it makes rather a handsome pig i think and she began thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing the cheshire cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
cheshire puss she began rather timidly as she did not at all know whether it would like the name however it only grinned a little wider come its pleased so far thought alice and she went on would you tell me please which way i ought to go from here ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the direction in which the march hare was said to live ive seen hatters before she said to herself the march hare will be much the most interesting and perhaps as this is may it wont be raving madat least not so mad as it was in march as she said this she looked up and there was the cat again sitting on a branch of a tree ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the house of the march hare she thought it must be the right house because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was thatched with fur it was so large a house that she did not like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high even then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself suppose it should be raving mad after all i almost wish id gone to see the hatter instead ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
there was a table set out under a tree in front of the house and the march hare and the hatter were having tea at it a dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and talking over its head very uncomfortable for the dormouse thought alice only as its asleep i suppose it doesnt mind ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the table was a large one but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it no room no room they cried out when they saw alice coming theres plenty of room said alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one end of the table ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it is the same thing with you said the hatter and here the conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute while alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and writingdesks which wasnt much ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the hatter was the first to break the silence what day of the month is it he said turning to alice he had taken his watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking it every now and then and holding it to his ear ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the march hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily then he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again but he could think of nothing better to say than his first remark it was the best butter you know ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
ah that accounts for it said the hatter he wont stand beating now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do almost anything you liked with the clock for instance suppose it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons youd only have to whisper a hint to time and round goes the clock in a twinkling halfpast one time for dinner ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the hatter shook his head mournfully not i he replied we quarrelled last marchjust before he went mad you know pointing with his tea spoon at the march hare it was at the great concert given by the queen of hearts and i had to sing ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
theres no such thing alice was beginning very angrily but the hatter and the march hare went sh sh and the dormouse sulkily remarked if you cant be civil youd better finish the story for yourself ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
he moved on as he spoke and the dormouse followed him the march hare moved into the dormouses place and alice rather unwillingly took the place of the march hare the hatter was the only one who got any advantage from the change and alice was a good deal worse off than before as the march hare had just upset the milkjug into his plate ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going off into a doze but on being pinched by the hatter it woke up again with a little shriek and went on that begins with an m such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchnessyou know you say things are much of a muchnessdid you ever see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
this piece of rudeness was more than alice could bear she got up in great disgust and walked off the dormouse fell asleep instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after her the last time she saw them they were trying to put the dormouse into the teapot ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a door leading right into it thats very curious she thought but everythings curious today i think i may as well go in at once and in she went ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the little glass table now ill manage better this time she said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and unlocking the door that led into the garden then she went to work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her pocket till she was about a foot high then she walked down the little passage and thenshe found herself at last in the beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool fountains ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
a large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden the roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at it busily painting them red alice thought this a very curious thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up to them she heard one of them say look out now five dont go splashing paint over me like that ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
seven flung down his brush and had just begun well of all the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon alice as she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly the others looked round also and all of them bowed low ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
five and seven said nothing but looked at two two began in a low voice why the fact is you see miss this here ought to have been a red rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake and if the queen was to find it out we should all have our heads cut off you know so you see miss were doing our best afore she comes to at this moment five who had been anxiously looking across the garden called out the queen the queen and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces there was a sound of many footsteps and alice looked round eager to see the queen ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
first came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and feet at the corners next the ten courtiers these were ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the soldiers did after these came the royal children there were ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand in hand in couples they were all ornamented with hearts next came the guests mostly kings and queens and among them alice recognised the white rabbit it was talking in a hurried nervous manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without noticing her then followed the knave of hearts carrying the kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this grand procession came the king and queen of hearts ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember ever having heard of such a rule at processions and besides what would be the use of a procession thought she if people had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see it so she stood still where she was and waited ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
and who are these said the queen pointing to the three gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her own children ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i see said the queen who had meanwhile been examining the roses off with their heads and the procession moved on three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate gardeners who ran to alice for protection ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you shant be beheaded said alice and she put them into a large flowerpot that stood near the three soldiers wandered about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly marched off after the others ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
hush hush said the rabbit in a low hurried tone he looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and whispered shes under sentence of execution ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she boxed the queens ears the rabbit began alice gave a little scream of laughter oh hush the rabbit whispered in a frightened tone the queen will hear you you see she came rather late and the queen said ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
get to your places shouted the queen in a voice of thunder and people began running about in all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down in a minute or two and the game began alice thought she had never seen such a curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to stand on their hands and feet to make the arches ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the chief difficulty alice found at first was in managing her flamingo she succeeded in getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it would twist itself round and look up in her face with such a puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled itself and was in the act of crawling away besides all this there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the ground alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very difficult game indeed ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the players all played at once without waiting for turns quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in a very short time the queen was in a furious passion and went stamping about and shouting off with his head or off with her head about once in a minute ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice began to feel very uneasy to be sure she had not as yet had any dispute with the queen but she knew that it might happen any minute and then thought she what would become of me theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great wonder is that theres any one left alive ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she was looking about for some way of escape and wondering whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a curious appearance in the air it puzzled her very much at first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to be a grin and she said to herself its the cheshire cat now i shall have somebody to talk to ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded its no use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at least one of them in another minute the whole head appeared and then alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her the cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and no more of it appeared ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i dont think they play at all fairly alice began in rather a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive for instance theres the arch ive got to go through next walking about at the other end of the groundand i should have croqueted the queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it saw mine coming ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game was going on as she heard the queens voice in the distance screaming with passion she had already heard her sentence three of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or not so she went in search of her hedgehog ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog which seemed to alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one of them with the other the only difficulty was that her flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up into a tree ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
by the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight but it doesnt matter much thought alice as all the arches are gone from this side of the ground so she tucked it away under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for a little more conversation with her friend ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
when she got back to the cheshire cat she was surprised to find quite a large crowd collected round it there was a dispute going on between the executioner the king and the queen who were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent and looked very uncomfortable ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the moment alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed to make out exactly what they said ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the queens argument was that if something wasnt done about it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round it was this last remark that had made the whole party look so grave and anxious ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and by the time he had come back with the duchess it had entirely disappeared so the king and the executioner ran wildly up and down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
when im a duchess she said to herself not in a very hopeful tone though i wont have any pepper in my kitchen at all soup does very well withoutmaybe its always pepper that makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar and such things that make children sweettempered i only wish people knew that then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you know ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
she had quite forgotten the duchess by this time and was a little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you forget to talk i cant tell you just now what the moral of that is but i shall remember it in a bit ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice did not much like keeping so close to her first because the duchess was very ugly and secondly because she was exactly the right height to rest her chin upon alices shoulder and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin however she did not like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
ah well it means much the same thing said the duchess digging her sharp little chin into alices shoulder as she added and the moral of that istake care of the sense and the sounds will take care of themselves ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
of course it is said the duchess who seemed ready to agree to everything that alice said theres a large mustardmine near here and the moral of that isthe more there is of mine the less there is of yours ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i quite agree with you said the duchess and the moral of that isbe what you would seem to beor if youd like it put more simplynever imagine yourself not to be otherwise than what it might appear to others that what you were or might have been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared to them to be otherwise ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
but here to alices great surprise the duchesss voice died away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the arm that was linked into hers began to tremble alice looked up and there stood the queen in front of them with her arms folded frowning like a thunderstorm ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the other guests had taken advantage of the queens absence and were resting in the shade however the moment they saw her they hurried back to the game the queen merely remarking that a moments delay would cost them their lives ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
all the time they were playing the queen never left off quarrelling with the other players and shouting off with his head or off with her head those whom she sentenced were taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour or so there were no arches left and all the players except the king the queen and alice were in custody and under sentence of execution ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
as they walked off together alice heard the king say in a low voice to the company generally you are all pardoned come thats a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite unhappy at the number of executions the queen had ordered ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
they very soon came upon a gryphon lying fast asleep in the sun if you dont know what a gryphon is look at the picture up lazy thing said the queen and take this young lady to see the mock turtle and to hear his history i must go back and see after some executions i have ordered and she walked off leaving alice alone with the gryphon alice did not quite like the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage queen so she waited ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
they had not gone far before they saw the mock turtle in the distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and as they came nearer alice could hear him sighing as if his heart would break she pitied him deeply what is his sorrow she asked the gryphon and the gryphon answered very nearly in the same words as before its all his fancy that he hasnt got no sorrow you know come on ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
these words were followed by a very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation of hjckrrh from the gryphon and the constant heavy sobbing of the mock turtle alice was very nearly getting up and saying thank you sir for your interesting story but she could not help thinking there must be more to come so she sat still and said nothing ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple question added the gryphon and then they both sat silent and looked at poor alice who felt ready to sink into the earth at last the gryphon said to the mock turtle drive on old fellow dont be all day about it and he went on in these words ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
well there was mystery the mock turtle replied counting off the subjects on his flappers mystery ancient and modern with seaography then drawlingthe drawlingmaster was an old congereel that used to come once a week he taught us drawling stretching and fainting in coils ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the mock turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper across his eyes he looked at alice and tried to speak but for a minute or two sobs choked his voice same as if he had a bone in his throat said the gryphon and it set to work shaking him and punching him in the back at last the mock turtle recovered his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on again ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you may not have lived much under the sea i havent said aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster alice began to say i once tasted but checked herself hastily and said no never so you can have no idea what a delightful thing a lobster quadrille is ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
back to land again and thats all the first figure said the mock turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat down again very sadly and quietly and looked at alice ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
so they began solemnly dancing round and round alice every now and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and waving their forepaws to mark the time while the mock turtle sang this very slowly and sadly ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
will you walk a little faster said a whiting to a snail theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my tail see how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance they are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
you can really have no notion how delightful it will be when they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to sea but the snail replied too far too far and gave a look askance said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the dance would not could not would not could not would not join the dance would not could not would not could not could not join the dance ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
what matters it how far we go his scaly friend replied there is another shore you know upon the other side the further off from england the nearer is to france then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance will you wont you will you wont you will you join the dance will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the dance ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
youre wrong about the crumbs said the mock turtle crumbs would all wash off in the sea but they have their tails in their mouths and the reason is here the mock turtle yawned and shut his eyestell her about the reason and all that he said to the gryphon ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the reason is said the gryphon that they would go with the lobsters to the dance so they got thrown out to sea so they had to fall a long way so they got their tails fast in their mouths so they couldnt get them out again thats all ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
so alice began telling them her adventures from the time when she first saw the white rabbit she was a little nervous about it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on each side and opened their eyes and mouths so very wide but she gained courage as she went on her listeners were perfectly quiet till she got to the part about her repeating you are old father william to the caterpillar and the words all coming different and then the mock turtle drew a long breath and said thats very curious ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
it all came different the mock turtle repeated thoughtfully i should like to hear her try and repeat something now tell her to begin he looked at the gryphon as if he thought it had some kind of authority over alice ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
how the creatures order one about and make one repeat lessons thought alice i might as well be at school at once however she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so full of the lobster quadrille that she hardly knew what she was saying and the words came very queer indeed ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
tis the voice of the lobster i heard him declare you have baked me too brown i must sugar my hair as a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
later editions continued as follows when the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark and will talk in contemptuous tones of the shark but when the tide rises and sharks are around his voice has a timid and tremulous sound ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
later editions continued as follows the panther took piecrust and gravy and meat while the owl had the dish as its share of the treat when the pie was all finished the owl as a boon was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon while the panther received knife and fork with a growl and concluded the banquet ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
oh a song please if the mock turtle would be so kind alice replied so eagerly that the gryphon said in a rather offended tone hm no accounting for tastes sing her turtle soup will you old fellow ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
beautiful soup so rich and green waiting in a hot tureen who for such dainties would not stoop soup of the evening beautiful soup soup of the evening beautiful soup beauootiful soooop beauootiful soooop soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
beautiful soup who cares for fish game or any other dish who would not give all else for two p ennyworth only of beautiful soup pennyworth only of beautiful soup beauootiful soooop beauootiful soooop soooop of the eeevening beautiful beautiful soup ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the king and queen of hearts were seated on their throne when they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards the knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on each side to guard him and near the king was the white rabbit with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the other in the very middle of the court was a table with a large dish of tarts upon it they looked so good that it made alice quite hungry to look at themi wish theyd get the trial done she thought and hand round the refreshments but there seemed to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about her to pass away the time ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that she knew the name of nearly everything there thats the judge she said to herself because of his great wig ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
and thats the jurybox thought alice and those twelve creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because some of them were animals and some were birds i suppose they are the jurors she said this last word two or three times over to herself being rather proud of it for she thought and rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the meaning of it at all however jurymen would have done just as well ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
stupid things alice began in a loud indignant voice but she stopped hastily for the white rabbit cried out silence in the court and the king put on his spectacles and looked anxiously round to make out who was talking ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice could see as well as if she were looking over their shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things on their slates and she could even make out that one of them didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his neighbour to tell him a nice muddle their slatesll be in before the trials over thought alice ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
one of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked this of course alice could not stand and she went round the court and got behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it away she did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was bill the lizard could not make out at all what had become of it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very little use as it left no mark on the slate ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the queen of hearts she made some tarts all on a summer day the knave of hearts he stole those tarts and took them quite away ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the first witness was the hatter he came in with a teacup in one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other i beg pardon your majesty he began for bringing these in but i hadnt quite finished my tea when i was sent for ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
this did not seem to encourage the witness at all he kept shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his teacup instead of the breadandbutter ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
just at this moment alice felt a very curious sensation which puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was she was beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for her ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
all this time the queen had never left off staring at the hatter and just as the dormouse crossed the court she said to one of the officers of the court bring me the list of the singers in the last concert on which the wretched hatter trembled so that he shook both his shoes off ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court as that is rather a hard word i will just explain to you how it was done they had a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat upon it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
im glad ive seen that done thought alice ive so often read in the newspapers at the end of trials there was some attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the officers of the court and i never understood what it meant till now ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
never mind said the king with an air of great relief call the next witness and he added in an undertone to the queen really my dear you must crossexamine the next witness it quite makes my forehead ache ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice watched the white rabbit as he fumbled over the list feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like for they havent got much evidence yet she said to herself imagine her surprise when the white rabbit read out at the top of his shrill little voice the name alice ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
here cried alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset the week before ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
oh i beg your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once and put back into the jurybox or they would die ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she had put the lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable to move she soon got it out again and put it right not that it signifies much she said to herself i should think it would be quite as much use in the trial one way up as the other ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
as soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write out a history of the accident all except the lizard who seemed too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open gazing up into the roof of the court ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
thats very important the king said turning to the jury they were just beginning to write this down on their slates when the white rabbit interrupted unimportant your majesty means of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and making faces at him as he spoke ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
they told me you had been to her and mentioned me to him she gave me a good character but said i could not swim ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
he sent them word i had not gone we know it to be true if she should push the matter on what would become of you ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
i gave her one they gave him two you gave us three or more they all returned from him to you though they were mine before ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
if i or she should chance to be involved in this affair he trusts to you to set them free exactly as we were ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
my notion was that you had been before she had this fit an obstacle that came between him and ourselves and it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
dont let him know she liked them best for this must ever be a secret kept from all the rest between yourself and me ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
if any one of them can explain it said alice she had grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit afraid of interrupting him ill give him sixpence i dont believe theres an atom of meaning in it ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
if theres no meaning in it said the king that saves a world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any and yet i dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his knee and looking at them with one eye i seem to see some meaning in them after all said i could not swim you cant swim can you he added turning to the knave ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
all right so far said the king and he went on muttering over the verses to himself we know it to be true thats the jury of coursei gave her one they gave him two why that must be what he did with the tarts you know ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
why there they are said the king triumphantly pointing to the tarts on the table nothing can be clearer than that then againbefore she had this fit you never had fits my dear i think he said to the queen ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
never said the queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the lizard as she spoke the unfortunate little bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was trickling down his face as long as it lasted ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
at this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying down upon her she gave a little scream half of fright and half of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the trees upon her face ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
oh ive had such a curious dream said alice and she told her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and when she had finished her sister kissed her and said it was a curious dream dear certainly but now run in to your tea its getting late so alice got up and ran off thinking while she ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
but her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of little alice and all her wonderful adventures till she too began dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
first she dreamed of little alice herself and once again the tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back the wandering hair that would always get into her eyesand still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place around her became alive with the strange creatures of her little sisters dream ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
the long grass rustled at her feet as the white rabbit hurried bythe frightened mouse splashed his way through the neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as the march hare and his friends shared their neverending meal and the shrill voice of the queen ordering off her unfortunate guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce more the shriek of the gryphon the squeaking of the lizards slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable mock turtle ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
so she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheepbells and the queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the gryphon and all the other queer noises would change she knew to the confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the cattle in the distance would take the place of the mock turtles heavy sobs ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how she would keep through all her riper years the simple and loving heart of her childhood and how she would gather about her other little children and make their eyes bright and eager with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of wonderland of long ago and how she would feel with all their simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days ,Alices Adventures in Wonderland
however little known the feelings or views of such a man may be on his first entering a neighbourhood this truth is so well fixed in the minds of the surrounding families that he is considered as the rightful property of some one or other of their daughters ,Pride and Prejudice
why my dear you must know mrs long says that netherfield is taken by a young man of large fortune from the north of england that he came down on monday in a chaise and four to see the place and was so much delighted with it that he agreed with mr morris immediately that he is to take possession before michaelmas and some of his servants are to be in the house by the end of next week ,Pride and Prejudice
i see no occasion for that you and the girls may go or you may send them by themselves which perhaps will be still better for as you are as handsome as any of them mr bingley might like you the best of the party ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear you flatter me i certainly have had my share of beauty but i do not pretend to be anything extraordinary now when a woman has five grownup daughters she ought to give over thinking of her own beauty ,Pride and Prejudice
but consider your daughters only think what an establishment it would be for one of them sir william and lady lucas are determined to go merely on that account for in general you know they visit no newcomers indeed you must go for it will be impossible for us to visit him if you do not ,Pride and Prejudice
you are over scrupulous surely i dare say mr bingley will be very glad to see you and i will send a few lines by you to assure him of my hearty consent to his marrying whichever he chooses of the girls though i must throw in a good word for my little lizzy ,Pride and Prejudice
i desire you will do no such thing lizzy is not a bit better than the others and i am sure she is not half so handsome as jane nor half so goodhumoured as lydia but you are always giving her the preference ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennet was so odd a mixture of quick parts sarcastic humour reserve and caprice that the experience of threeandtwenty years had been insufficient to make his wife understand his character her mind was less difficult to develop she was a woman of mean understanding little information and uncertain temper when she was discontented she fancied herself nervous the business of her life was to get her daughters married its solace was visiting and news ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennet was among the earliest of those who waited on mr bingley he had always intended to visit him though to the last always assuring his wife that he should not go and till the evening after the visit was paid she had no knowledge of it it was then disclosed in the following manner observing his second daughter employed in trimming a hat he suddenly addressed her with ,Pride and Prejudice
i honour your circumspection a fortnights acquaintance is certainly very little one cannot know what a man really is by the end of a fortnight but if we do not venture somebody else will and after all mrs long and her nieces must stand their chance and therefore as she will think it an act of kindness if you decline the office i will take it on myself ,Pride and Prejudice
what can be the meaning of that emphatic exclamation cried he do you consider the forms of introduction and the stress that is laid on them as nonsense i cannot quite agree with you there what say you mary for you are a young lady of deep reflection i know and read great books and make extracts ,Pride and Prejudice
i am sorry to hear that but why did not you tell me so before if i had known as much this morning i certainly would not have called on him it is very unlucky but as i have actually paid the visit we cannot escape the acquaintance now ,Pride and Prejudice
the astonishment of the ladies was just what he wished that of mrs bennet perhaps surpassing the rest though when the first tumult of joy was over she began to declare that it was what she had expected all the while ,Pride and Prejudice
how good it was in you my dear mr bennet but i knew i should persuade you at last i was sure you loved your girls too well to neglect such an acquaintance well how pleased i am and it is such a good joke too that you should have gone this morning and never said a word about it till now ,Pride and Prejudice
what an excellent father you have girls said she when the door was shut i do not know how you will ever make him amends for his kindness or me either for that matter at our time of life it is not so pleasant i can tell you to be making new acquaintance every day but for your sakes we would do anything lydia my love though you are the youngest i dare say mr bingley will dance with you at the next ball ,Pride and Prejudice
not all that mrs bennet however with the assistance of her five daughters could ask on the subject was sufficient to draw from her husband any satisfactory description of mr bingley they attacked him in various ways with barefaced questions ingenious suppositions and distant surmises but he eluded the skill of them all and they were at last obliged to accept the secondhand intelligence of their neighbour lady lucas her report was highly favourable sir william had been delighted with him he was quite young wonderfully handsome extremely agreeable and to crown the whole he meant to be at the next assembly with a large party nothing could be more delightful to be fond of dancing was a certain step towards falling in love and very lively hopes of mr bingleys heart were entertained ,Pride and Prejudice
in a few days mr bingley returned mr bennets visit and sat about ten minutes with him in his library he had entertained hopes of being admitted to a sight of the young ladies of whose beauty he had heard much but he saw only the father the ladies were somewhat more fortunate for they had the advantage of ascertaining from an upper window that he wore a blue coat and rode a black horse ,Pride and Prejudice
an invitation to dinner was soon afterwards dispatched and already had mrs bennet planned the courses that were to do credit to her housekeeping when an answer arrived which deferred it all mr bingley was obliged to be in town the following day and consequently unable to accept the honour of their invitation etc mrs bennet was quite disconcerted she could not imagine what business he could have in town so soon after his arrival in hertfordshire and she began to fear that he might be always flying about from one place to another and never settled at netherfield as he ought to be lady lucas quieted her fears a little by starting the idea of his being gone to london only to get a large party for the ball and a report soon followed that mr bingley was to bring twelve ladies and seven gentlemen with him to the assembly the girls grieved over such a number of ladies but were comforted the day before the ball by hearing that instead of twelve he had brought only six with him from london his five sisters and a cousin and when the party entered the assembly room it consisted of only five altogether mr bingley his two sisters the husband of the eldest and another young man ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bingley was goodlooking and gentlemanlike he had a pleasant countenance and easy unaffected manners his sisters were fine women with an air of decided fashion his brotherinlaw mr hurst merely looked the gentleman but his friend mr darcy soon drew the attention of the room by his fine tall person handsome features noble mien and the report which was in general circulation within five minutes after his entrance of his having ten thousand a year the gentlemen pronounced him to be a fine figure of a man the ladies declared he was much handsomer than mr bingley and he was looked at with great admiration for about half the evening till his manners gave a disgust which turned the tide of his popularity for he was discovered to be proud to be above his company and above being pleased and not all his large estate in derbyshire could then save him from having a most forbidding disagreeable countenance and being unworthy to be compared with his friend ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bingley had soon made himself acquainted with all the principal people in the room he was lively and unreserved danced every dance was angry that the ball closed so early and talked of giving one himself at netherfield such amiable qualities must speak for themselves what a contrast between him and his friend mr darcy danced only once with mrs hurst and once with miss bingley declined being introduced to any other lady and spent the rest of the evening in walking about the room speaking occasionally to one of his own party his character was decided he was the proudest most disagreeable man in the world and everybody hoped that he would never come there again amongst the most violent against him was mrs bennet whose dislike of his general behaviour was sharpened into particular resentment by his having slighted one of her daughters ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth bennet had been obliged by the scarcity of gentlemen to sit down for two dances and during part of that time mr darcy had been standing near enough for her to overhear a conversation between him and mr bingley who came from the dance for a few minutes to press his friend to join it ,Pride and Prejudice
i certainly shall not you know how i detest it unless i am particularly acquainted with my partner at such an assembly as this it would be insupportable your sisters are engaged and there is not another woman in the room whom it would not be a punishment to me to stand up with ,Pride and Prejudice
i would not be so fastidious as you are cried bingley for a kingdom upon my honour i never met with so many pleasant girls in my life as i have this evening and there are several of them you see uncommonly pretty ,Pride and Prejudice
oh she is the most beautiful creature i ever beheld but there is one of her sisters sitting down just behind you who is very pretty and i dare say very agreeable do let me ask my partner to introduce you ,Pride and Prejudice
which do you mean and turning round he looked for a moment at elizabeth till catching her eye he withdrew his own and coldly said she is tolerable but not handsome enough to tempt me and i am in no humour at present to give consequence to young ladies who are slighted by other men you had better return to your partner and enjoy her smiles for you are wasting your time with me ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bingley followed his advice mr darcy walked off and elizabeth remained with no very cordial feelings towards him she told the story however with great spirit among her friends for she had a lively playful disposition which delighted in anything ridiculous ,Pride and Prejudice
the evening altogether passed off pleasantly to the whole family mrs bennet had seen her eldest daughter much admired by the netherfield party mr bingley had danced with her twice and she had been distinguished by his sisters jane was as much gratified by this as her mother could be though in a quieter way elizabeth felt janes pleasure mary had heard herself mentioned to miss bingley as the most accomplished girl in the neighbourhood and catherine and lydia had been fortunate enough to be never without partners which was all that they had yet learnt to care for at a ball they returned therefore in good spirits to longbourn the village where they lived and of which they were the principal inhabitants they found mr bennet still up with a book he was regardless of time and on the present occasion he had a good deal of curiosity as to the event of an evening which had raised such splendid expectations he had rather hoped that all his wifes views on the stranger would be disappointed but he soon found that he had a very different story to hear ,Pride and Prejudice
oh my dear mr bennet as she entered the room we have had a most delightful evening a most excellent ball i wish you had been there jane was so admired nothing could be like it everybody said how well she looked and mr bingley thought her quite beautiful and danced with her twice only think of that my dear he actually danced with her twice and she was the only creature in the room that he asked a second time first of all he asked miss lucas i was so vexed to see him stand up with her but however he did not admire her at all indeed nobody can you know and he seemed quite struck with jane as she was going down the dance so he enquired who she was and got introduced and asked her for the two next then the two third he danced with miss king and the two fourth with maria lucas and the two fifth with jane again and the two sixth with lizzy and the boulanger ,Pride and Prejudice
if he had had any compassion for me cried her husband impatiently he would not have danced half so much for gods sake say no more of his partners oh that he had sprained his ankle in the first dance ,Pride and Prejudice
oh my dear continued mrs bennet i am quite delighted with him he is so excessively handsome and his sisters are charming women i never in my life saw anything more elegant than their dresses i dare say the lace upon mrs hursts gown ,Pride and Prejudice
here she was interrupted again mr bennet protested against any description of finery she was therefore obliged to seek another branch of the subject and related with much bitterness of spirit and some exaggeration the shocking rudeness of mr darcy ,Pride and Prejudice
but i can assure you she added that lizzy does not lose much by not suiting his fancy for he is a most disagreeable horrid man not at all worth pleasing so high and so conceited that there was no enduring him he walked here and he walked there fancying himself so very great not handsome enough to dance with i wish you had been there my dear to have given him one of your setdowns i quite detest the man ,Pride and Prejudice
did not you i did for you but that is one great difference between us compliments always take you by surprise and me never what could be more natural than his asking you again he could not help seeing that you were about five times as pretty as every other woman in the room no thanks to his gallantry for that well he certainly is very agreeable and i give you leave to like him you have liked many a stupider person ,Pride and Prejudice
oh you are a great deal too apt you know to like people in general you never see a fault in anybody all the world are good and agreeable in your eyes i never heard you speak ill of a human being in my life ,Pride and Prejudice
i know you do and it is that which makes the wonder with your good sense to be so honestly blind to the follies and nonsense of others affectation of candour is common enoughone meets with it everywhere but to be candid without ostentation or designto take the good of everybodys character and make it still better and say nothing of the badbelongs to you alone and so you like this mans sisters too do you their manners are not equal to his ,Pride and Prejudice
certainly not at first but they are very pleasing women when you converse with them miss bingley is to live with her brother and keep his house and i am much mistaken if we shall not find a very charming neighbour in her ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth listened in silence but was not convinced their behaviour at the assembly had not been calculated to please in general and with more quickness of observation and less pliancy of temper than her sister and with a judgment too unassailed by any attention to herself she was very little disposed to approve them they were in fact very fine ladies not deficient in good humour when they were pleased nor in the power of being agreeable where they chose it but proud and conceited they were rather handsome had been educated in one of the first private seminaries in town had a fortune of twenty thousand pounds were in the habit of spending more than they ought and of associating with people of rank and were therefore in every respect entitled to think well of themselves and meanly of others they were of a respectable family in the north of england a circumstance more deeply impressed on their memories than that their brothers fortune and their own had been acquired by trade ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bingley inherited property to the amount of nearly a hundred thousand pounds from his father who had intended to purchase an estate but did not live to do it mr bingley intended it likewise and sometimes made choice of his county but as he was now provided with a good house and the liberty of a manor it was doubtful to many of those who best knew the easiness of his temper whether he might not spend the remainder of his days at netherfield and leave the next generation to purchase ,Pride and Prejudice
his sisters were very anxious for his having an estate of his own but though he was now established only as a tenant miss bingley was by no means unwilling to preside at his table nor was mrs hurst who had married a man of more fashion than fortune less disposed to consider his house as her home when it suited her mr bingley had not been of age two years when he was tempted by an accidental recommendation to look at netherfield house he did look at it and into it for half an hour was pleased with the situation and the principal rooms satisfied with what the owner said in its praise and took it immediately ,Pride and Prejudice
between him and darcy there was a very steady friendship in spite of great opposition of character bingley was endeared to darcy by the easiness openness and ductility of his temper though no disposition could offer a greater contrast to his own and though with his own he never appeared dissatisfied on the strength of darcys regard bingley had the firmest reliance and of his judgment the highest opinion in understanding darcy was the superior bingley was by no means deficient but darcy was clever he was at the same time haughty reserved and fastidious and his manners though well bred were not inviting in that respect his friend had greatly the advantage bingley was sure of being liked wherever he appeared darcy was continually giving offence ,Pride and Prejudice
the manner in which they spoke of the meryton assembly was sufficiently characteristic bingley had never met with pleasanter people or prettier girls in his life everybody had been most kind and attentive to him there had been no formality no stiffness he had soon felt acquainted with all the room and as to miss bennet he could not conceive an angel more beautiful darcy on the contrary had seen a collection of people in whom there was little beauty and no fashion for none of whom he had felt the smallest interest and from none received either attention or pleasure miss bennet he acknowledged to be pretty but she smiled too much ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs hurst and her sister allowed it to be sobut still they admired her and liked her and pronounced her to be a sweet girl and one whom they should not object to know more of miss bennet was therefore established as a sweet girl and their brother felt authorised by such commendation to think of her as he chose ,Pride and Prejudice
within a short walk of longbourn lived a family with whom the bennets were particularly intimate sir william lucas had been formerly in trade in meryton where he had made a tolerable fortune and risen to the honour of knighthood by an address to the king during his mayoralty the distinction had perhaps been felt too strongly it had given him a disgust to his business and to his residence in a small market town and quitting them both he had removed with his family to a house about a mile from meryton denominated from that period lucas lodge where he could think with pleasure of his own importance and unshackled by business occupy himself solely in being civil to all the world for though elated by his rank it did not render him supercilious on the contrary he was all attention to everybody by nature inoffensive friendly and obliging his presentation at st jamess had made him courteous ,Pride and Prejudice
lady lucas was a very good kind of woman not too clever to be a valuable neighbour to mrs bennet they had several children the eldest of them a sensible intelligent young woman about twentyseven was elizabeths intimate friend ,Pride and Prejudice
that the miss lucases and the miss bennets should meet to talk over a ball was absolutely necessary and the morning after the assembly brought the former to longbourn to hear and to communicate ,Pride and Prejudice
oh you mean jane i suppose because he danced with her twice to be sure that did seem as if he admired herindeed i rather believe he didi heard something about itbut i hardly know whatsomething about mr robinson ,Pride and Prejudice
perhaps you mean what i overheard between him and mr robinson did not i mention it to you mr robinsons asking him how he liked our meryton assemblies and whether he did not think there were a great many pretty women in the room and which he thought the prettiest and his answering immediately to the last questionoh the eldest miss bennet beyond a doubt there cannot be two opinions on that point ,Pride and Prejudice
i beg you would not put it into lizzys head to be vexed by his illtreatment for he is such a disagreeable man that it would be quite a misfortune to be liked by him mrs long told me last night that he sat close to her for half an hour without once opening his lips ,Pride and Prejudice
i do not believe a word of it my dear if he had been so very agreeable he would have talked to mrs long but i can guess how it was everybody says that he is eat up with pride and i dare say he had heard somehow that mrs long does not keep a carriage and had come to the ball in a hack chaise ,Pride and Prejudice
his pride said miss lucas does not offend me so much as pride often does because there is an excuse for it one cannot wonder that so very fine a young man with family fortune everything in his favour should think highly of himself if i may so express it he has a right to be proud ,Pride and Prejudice
pride observed mary who piqued herself upon the solidity of her reflections is a very common failing i believe by all that i have ever read i am convinced that it is very common indeed that human nature is particularly prone to it and that there are very few of us who do not cherish a feeling of selfcomplacency on the score of some quality or other real or imaginary vanity and pride are different things though the words are often used synonymously a person may be proud without being vain pride relates more to our opinion of ourselves vanity to what we would have others think of us ,Pride and Prejudice
the ladies of longbourn soon waited on those of netherfield the visit was returned in due form miss bennets pleasing manners grew on the goodwill of mrs hurst and miss bingley and though the mother was found to be intolerable and the younger sisters not worth speaking to a wish of being better acquainted with them was expressed towards the two eldest by jane this attention was received with the greatest pleasure but elizabeth still saw superciliousness in their treatment of everybody hardly excepting even her sister and could not like them though their kindness to jane such as it was had a value as arising in all probability from the influence of their brothers admiration it was generally evident whenever they met that he did admire her and to her it was equally evident that jane was yielding to the preference which she had begun to entertain for him from the first and was in a way to be very much in love but she considered with pleasure that it was not likely to be discovered by the world in general since jane united with great strength of feeling a composure of temper and a uniform cheerfulness of manner which would guard her from the suspicions of the impertinent she mentioned this to her friend miss lucas ,Pride and Prejudice
it may perhaps be pleasant replied charlotte to be able to impose on the public in such a case but it is sometimes a disadvantage to be so very guarded if a woman conceals her affection with the same skill from the object of it she may lose the opportunity of fixing him and it will then be but poor consolation to believe the world equally in the dark there is so much of gratitude or vanity in almost every attachment that it is not safe to leave any to itself we can all begin freelya slight preference is natural enough but there are very few of us who have heart enough to be really in love without encouragement in nine cases out of ten a woman had better show more affection than she feels bingley likes your sister undoubtedly but he may never do more than like her if she does not help him on ,Pride and Prejudice
perhaps he must if he sees enough of her but though bingley and jane meet tolerably often it is never for many hours together and as they always see each other in large mixed parties it is impossible that every moment should be employed in conversing together jane should therefore make the most of every halfhour in which she can command his attention when she is secure of him there will be leisure for falling in love as much as she chooses ,Pride and Prejudice
your plan is a good one replied elizabeth where nothing is in question but the desire of being well married and if i were determined to get a rich husband or any husband i dare say i should adopt it but these are not janes feelings she is not acting by design as yet she cannot even be certain of the degree of her own regard nor of its reasonableness she has known him only a fortnight she danced four dances with him at meryton she saw him one morning at his own house and has since dined in company with him four times this is not quite enough to make her understand his character ,Pride and Prejudice
not as you represent it had she merely dined with him she might only have discovered whether he had a good appetite but you must remember that four evenings have been also spent togetherand four evenings may do a great deal ,Pride and Prejudice
yes these four evenings have enabled them to ascertain that they both like vingtun better than commerce but with respect to any other leading characteristic i do not imagine that much has been unfolded ,Pride and Prejudice
well said charlotte i wish jane success with all my heart and if she were married to him tomorrow i should think she had as good a chance of happiness as if she were to be studying his character for a twelvemonth happiness in marriage is entirely a matter of chance if the dispositions of the parties are ever so well known to each other or ever so similar beforehand it does not advance their felicity in the least they always continue to grow sufficiently unlike afterwards to have their share of vexation and it is better to know as little as possible of the defects of the person with whom you are to pass your life ,Pride and Prejudice
occupied in observing mr bingleys attentions to her sister elizabeth was far from suspecting that she was herself becoming an object of some interest in the eyes of his friend mr darcy had at first scarcely allowed her to be pretty he had looked at her without admiration at the ball and when they next met he looked at her only to criticise but no sooner had he made it clear to himself and his friends that she had hardly a good feature in her face than he began to find it was rendered uncommonly intelligent by the beautiful expression of her dark eyes to this discovery succeeded some others equally mortifying though he had detected with a critical eye more than one failure of perfect symmetry in her form he was forced to acknowledge her figure to be light and pleasing and in spite of his asserting that her manners were not those of the fashionable world he was caught by their easy playfulness of this she was perfectly unawareto her he was only the man who made himself agreeable nowhere and who had not thought her handsome enough to dance with ,Pride and Prejudice
he began to wish to know more of her and as a step towards conversing with her himself attended to her conversation with others his doing so drew her notice it was at sir william lucass where a large party were assembled ,Pride and Prejudice
but if he does it any more i shall certainly let him know that i see what he is about he has a very satirical eye and if i do not begin by being impertinent myself i shall soon grow afraid of him ,Pride and Prejudice
on his approaching them soon afterwards though without seeming to have any intention of speaking miss lucas defied her friend to mention such a subject to him which immediately provoking elizabeth to do it she turned to him and said ,Pride and Prejudice
you are a very strange creature by way of a friendalways wanting me to play and sing before anybody and everybody if my vanity had taken a musical turn you would have been invaluable but as it is i would really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of hearing the very best performers on miss lucass persevering however she added very well if it must be so it must and gravely glancing at mr darcy there is a fine old saying which everybody here is of course familiar withkeep your breath to cool your porridgeand i shall keep mine to swell my song ,Pride and Prejudice
her performance was pleasing though by no means capital after a song or two and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she would sing again she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her sister mary who having in consequence of being the only plain one in the family worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments was always impatient for display ,Pride and Prejudice
mary had neither genius nor taste and though vanity had given her application it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited manner which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she had reached elizabeth easy and unaffected had been listened to with much more pleasure though not playing half so well and mary at the end of a long concerto was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by scotch and irish airs at the request of her younger sisters who with some of the lucases and two or three officers joined eagerly in dancing at one end of the room ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of passing the evening to the exclusion of all conversation and was too much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that sir william lucas was his neighbour till sir william thus began ,Pride and Prejudice
sir william only smiled your friend performs delightfully he continued after a pause on seeing bingley join the group and i doubt not that you are an adept in the science yourself mr darcy ,Pride and Prejudice
he paused in hopes of an answer but his companion was not disposed to make any and elizabeth at that instant moving towards them he was struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing and called out to her ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear miss eliza why are not you dancing mr darcy you must allow me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner you cannot refuse to dance i am sure when so much beauty is before you and taking her hand he would have given it to mr darcy who though extremely surprised was not unwilling to receive it when she instantly drew back and said with some discomposure to sir william ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy with grave propriety requested to be allowed the honour of her hand but in vain elizabeth was determined nor did sir william at all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion ,Pride and Prejudice
you excel so much in the dance miss eliza that it is cruel to deny me the happiness of seeing you and though this gentleman dislikes the amusement in general he can have no objection i am sure to oblige us for one halfhour ,Pride and Prejudice
you are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many evenings in this mannerin such society and indeed i am quite of your opinion i was never more annoyed the insipidity and yet the noise the nothingness and yet the selfimportance of all these people what would i give to hear your strictures on them ,Pride and Prejudice
your conjecture is totally wrong i assure you my mind was more agreeably engaged i have been meditating on the very great pleasure which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow ,Pride and Prejudice
that is exactly the question which i expected you to ask a ladys imagination is very rapid it jumps from admiration to love from love to matrimony in a moment i knew you would be wishing me joy ,Pride and Prejudice
nay if you are so serious about it i shall consider the matter as absolutely settled you will have a charming motherinlaw indeed and of course she will be always at pemberley with you ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennets property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two thousand a year which unfortunately for his daughters was entailed in default of heirs male on a distant relation and their mothers fortune though ample for her situation in life could but ill supply the deficiency of his her father had been an attorney in meryton and had left her four thousand pounds ,Pride and Prejudice
the village of longbourn was only one mile from meryton a most convenient distance for the young ladies who were usually tempted thither three or four times a week to pay their duty to their aunt and to a milliners shop just over the way the two youngest of the family catherine and lydia were particularly frequent in these attentions their minds were more vacant than their sisters and when nothing better offered a walk to meryton was necessary to amuse their morning hours and furnish conversation for the evening and however bare of news the country in general might be they always contrived to learn some from their aunt at present indeed they were well supplied both with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in the neighbourhood it was to remain the whole winter and meryton was the headquarters ,Pride and Prejudice
their visits to mrs philips were now productive of the most interesting intelligence every day added something to their knowledge of the officers names and connections their lodgings were not long a secret and at length they began to know the officers themselves mr philips visited them all and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity unknown before they could talk of nothing but officers and mr bingleys large fortune the mention of which gave animation to their mother was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of an ensign ,Pride and Prejudice
catherine was disconcerted and made no answer but lydia with perfect indifference continued to express her admiration of captain carter and her hope of seeing him in the course of the day as he was going the next morning to london ,Pride and Prejudice
i am astonished my dear said mrs bennet that you should be so ready to think your own children silly if i wished to think slightingly of anybodys children it should not be of my own however ,Pride and Prejudice
this is the only point i flatter myself on which we do not agree i had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular but i must so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly foolish ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear mr bennet you must not expect such girls to have the sense of their father and mother when they get to our age i dare say they will not think about officers any more than we do i remember the time when i liked a red coat myself very welland indeed so i do still at my heart and if a smart young colonel with five or six thousand a year should want one of my girls i shall not say nay to him and i thought colonel forster looked very becoming the other night at sir williams in his regimentals ,Pride and Prejudice
mamma cried lydia my aunt says that colonel forster and captain carter do not go so often to miss watsons as they did when they first came she sees them now very often standing in clarkes library ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a note for miss bennet it came from netherfield and the servant waited for an answer mrs bennets eyes sparkled with pleasure and she was eagerly calling out while her daughter read ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear friend if you are not so compassionate as to dine today with louisa and me we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our lives for a whole days ttette between two women can never end without a quarrel come as soon as you can on the receipt of this my brother and the gentlemen are to dine with the officersyours ever ,Pride and Prejudice
she did at last extort from her father an acknowledgment that the horses were engaged jane was therefore obliged to go on horseback and her mother attended her to the door with many cheerful prognostics of a bad day her hopes were answered jane had not been gone long before it rained hard her sisters were uneasy for her but her mother was delighted the rain continued the whole evening without intermission jane certainly could not come back ,Pride and Prejudice
this was a lucky idea of mine indeed said mrs bennet more than once as if the credit of making it rain were all her own till the next morning however she was not aware of all the felicity of her contrivance breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from netherfield brought the following note for elizabeth ,Pride and Prejudice
my dearest lizzy i find myself very unwell this morning which i suppose is to be imputed to my getting wet through yesterday my kind friends will not hear of my returning home till i am better they insist also on my seeing mr jonestherefore do not be alarmed if you should hear of his having been to meand excepting a sore throat and headache there is not much the matter with meyours c ,Pride and Prejudice
well my dear said mr bennet when elizabeth had read the note aloud if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illnessif she should die it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of mr bingley and under your orders ,Pride and Prejudice
oh i am not at all afraid of her dying people do not die of little trifling colds she will be taken good care of as long as she stays there it is all very well i would go and see her if i could have the carriage ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth feeling really anxious was determined to go to her though the carriage was not to be had and as she was no horsewoman walking was her only alternative she declared her resolution ,Pride and Prejudice
i admire the activity of your benevolence observed mary but every impulse of feeling should be guided by reason and in my opinion exertion should always be in proportion to what is required ,Pride and Prejudice
in meryton they parted the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one of the officers wives and elizabeth continued her walk alone crossing field after field at a quick pace jumping over stiles and springing over puddles with impatient activity and finding herself at last within view of the house with weary ankles dirty stockings and a face glowing with the warmth of exercise ,Pride and Prejudice
she was shown into the breakfastparlour where all but jane were assembled and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise that she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such dirty weather and by herself was almost incredible to mrs hurst and miss bingley and elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt for it she was received however very politely by them and in their brothers manners there was something better than politeness there was good humour and kindness mr darcy said very little and mr hurst nothing at all the former was divided between admiration of the brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to the occasions justifying her coming so far alone the latter was thinking only of his breakfast ,Pride and Prejudice
her enquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered miss bennet had slept ill and though up was very feverish and not well enough to leave her room elizabeth was glad to be taken to her immediately and jane who had only been withheld by the fear of giving alarm or inconvenience from expressing in her note how much she longed for such a visit was delighted at her entrance she was not equal however to much conversation and when miss bingley left them together could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the extraordinary kindness she was treated with elizabeth silently attended her ,Pride and Prejudice
when breakfast was over they were joined by the sisters and elizabeth began to like them herself when she saw how much affection and solicitude they showed for jane the apothecary came and having examined his patient said as might be supposed that she had caught a violent cold and that they must endeavour to get the better of it advised her to return to bed and promised her some draughts the advice was followed readily for the feverish symptoms increased and her head ached acutely elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment nor were the other ladies often absent the gentlemen being out they had in fact nothing to do elsewhere ,Pride and Prejudice
when the clock struck three elizabeth felt that she must go and very unwillingly said so miss bingley offered her the carriage and she only wanted a little pressing to accept it when jane testified such concern in parting with her that miss bingley was obliged to convert the offer of the chaise to an invitation to remain at netherfield for the present elizabeth most thankfully consented and a servant was dispatched to longbourn to acquaint the family with her stay and bring back a supply of clothes ,Pride and Prejudice
at five oclock the two ladies retired to dress and at halfpast six elizabeth was summoned to dinner to the civil enquiries which then poured in and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the much superior solicitude of mr bingleys she could not make a very favourable answer jane was by no means better the sisters on hearing this repeated three or four times how much they were grieved how shocking it was to have a bad cold and how excessively they disliked being ill themselves and then thought no more of the matter and their indifference towards jane when not immediately before them restored elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike ,Pride and Prejudice
their brother indeed was the only one of the party whom she could regard with any complacency his anxiety for jane was evident and his attentions to herself most pleasing and they prevented her feeling herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the others she had very little notice from any but him miss bingley was engrossed by mr darcy her sister scarcely less so and as for mr hurst by whom elizabeth sat he was an indolent man who lived only to eat drink and play at cards who when he found her prefer a plain dish to a ragout had nothing to say to her ,Pride and Prejudice
when dinner was over she returned directly to jane and miss bingley began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room her manners were pronounced to be very bad indeed a mixture of pride and impertinence she had no conversation no style no taste no beauty mrs hurst thought the same and added ,Pride and Prejudice
she did indeed louisa i could hardly keep my countenance very nonsensical to come at all why must she be scampering about the country because her sister had a cold her hair so untidy so blowsy ,Pride and Prejudice
your picture may be very exact louisa said bingley but this was all lost upon me i thought miss elizabeth bennet looked remarkably well when she came into the room this morning her dirty petticoat quite escaped my notice ,Pride and Prejudice
to walk three miles or four miles or five miles or whatever it is above her ankles in dirt and alone quite alone what could she mean by it it seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence a most countrytown indifference to decorum ,Pride and Prejudice
i have an excessive regard for miss jane bennet she is really a very sweet girl and i wish with all my heart she were well settled but with such a father and mother and such low connections i am afraid there is no chance of it ,Pride and Prejudice
with a renewal of tenderness however they repaired to her room on leaving the diningparlour and sat with her till summoned to coffee she was still very poorly and elizabeth would not quit her at all till late in the evening when she had the comfort of seeing her asleep and when it appeared to her rather right than pleasant that she should go downstairs herself on entering the drawingroom she found the whole party at loo and was immediately invited to join them but suspecting them to be playing high she declined it and making her sister the excuse said she would amuse herself for the short time she could stay below with a book mr hurst looked at her with astonishment ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was so much caught by what passed as to leave her very little attention for her book and soon laying it wholly aside she drew near the cardtable and stationed herself between mr bingley and his eldest sister to observe the game ,Pride and Prejudice
how i long to see her again i never met with anybody who delighted me so much such a countenance such mannersand so extremely accomplished for her age her performance on the pianoforte is exquisite ,Pride and Prejudice
yes all of them i think they all paint tables cover screens and net purses i scarcely know any one who cannot do all this and i am sure i never heard a young lady spoken of for the first time without being informed that she was very accomplished ,Pride and Prejudice
your list of the common extent of accomplishments said darcy has too much truth the word is applied to many a woman who deserves it no otherwise than by netting a purse or covering a screen but i am very far from agreeing with you in your estimation of ladies in general i cannot boast of knowing more than half a dozen in the whole range of my acquaintance that are really accomplished ,Pride and Prejudice
oh certainly cried his faithful assistant no one can be really esteemed accomplished who does not greatly surpass what is usually met with a woman must have a thorough knowledge of music singing drawing dancing and the modern languages to deserve the word and besides all this she must possess a certain something in her air and manner of walking the tone of her voice her address and expressions or the word will be but half deserved ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs hurst and miss bingley both cried out against the injustice of her implied doubt and were both protesting that they knew many women who answered this description when mr hurst called them to order with bitter complaints of their inattention to what was going forward as all conversation was thereby at an end elizabeth soon afterwards left the room ,Pride and Prejudice
eliza bennet said miss bingley when the door was closed on her is one of those young ladies who seek to recommend themselves to the other sex by undervaluing their own and with many men i dare say it succeeds but in my opinion it is a paltry device a very mean art ,Pride and Prejudice
undoubtedly replied darcy to whom this remark was chiefly addressed there is meanness in all the arts which ladies sometimes condescend to employ for captivation whatever bears affinity to cunning is despicable ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth joined them again only to say that her sister was worse and that she could not leave her bingley urged mr joness being sent for immediately while his sisters convinced that no country advice could be of any service recommended an express to town for one of the most eminent physicians this she would not hear of but she was not so unwilling to comply with their brothers proposal and it was settled that mr jones should be sent for early in the morning if miss bennet were not decidedly better bingley was quite uncomfortable his sisters declared that they were miserable they solaced their wretchedness however by duets after supper while he could find no better relief to his feelings than by giving his housekeeper directions that every possible attention might be paid to the sick lady and her sister ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth passed the chief of the night in her sisters room and in the morning had the pleasure of being able to send a tolerable answer to the enquiries which she very early received from mr bingley by a housemaid and some time afterwards from the two elegant ladies who waited on his sisters in spite of this amendment however she requested to have a note sent to longbourn desiring her mother to visit jane and form her own judgment of her situation the note was immediately dispatched and its contents as quickly complied with mrs bennet accompanied by her two youngest girls reached netherfield soon after the family breakfast ,Pride and Prejudice
had she found jane in any apparent danger mrs bennet would have been very miserable but being satisfied on seeing her that her illness was not alarming she had no wish of her recovering immediately as her restoration to health would probably remove her from netherfield she would not listen therefore to her daughters proposal of being carried home neither did the apothecary who arrived about the same time think it at all advisable after sitting a little while with jane on miss bingleys appearance and invitation the mother and three daughters all attended her into the breakfast parlour bingley met them with hopes that mrs bennet had not found miss bennet worse than she expected ,Pride and Prejudice
i am sure she added if it was not for such good friends i do not know what would become of her for she is very ill indeed and suffers a vast deal though with the greatest patience in the world which is always the way with her for she has without exception the sweetest temper i ever met with i often tell my other girls they are nothing to her you have a sweet room here mr bingley and a charming prospect over that gravel walk i do not know a place in the country that is equal to netherfield you will not think of quitting it in a hurry i hope though you have but a short lease ,Pride and Prejudice
whatever i do is done in a hurry replied he and therefore if i should resolve to quit netherfield i should probably be off in five minutes at present however i consider myself as quite fixed here ,Pride and Prejudice
indeed mama you are mistaken said elizabeth blushing for her mother you quite mistook mr darcy he only meant that there was not such a variety of people to be met with in the country as in town which you must acknowledge to be true ,Pride and Prejudice
certainly my dear nobody said there were but as to not meeting with many people in this neighbourhood i believe there are few neighbourhoods larger i know we dine with fourandtwenty families ,Pride and Prejudice
nothing but concern for elizabeth could enable bingley to keep his countenance his sister was less delicate and directed her eye towards mr darcy with a very expressive smile elizabeth for the sake of saying something that might turn her mothers thoughts now asked her if charlotte lucas had been at longbourn since her coming away ,Pride and Prejudice
yes she called yesterday with her father what an agreeable man sir william is mr bingleyis not he so much the man of fashion so genteel and so easy he has always something to say to everybody that is my idea of good breeding and those persons who fancy themselves very important and never open their mouths quite mistake the matter ,Pride and Prejudice
no she would go home i fancy she was wanted about the mincepies for my part mr bingley i always keep servants that can do their own work my daughters are brought up differently but everybody is to judge for themselves and the lucases are a very good sort of girls i assure you it is a pity they are not handsome not that i think charlotte so very plainbut then she is our particular friend ,Pride and Prejudice
oh dear yes but you must own she is very plain lady lucas herself has often said so and envied me janes beauty i do not like to boast of my own child but to be sure janeone does not often see anybody better looking it is what everybody says i do not trust my own partiality when she was only fifteen there was a gentleman at my brother gardiners in town so much in love with her that my sisterinlaw was sure he would make her an offer before we came away but however he did not perhaps he thought her too young however he wrote some verses on her and very pretty they were ,Pride and Prejudice
and so ended his affection said elizabeth impatiently there has been many a one i fancy overcome in the same way i wonder who first discovered the efficacy of poetry in driving away love ,Pride and Prejudice
of a fine stout healthy love it may everything nourishes what is strong already but if it be only a slight thin sort of inclination i am convinced that one good sonnet will starve it entirely away ,Pride and Prejudice
darcy only smiled and the general pause which ensued made elizabeth tremble lest her mother should be exposing herself again she longed to speak but could think of nothing to say and after a short silence mrs bennet began repeating her thanks to mr bingley for his kindness to jane with an apology for troubling him also with lizzy mr bingley was unaffectedly civil in his answer and forced his younger sister to be civil also and say what the occasion required she performed her part indeed without much graciousness but mrs bennet was satisfied and soon afterwards ordered her carriage upon this signal the youngest of her daughters put herself forward the two girls had been whispering to each other during the whole visit and the result of it was that the youngest should tax mr bingley with having promised on his first coming into the country to give a ball at netherfield ,Pride and Prejudice
lydia was a stout wellgrown girl of fifteen with a fine complexion and goodhumoured countenance a favourite with her mother whose affection had brought her into public at an early age she had high animal spirits and a sort of natural selfconsequence which the attentions of the officers to whom her uncles good dinners and her own easy manners recommended her had increased into assurance she was very equal therefore to address mr bingley on the subject of the ball and abruptly reminded him of his promise adding that it would be the most shameful thing in the world if he did not keep it his answer to this sudden attack was delightful to their mothers ear ,Pride and Prejudice
i am perfectly ready i assure you to keep my engagement and when your sister is recovered you shall if you please name the very day of the ball but you would not wish to be dancing while she is ill ,Pride and Prejudice
lydia declared herself satisfied oh yesit would be much better to wait till jane was well and by that time most likely captain carter would be at meryton again and when you have given your ball she added i shall insist on their giving one also i shall tell colonel forster it will be quite a shame if he does not ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet and her daughters then departed and elizabeth returned instantly to jane leaving her own and her relations behaviour to the remarks of the two ladies and mr darcy the latter of whom however could not be prevailed on to join in their censure of her in spite of all miss bingleys witticisms on fine eyes ,Pride and Prejudice
the day passed much as the day before had done mrs hurst and miss bingley had spent some hours of the morning with the invalid who continued though slowly to mend and in the evening elizabeth joined their party in the drawingroom the loo table however did not appear mr darcy was writing and miss bingley seated near him was watching the progress of his letter and repeatedly calling off his attention by messages to his sister mr hurst and mr bingley were at piquet and mrs hurst was observing their game ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth took up some needlework and was sufficiently amused in attending to what passed between darcy and his companion the perpetual commendations of the lady either on his handwriting or on the evenness of his lines or on the length of his letter with the perfect unconcern with which her praises were received formed a curious dialogue and was exactly in unison with her opinion of each ,Pride and Prejudice
tell your sister i am delighted to hear of her improvement on the harp and pray let her know that i am quite in raptures with her beautiful little design for a table and i think it infinitely superior to miss grantleys ,Pride and Prejudice
the indirect boast for you are really proud of your defects in writing because you consider them as proceeding from a rapidity of thought and carelessness of execution which if not estimable you think at least highly interesting the power of doing anything with quickness is always much prized by the possessor and often without any attention to the imperfection of the performance when you told mrs bennet this morning that if you ever resolved on quitting netherfield you should be gone in five minutes you meant it to be a sort of panegyric of compliment to yourselfand yet what is there so very laudable in a precipitance which must leave very necessary business undone and can be of no real advantage to yourself or any one else ,Pride and Prejudice
nay cried bingley this is too much to remember at night all the foolish things that were said in the morning and yet upon my honour i believed what i said of myself to be true and i believe it at this moment at least therefore i did not assume the character of needless precipitance merely to show off before the ladies ,Pride and Prejudice
i dare say you believed it but i am by no means convinced that you would be gone with such celerity your conduct would be quite as dependent on chance as that of any man i know and if as you were mounting your horse a friend were to say bingley you had better stay till next week you would probably do it you would probably not goand at another word might stay a month ,Pride and Prejudice
i am exceedingly gratified said bingley by your converting what my friend says into a compliment on the sweetness of my temper but i am afraid you are giving it a turn which that gentleman did by no means intend for he would certainly think the better of me if under such a circumstance i were to give a flat denial and ride off as fast as i could ,Pride and Prejudice
you expect me to account for opinions which you choose to call mine but which i have never acknowledged allowing the case however to stand according to your representation you must remember miss bennet that the friend who is supposed to desire his return to the house and the delay of his plan has merely desired it asked it without offering one argument in favour of its propriety ,Pride and Prejudice
you appear to me mr darcy to allow nothing for the influence of friendship and affection a regard for the requester would often make one readily yield to a request without waiting for arguments to reason one into it i am not particularly speaking of such a case as you have supposed about mr bingley we may as well wait perhaps till the circumstance occurs before we discuss the discretion of his behaviour thereupon but in general and ordinary cases between friend and friend where one of them is desired by the other to change a resolution of no very great moment should you think ill of that person for complying with the desire without waiting to be argued into it ,Pride and Prejudice
will it not be advisable before we proceed on this subject to arrange with rather more precision the degree of importance which is to appertain to this request as well as the degree of intimacy subsisting between the parties ,Pride and Prejudice
by all means cried bingley let us hear all the particulars not forgetting their comparative height and size for that will have more weight in the argument miss bennet than you may be aware of i assure you that if darcy were not such a great tall fellow in comparison with myself i should not pay him half so much deference i declare i do not know a more awful object than darcy on particular occasions and in particular places at his own house especially and of a sunday evening when he has nothing to do ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy smiled but elizabeth thought she could perceive that he was rather offended and therefore checked her laugh miss bingley warmly resented the indignity he had received in an expostulation with her brother for talking such nonsense ,Pride and Prejudice
when that business was over he applied to miss bingley and elizabeth for the indulgence of some music miss bingley moved with alacrity to the pianoforte and after a polite request that elizabeth would lead the way which the other as politely and more earnestly negatived she seated herself ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs hurst sang with her sister and while they were thus employed elizabeth could not help observing as she turned over some musicbooks that lay on the instrument how frequently mr darcys eyes were fixed on her she hardly knew how to suppose that she could be an object of admiration to so great a man and yet that he should look at her because he disliked her was still more strange she could only imagine however at last that she drew his notice because there was a something about her more wrong and reprehensible according to his ideas of right than in any other person present the supposition did not pain her she liked him too little to care for his approbation ,Pride and Prejudice
oh said she i heard you before but i could not immediately determine what to say in reply you wanted me i know to say yes that you might have the pleasure of despising my taste but i always delight in overthrowing those kind of schemes and cheating a person of their premeditated contempt i have therefore made up my mind to tell you that i do not want to dance a reel at alland now despise me if you dare ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth having rather expected to affront him was amazed at his gallantry but there was a mixture of sweetness and archness in her manner which made it difficult for her to affront anybody and darcy had never been so bewitched by any woman as he was by her he really believed that were it not for the inferiority of her connections he should be in some danger ,Pride and Prejudice
i hope said she as they were walking together in the shrubbery the next day you will give your motherinlaw a few hints when this desirable event takes place as to the advantage of holding her tongue and if you can compass it do cure the younger girls of running after the officers and if i may mention so delicate a subject endeavour to check that little something bordering on conceit and impertinence which your lady possesses ,Pride and Prejudice
oh yes do let the portraits of your uncle and aunt philips be placed in the gallery at pemberley put them next to your great uncle the judge they are in the same profession you know only in different lines as for your elizabeths picture you must not attempt to have it taken for what painter could do justice to those beautiful eyes ,Pride and Prejudice
she then ran gaily off rejoicing as she rambled about in the hope of being at home again in a day or two jane was already so much recovered as to intend leaving her room for a couple of hours that evening ,Pride and Prejudice
when the ladies removed after dinner elizabeth ran up to her sister and seeing her well guarded from cold attended her into the drawingroom where she was welcomed by her two friends with many professions of pleasure and elizabeth had never seen them so agreeable as they were during the hour which passed before the gentlemen appeared their powers of conversation were considerable they could describe an entertainment with accuracy relate an anecdote with humour and laugh at their acquaintance with spirit ,Pride and Prejudice
but when the gentlemen entered jane was no longer the first object miss bingleys eyes were instantly turned toward darcy and she had something to say to him before he had advanced many steps he addressed himself to miss bennet with a polite congratulation mr hurst also made her a slight bow and said he was very glad but diffuseness and warmth remained for bingleys salutation he was full of joy and attention the first halfhour was spent in piling up the fire lest she should suffer from the change of room and she removed at his desire to the other side of the fireplace that she might be further from the door he then sat down by her and talked scarcely to anyone else elizabeth at work in the opposite corner saw it all with great delight ,Pride and Prejudice
when tea was over mr hurst reminded his sisterinlaw of the cardtablebut in vain she had obtained private intelligence that mr darcy did not wish for cards and mr hurst soon found even his open petition rejected she assured him that no one intended to play and the silence of the whole party on the subject seemed to justify her mr hurst had therefore nothing to do but to stretch himself on one of the sofas and go to sleep darcy took up a book miss bingley did the same and mrs hurst principally occupied in playing with her bracelets and rings joined now and then in her brothers conversation with miss bennet ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bingleys attention was quite as much engaged in watching mr darcys progress through his book as in reading her own and she was perpetually either making some enquiry or looking at his page she could not win him however to any conversation he merely answered her question and read on at length quite exhausted by the attempt to be amused with her own book which she had only chosen because it was the second volume of his she gave a great yawn and said how pleasant it is to spend an evening in this way i declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading how much sooner one tires of anything than of a book when i have a house of my own i shall be miserable if i have not an excellent library ,Pride and Prejudice
no one made any reply she then yawned again threw aside her book and cast her eyes round the room in quest for some amusement when hearing her brother mentioning a ball to miss bennet she turned suddenly towards him and said ,Pride and Prejudice
by the bye charles are you really serious in meditating a dance at netherfield i would advise you before you determine on it to consult the wishes of the present party i am much mistaken if there are not some among us to whom a ball would be rather a punishment than a pleasure ,Pride and Prejudice
if you mean darcy cried her brother he may go to bed if he chooses before it beginsbut as for the ball it is quite a settled thing and as soon as nicholls has made white soup enough i shall send round my cards ,Pride and Prejudice
i should like balls infinitely better she replied if they were carried on in a different manner but there is something insufferably tedious in the usual process of such a meeting it would surely be much more rational if conversation instead of dancing were made the order of the day ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bingley made no answer and soon afterwards she got up and walked about the room her figure was elegant and she walked well but darcy at whom it was all aimed was still inflexibly studious in the desperation of her feelings she resolved on one effort more and turning to elizabeth said ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was surprised but agreed to it immediately miss bingley succeeded no less in the real object of her civility mr darcy looked up he was as much awake to the novelty of attention in that quarter as elizabeth herself could be and unconsciously closed his book he was directly invited to join their party but he declined it observing that he could imagine but two motives for their choosing to walk up and down the room together with either of which motives his joining them would interfere what could he mean she was dying to know what could be his meaningand asked elizabeth whether she could at all understand him ,Pride and Prejudice
i have not the smallest objection to explaining them said he as soon as she allowed him to speak you either choose this method of passing the evening because you are in each others confidence and have secret affairs to discuss or because you are conscious that your figures appear to the greatest advantage in walking if the first i would be completely in your way and if the second i can admire you much better as i sit by the fire ,Pride and Prejudice
nothing so easy if you have but the inclination said elizabeth we can all plague and punish one another tease himlaugh at him intimate as you are you must know how it is to be done ,Pride and Prejudice
but upon my honour i do not i do assure you that my intimacy has not yet taught me that tease calmness of manner and presence of mind no no i feel he may defy us there and as to laughter we will not expose ourselves if you please by attempting to laugh without a subject mr darcy may hug himself ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy is not to be laughed at cried elizabeth that is an uncommon advantage and uncommon i hope it will continue for it would be a great loss to me to have many such acquaintances i dearly love a laugh ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bingley said he has given me more credit than can be the wisest and the best of mennay the wisest and best of their actionsmay be rendered ridiculous by a person whose first object in life is a joke ,Pride and Prejudice
certainly replied elizabeththere are such people but i hope i am not one of them i hope i never ridicule what is wise and good follies and nonsense whims and inconsistencies do divert me i own and i laugh at them whenever i can but these i suppose are precisely what you are without ,Pride and Prejudice
no said darcy i have made no such pretension i have faults enough but they are not i hope of understanding my temper i dare not vouch for it is i believe too little yieldingcertainly too little for the convenience of the world i cannot forget the follies and vices of others so soon as i ought nor their offenses against myself my feelings are not puffed about with every attempt to move them my temper would perhaps be called resentful my good opinion once lost is lost forever ,Pride and Prejudice
her sister had not the smallest objection and the pianoforte was opened and darcy after a few moments recollection was not sorry for it he began to feel the danger of paying elizabeth too much attention ,Pride and Prejudice
in consequence of an agreement between the sisters elizabeth wrote the next morning to their mother to beg that the carriage might be sent for them in the course of the day but mrs bennet who had calculated on her daughters remaining at netherfield till the following tuesday which would exactly finish janes week could not bring herself to receive them with pleasure before her answer therefore was not propitious at least not to elizabeths wishes for she was impatient to get home mrs bennet sent them word that they could not possibly have the carriage before tuesday and in her postscript it was added that if mr bingley and his sister pressed them to stay longer she could spare them very well against staying longer however elizabeth was positively resolvednor did she much expect it would be asked and fearful on the contrary as being considered as intruding themselves needlessly long she urged jane to borrow mr bingleys carriage immediately and at length it was settled that their original design of leaving netherfield that morning should be mentioned and the request made ,Pride and Prejudice
the communication excited many professions of concern and enough was said of wishing them to stay at least till the following day to work on jane and till the morrow their going was deferred miss bingley was then sorry that she had proposed the delay for her jealousy and dislike of one sister much exceeded her affection for the other ,Pride and Prejudice
the master of the house heard with real sorrow that they were to go so soon and repeatedly tried to persuade miss bennet that it would not be safe for herthat she was not enough recovered but jane was firm where she felt herself to be right ,Pride and Prejudice
to mr darcy it was welcome intelligenceelizabeth had been at netherfield long enough she attracted him more than he likedand miss bingley was uncivil to her and more teasing than usual to himself he wisely resolved to be particularly careful that no sign of admiration should now escape him nothing that could elevate her with the hope of influencing his felicity sensible that if such an idea had been suggested his behaviour during the last day must have material weight in confirming or crushing it steady to his purpose he scarcely spoke ten words to her through the whole of saturday and though they were at one time left by themselves for halfanhour he adhered most conscientiously to his book and would not even look at her ,Pride and Prejudice
on sunday after morning service the separation so agreeable to almost all took place miss bingleys civility to elizabeth increased at last very rapidly as well as her affection for jane and when they parted after assuring the latter of the pleasure it would always give her to see her either at longbourn or netherfield and embracing her most tenderly she even shook hands with the former elizabeth took leave of the whole party in the liveliest of spirits ,Pride and Prejudice
they were not welcomed home very cordially by their mother mrs bennet wondered at their coming and thought them very wrong to give so much trouble and was sure jane would have caught cold again but their father though very laconic in his expressions of pleasure was really glad to see them he had felt their importance in the family circle the evening conversation when they were all assembled had lost much of its animation and almost all its sense by the absence of jane and elizabeth ,Pride and Prejudice
they found mary as usual deep in the study of thoroughbass and human nature and had some extracts to admire and some new observations of threadbare morality to listen to catherine and lydia had information for them of a different sort much had been done and much had been said in the regiment since the preceding wednesday several of the officers had dined lately with their uncle a private had been flogged and it had actually been hinted that colonel forster was going to be married ,Pride and Prejudice
i hope my dear said mr bennet to his wife as they were at breakfast the next morning that you have ordered a good dinner today because i have reason to expect an addition to our family party ,Pride and Prejudice
who do you mean my dear i know of nobody that is coming i am sure unless charlotte lucas should happen to call inand i hope my dinners are good enough for her i do not believe she often sees such at home ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennets eyes sparkled a gentleman and a stranger it is mr bingley i am sure well i am sure i shall be extremely glad to see mr bingley butgood lord how unlucky there is not a bit of fish to be got today lydia my love ring the belli must speak to hill this moment ,Pride and Prejudice
about a month ago i received this letter and about a fortnight ago i answered it for i thought it a case of some delicacy and requiring early attention it is from my cousin mr collins who when i am dead may turn you all out of this house as soon as he pleases ,Pride and Prejudice
oh my dear cried his wife i cannot bear to hear that mentioned pray do not talk of that odious man i do think it is the hardest thing in the world that your estate should be entailed away from your own children and i am sure if i had been you i should have tried long ago to do something or other about it ,Pride and Prejudice
jane and elizabeth tried to explain to her the nature of an entail they had often attempted to do it before but it was a subject on which mrs bennet was beyond the reach of reason and she continued to rail bitterly against the cruelty of settling an estate away from a family of five daughters in favour of a man whom nobody cared anything about ,Pride and Prejudice
it certainly is a most iniquitous affair said mr bennet and nothing can clear mr collins from the guilt of inheriting longbourn but if you will listen to his letter you may perhaps be a little softened by his manner of expressing himself ,Pride and Prejudice
no that i am sure i shall not and i think it is very impertinent of him to write to you at all and very hypocritical i hate such false friends why could he not keep on quarreling with you as his father did before him ,Pride and Prejudice
dear sir the disagreement subsisting between yourself and my late honoured father always gave me much uneasiness and since i have had the misfortune to lose him i have frequently wished to heal the breach but for some time i was kept back by my own doubts fearing lest it might seem disrespectful to his memory for me to be on good terms with anyone with whom it had always pleased him to be at variancethere mrs bennetmy mind however is now made up on the subject for having received ordination at easter i have been so fortunate as to be distinguished by the patronage of the right honourable lady catherine de bourgh widow of sir lewis de bourgh whose bounty and beneficence has preferred me to the valuable rectory of this parish where it shall be my earnest endeavour to demean myself with grateful respect towards her ladyship and be ever ready to perform those rites and ceremonies which are instituted by the church of england as a clergyman moreover i feel it my duty to promote and establish the blessing of peace in all families within the reach of my influence and on these grounds i flatter myself that my present overtures are highly commendable and that the circumstance of my being next in the entail of longbourn estate will be kindly overlooked on your side and not lead you to reject the offered olivebranch i cannot be otherwise than concerned at being the means of injuring your amiable daughters and beg leave to apologise for it as well as to assure you of my readiness to make them every possible amendsbut of this hereafter if you should have no objection to receive me into your house i propose myself the satisfaction of waiting on you and your family monday november th by four oclock and shall probably trespass on your hospitality till the saturday seennight following which i can do without any inconvenience as lady catherine is far from objecting to my occasional absence on a sunday provided that some other clergyman is engaged to do the duty of the dayi remain dear sir with respectful compliments to your lady and daughters your wellwisher and friend ,Pride and Prejudice
at four oclock therefore we may expect this peacemaking gentleman said mr bennet as he folded up the letter he seems to be a most conscientious and polite young man upon my word and i doubt not will prove a valuable acquaintance especially if lady catherine should be so indulgent as to let him come to us again ,Pride and Prejudice
he must be an oddity i think said she i cannot make him outthere is something very pompous in his styleand what can he mean by apologising for being next in the entailwe cannot suppose he would help it if he couldcould he be a sensible man sir ,Pride and Prejudice
no my dear i think not i have great hopes of finding him quite the reverse there is a mixture of servility and selfimportance in his letter which promises well i am impatient to see him ,Pride and Prejudice
to catherine and lydia neither the letter nor its writer were in any degree interesting it was next to impossible that their cousin should come in a scarlet coat and it was now some weeks since they had received pleasure from the society of a man in any other colour as for their mother mr collinss letter had done away much of her illwill and she was preparing to see him with a degree of composure which astonished her husband and daughters ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins was punctual to his time and was received with great politeness by the whole family mr bennet indeed said little but the ladies were ready enough to talk and mr collins seemed neither in need of encouragement nor inclined to be silent himself he was a tall heavylooking young man of fiveandtwenty his air was grave and stately and his manners were very formal he had not been long seated before he complimented mrs bennet on having so fine a family of daughters said he had heard much of their beauty but that in this instance fame had fallen short of the truth and added that he did not doubt her seeing them all in due time disposed of in marriage this gallantry was not much to the taste of some of his hearers but mrs bennet who quarreled with no compliments answered most readily ,Pride and Prejudice
ah sir i do indeed it is a grievous affair to my poor girls you must confess not that i mean to find fault with you for such things i know are all chance in this world there is no knowing how estates will go when once they come to be entailed ,Pride and Prejudice
i am very sensible madam of the hardship to my fair cousins and could say much on the subject but that i am cautious of appearing forward and precipitate but i can assure the young ladies that i come prepared to admire them at present i will not say more but perhaps when we are better acquainted ,Pride and Prejudice
he was interrupted by a summons to dinner and the girls smiled on each other they were not the only objects of mr collinss admiration the hall the diningroom and all its furniture were examined and praised and his commendation of everything would have touched mrs bennets heart but for the mortifying supposition of his viewing it all as his own future property the dinner too in its turn was highly admired and he begged to know to which of his fair cousins the excellency of its cooking was owing but he was set right there by mrs bennet who assured him with some asperity that they were very well able to keep a good cook and that her daughters had nothing to do in the kitchen he begged pardon for having displeased her in a softened tone she declared herself not at all offended but he continued to apologise for about a quarter of an hour ,Pride and Prejudice
during dinner mr bennet scarcely spoke at all but when the servants were withdrawn he thought it time to have some conversation with his guest and therefore started a subject in which he expected him to shine by observing that he seemed very fortunate in his patroness lady catherine de bourghs attention to his wishes and consideration for his comfort appeared very remarkable mr bennet could not have chosen better mr collins was eloquent in her praise the subject elevated him to more than usual solemnity of manner and with a most important aspect he protested that he had never in his life witnessed such behaviour in a person of ranksuch affability and condescension as he had himself experienced from lady catherine she had been graciously pleased to approve of both of the discourses which he had already had the honour of preaching before her she had also asked him twice to dine at rosings and had sent for him only the saturday before to make up her pool of quadrille in the evening lady catherine was reckoned proud by many people he knew but he had never seen anything but affability in her she had always spoken to him as she would to any other gentleman she made not the smallest objection to his joining in the society of the neighbourhood nor to his leaving the parish occasionally for a week or two to visit his relations she had even condescended to advise him to marry as soon as he could provided he chose with discretion and had once paid him a visit in his humble parsonage where she had perfectly approved all the alterations he had been making and had even vouchsafed to suggest some herselfsome shelves in the closet up stairs ,Pride and Prejudice
that is all very proper and civil i am sure said mrs bennet and i dare say she is a very agreeable woman it is a pity that great ladies in general are not more like her does she live near you sir ,Pride and Prejudice
she is a most charming young lady indeed lady catherine herself says that in point of true beauty miss de bourgh is far superior to the handsomest of her sex because there is that in her features which marks the young lady of distinguished birth she is unfortunately of a sickly constitution which has prevented her from making that progress in many accomplishments which she could not have otherwise failed of as i am informed by the lady who superintended her education and who still resides with them but she is perfectly amiable and often condescends to drive by my humble abode in her little phaeton and ponies ,Pride and Prejudice
her indifferent state of health unhappily prevents her being in town and by that means as i told lady catherine one day has deprived the british court of its brightest ornament her ladyship seemed pleased with the idea and you may imagine that i am happy on every occasion to offer those little delicate compliments which are always acceptable to ladies i have more than once observed to lady catherine that her charming daughter seemed born to be a duchess and that the most elevated rank instead of giving her consequence would be adorned by her these are the kind of little things which please her ladyship and it is a sort of attention which i conceive myself peculiarly bound to pay ,Pride and Prejudice
you judge very properly said mr bennet and it is happy for you that you possess the talent of flattering with delicacy may i ask whether these pleasing attentions proceed from the impulse of the moment or are the result of previous study ,Pride and Prejudice
they arise chiefly from what is passing at the time and though i sometimes amuse myself with suggesting and arranging such little elegant compliments as may be adapted to ordinary occasions i always wish to give them as unstudied an air as possible ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennets expectations were fully answered his cousin was as absurd as he had hoped and he listened to him with the keenest enjoyment maintaining at the same time the most resolute composure of countenance and except in an occasional glance at elizabeth requiring no partner in his pleasure ,Pride and Prejudice
by teatime however the dose had been enough and mr bennet was glad to take his guest into the drawingroom again and when tea was over glad to invite him to read aloud to the ladies mr collins readily assented and a book was produced but on beholding it for everything announced it to be from a circulating library he started back and begging pardon protested that he never read novels kitty stared at him and lydia exclaimed other books were produced and after some deliberation he chose fordyces sermons lydia gaped as he opened the volume and before he had with very monotonous solemnity read three pages she interrupted him with ,Pride and Prejudice
do you know mamma that my uncle phillips talks of turning away richard and if he does colonel forster will hire him my aunt told me so herself on saturday i shall walk to meryton tomorrow to hear more about it and to ask when mr denny comes back from town ,Pride and Prejudice
i have often observed how little young ladies are interested by books of a serious stamp though written solely for their benefit it amazes me i confess for certainly there can be nothing so advantageous to them as instruction but i will no longer importune my young cousin ,Pride and Prejudice
then turning to mr bennet he offered himself as his antagonist at backgammon mr bennet accepted the challenge observing that he acted very wisely in leaving the girls to their own trifling amusements mrs bennet and her daughters apologised most civilly for lydias interruption and promised that it should not occur again if he would resume his book but mr collins after assuring them that he bore his young cousin no illwill and should never resent her behaviour as any affront seated himself at another table with mr bennet and prepared for backgammon ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins was not a sensible man and the deficiency of nature had been but little assisted by education or society the greatest part of his life having been spent under the guidance of an illiterate and miserly father and though he belonged to one of the universities he had merely kept the necessary terms without forming at it any useful acquaintance the subjection in which his father had brought him up had given him originally great humility of manner but it was now a good deal counteracted by the selfconceit of a weak head living in retirement and the consequential feelings of early and unexpected prosperity a fortunate chance had recommended him to lady catherine de bourgh when the living of hunsford was vacant and the respect which he felt for her high rank and his veneration for her as his patroness mingling with a very good opinion of himself of his authority as a clergyman and his right as a rector made him altogether a mixture of pride and obsequiousness selfimportance and humility ,Pride and Prejudice
having now a good house and a very sufficient income he intended to marry and in seeking a reconciliation with the longbourn family he had a wife in view as he meant to choose one of the daughters if he found them as handsome and amiable as they were represented by common report this was his plan of amendsof atonementfor inheriting their fathers estate and he thought it an excellent one full of eligibility and suitableness and excessively generous and disinterested on his own part ,Pride and Prejudice
his plan did not vary on seeing them miss bennets lovely face confirmed his views and established all his strictest notions of what was due to seniority and for the first evening she was his settled choice the next morning however made an alteration for in a quarter of an hours ttette with mrs bennet before breakfast a conversation beginning with his parsonagehouse and leading naturally to the avowal of his hopes that a mistress might be found for it at longbourn produced from her amid very complaisant smiles and general encouragement a caution against the very jane he had fixed on as to her younger daughters she could not take upon her to sayshe could not positively answerbut she did not know of any prepossession her eldest daughter she must just mentionshe felt it incumbent on her to hint was likely to be very soon engaged ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins had only to change from jane to elizabethand it was soon donedone while mrs bennet was stirring the fire elizabeth equally next to jane in birth and beauty succeeded her of course ,Pride and Prejudice
lydias intention of walking to meryton was not forgotten every sister except mary agreed to go with her and mr collins was to attend them at the request of mr bennet who was most anxious to get rid of him and have his library to himself for thither mr collins had followed him after breakfast and there he would continue nominally engaged with one of the largest folios in the collection but really talking to mr bennet with little cessation of his house and garden at hunsford such doings discomposed mr bennet exceedingly in his library he had been always sure of leisure and tranquillity and though prepared as he told elizabeth to meet with folly and conceit in every other room of the house he was used to be free from them there his civility therefore was most prompt in inviting mr collins to join his daughters in their walk and mr collins being in fact much better fitted for a walker than a reader was extremely pleased to close his large book and go ,Pride and Prejudice
in pompous nothings on his side and civil assents on that of his cousins their time passed till they entered meryton the attention of the younger ones was then no longer to be gained by him their eyes were immediately wandering up in the street in quest of the officers and nothing less than a very smart bonnet indeed or a really new muslin in a shop window could recall them ,Pride and Prejudice
but the attention of every lady was soon caught by a young man whom they had never seen before of most gentlemanlike appearance walking with another officer on the other side of the way the officer was the very mr denny concerning whose return from london lydia came to enquire and he bowed as they passed all were struck with the strangers air all wondered who he could be and kitty and lydia determined if possible to find out led the way across the street under pretense of wanting something in an opposite shop and fortunately had just gained the pavement when the two gentlemen turning back had reached the same spot mr denny addressed them directly and entreated permission to introduce his friend mr wickham who had returned with him the day before from town and he was happy to say had accepted a commission in their corps this was exactly as it should be for the young man wanted only regimentals to make him completely charming his appearance was greatly in his favour he had all the best part of beauty a fine countenance a good figure and very pleasing address the introduction was followed up on his side by a happy readiness of conversationa readiness at the same time perfectly correct and unassuming and the whole party were still standing and talking together very agreeably when the sound of horses drew their notice and darcy and bingley were seen riding down the street on distinguishing the ladies of the group the two gentlemen came directly towards them and began the usual civilities bingley was the principal spokesman and miss bennet the principal object he was then he said on his way to longbourn on purpose to enquire after her mr darcy corroborated it with a bow and was beginning to determine not to fix his eyes on elizabeth when they were suddenly arrested by the sight of the stranger and elizabeth happening to see the countenance of both as they looked at each other was all astonishment at the effect of the meeting both changed colour one looked white the other red mr wickham after a few moments touched his hata salutation which mr darcy just deigned to return what could be the meaning of it it was impossible to imagine it was impossible not to long to know ,Pride and Prejudice
mr denny and mr wickham walked with the young ladies to the door of mr phillips house and then made their bows in spite of miss lydias pressing entreaties that they should come in and even in spite of mrs phillipss throwing up the parlour window and loudly seconding the invitation ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs phillips was always glad to see her nieces and the two eldest from their recent absence were particularly welcome and she was eagerly expressing her surprise at their sudden return home which as their own carriage had not fetched them she should have known nothing about if she had not happened to see mr joness shopboy in the street who had told her that they were not to send any more draughts to netherfield because the miss bennets were come away when her civility was claimed towards mr collins by janes introduction of him she received him with her very best politeness which he returned with as much more apologising for his intrusion without any previous acquaintance with her which he could not help flattering himself however might be justified by his relationship to the young ladies who introduced him to her notice mrs phillips was quite awed by such an excess of good breeding but her contemplation of one stranger was soon put to an end by exclamations and enquiries about the other of whom however she could only tell her nieces what they already knew that mr denny had brought him from london and that he was to have a lieutenants commission in the shire she had been watching him the last hour she said as he walked up and down the street and had mr wickham appeared kitty and lydia would certainly have continued the occupation but unluckily no one passed windows now except a few of the officers who in comparison with the stranger were become stupid disagreeable fellows some of them were to dine with the phillipses the next day and their aunt promised to make her husband call on mr wickham and give him an invitation also if the family from longbourn would come in the evening this was agreed to and mrs phillips protested that they would have a nice comfortable noisy game of lottery tickets and a little bit of hot supper afterwards the prospect of such delights was very cheering and they parted in mutual good spirits mr collins repeated his apologies in quitting the room and was assured with unwearying civility that they were perfectly needless ,Pride and Prejudice
as they walked home elizabeth related to jane what she had seen pass between the two gentlemen but though jane would have defended either or both had they appeared to be in the wrong she could no more explain such behaviour than her sister ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins on his return highly gratified mrs bennet by admiring mrs phillipss manners and politeness he protested that except lady catherine and her daughter he had never seen a more elegant woman for she had not only received him with the utmost civility but even pointedly included him in her invitation for the next evening although utterly unknown to her before something he supposed might be attributed to his connection with them but yet he had never met with so much attention in the whole course of his life ,Pride and Prejudice
as no objection was made to the young peoples engagement with their aunt and all mr collinss scruples of leaving mr and mrs bennet for a single evening during his visit were most steadily resisted the coach conveyed him and his five cousins at a suitable hour to meryton and the girls had the pleasure of hearing as they entered the drawingroom that mr wickham had accepted their uncles invitation and was then in the house ,Pride and Prejudice
when this information was given and they had all taken their seats mr collins was at leisure to look around him and admire and he was so much struck with the size and furniture of the apartment that he declared he might almost have supposed himself in the small summer breakfast parlour at rosings a comparison that did not at first convey much gratification but when mrs phillips understood from him what rosings was and who was its proprietorwhen she had listened to the description of only one of lady catherines drawingrooms and found that the chimneypiece alone had cost eight hundred pounds she felt all the force of the compliment and would hardly have resented a comparison with the housekeepers room ,Pride and Prejudice
in describing to her all the grandeur of lady catherine and her mansion with occasional digressions in praise of his own humble abode and the improvements it was receiving he was happily employed until the gentlemen joined them and he found in mrs phillips a very attentive listener whose opinion of his consequence increased with what she heard and who was resolving to retail it all among her neighbours as soon as she could to the girls who could not listen to their cousin and who had nothing to do but to wish for an instrument and examine their own indifferent imitations of china on the mantelpiece the interval of waiting appeared very long it was over at last however the gentlemen did approach and when mr wickham walked into the room elizabeth felt that she had neither been seeing him before nor thinking of him since with the smallest degree of unreasonable admiration the officers of the shire were in general a very creditable gentlemanlike set and the best of them were of the present party but mr wickham was as far beyond them all in person countenance air and walk as they were superior to the broadfaced stuffy uncle phillips breathing port wine who followed them into the room ,Pride and Prejudice
mr wickham was the happy man towards whom almost every female eye was turned and elizabeth was the happy woman by whom he finally seated himself and the agreeable manner in which he immediately fell into conversation though it was only on its being a wet night made her feel that the commonest dullest most threadbare topic might be rendered interesting by the skill of the speaker ,Pride and Prejudice
with such rivals for the notice of the fair as mr wickham and the officers mr collins seemed to sink into insignificance to the young ladies he certainly was nothing but he had still at intervals a kind listener in mrs phillips and was by her watchfulness most abundantly supplied with coffee and muffin when the cardtables were placed he had the opportunity of obliging her in turn by sitting down to whist ,Pride and Prejudice
i know little of the game at present said he but i shall be glad to improve myself for in my situation in life mrs phillips was very glad for his compliance but could not wait for his reason ,Pride and Prejudice
mr wickham did not play at whist and with ready delight was he received at the other table between elizabeth and lydia at first there seemed danger of lydias engrossing him entirely for she was a most determined talker but being likewise extremely fond of lottery tickets she soon grew too much interested in the game too eager in making bets and exclaiming after prizes to have attention for anyone in particular allowing for the common demands of the game mr wickham was therefore at leisure to talk to elizabeth and she was very willing to hear him though what she chiefly wished to hear she could not hope to be toldthe history of his acquaintance with mr darcy she dared not even mention that gentleman her curiosity however was unexpectedly relieved mr wickham began the subject himself he enquired how far netherfield was from meryton and after receiving her answer asked in a hesitating manner how long mr darcy had been staying there ,Pride and Prejudice
yes replied mr wickham his estate there is a noble one a clear ten thousand per annum you could not have met with a person more capable of giving you certain information on that head than myself for i have been connected with his family in a particular manner from my infancy ,Pride and Prejudice
i have no right to give my opinion said wickham as to his being agreeable or otherwise i am not qualified to form one i have known him too long and too well to be a fair judge it is impossible for me to be impartial but i believe your opinion of him would in general astonishand perhaps you would not express it quite so strongly anywhere else here you are in your own family ,Pride and Prejudice
upon my word i say no more here than i might say in any house in the neighbourhood except netherfield he is not at all liked in hertfordshire everybody is disgusted with his pride you will not find him more favourably spoken of by anyone ,Pride and Prejudice
i cannot pretend to be sorry said wickham after a short interruption that he or that any man should not be estimated beyond their deserts but with him i believe it does not often happen the world is blinded by his fortune and consequence or frightened by his high and imposing manners and sees him only as he chooses to be seen ,Pride and Prejudice
oh noit is not for me to be driven away by mr darcy if he wishes to avoid seeing me he must go we are not on friendly terms and it always gives me pain to meet him but i have no reason for avoiding him but what i might proclaim before all the world a sense of very great illusage and most painful regrets at his being what he is his father miss bennet the late mr darcy was one of the best men that ever breathed and the truest friend i ever had and i can never be in company with this mr darcy without being grieved to the soul by a thousand tender recollections his behaviour to myself has been scandalous but i verily believe i could forgive him anything and everything rather than his disappointing the hopes and disgracing the memory of his father ,Pride and Prejudice
mr wickham began to speak on more general topics meryton the neighbourhood the society appearing highly pleased with all that he had yet seen and speaking of the latter with gentle but very intelligible gallantry ,Pride and Prejudice
it was the prospect of constant society and good society he added which was my chief inducement to enter the shire i knew it to be a most respectable agreeable corps and my friend denny tempted me further by his account of their present quarters and the very great attentions and excellent acquaintances meryton had procured them society i own is necessary to me i have been a disappointed man and my spirits will not bear solitude i must have employment and society a military life is not what i was intended for but circumstances have now made it eligible the church ought to have been my professioni was brought up for the church and i should at this time have been in possession of a most valuable living had it pleased the gentleman we were speaking of just now ,Pride and Prejudice
yesthe late mr darcy bequeathed me the next presentation of the best living in his gift he was my godfather and excessively attached to me i cannot do justice to his kindness he meant to provide for me amply and thought he had done it but when the living fell it was given elsewhere ,Pride and Prejudice
there was just such an informality in the terms of the bequest as to give me no hope from law a man of honour could not have doubted the intention but mr darcy chose to doubt itor to treat it as a merely conditional recommendation and to assert that i had forfeited all claim to it by extravagance imprudencein short anything or nothing certain it is that the living became vacant two years ago exactly as i was of an age to hold it and that it was given to another man and no less certain is it that i cannot accuse myself of having really done anything to deserve to lose it i have a warm unguarded temper and i may have spoken my opinion of him and to him too freely i can recall nothing worse but the fact is that we are very different sort of men and that he hates me ,Pride and Prejudice
a thorough determined dislike of mea dislike which i cannot but attribute in some measure to jealousy had the late mr darcy liked me less his son might have borne with me better but his fathers uncommon attachment to me irritated him i believe very early in life he had not a temper to bear the sort of competition in which we stoodthe sort of preference which was often given me ,Pride and Prejudice
i had not thought mr darcy so bad as thisthough i have never liked him i had not thought so very ill of him i had supposed him to be despising his fellowcreatures in general but did not suspect him of descending to such malicious revenge such injustice such inhumanity as this ,Pride and Prejudice
after a few minutes reflection however she continued i do remember his boasting one day at netherfield of the implacability of his resentments of his having an unforgiving temper his disposition must be dreadful ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was again deep in thought and after a time exclaimed to treat in such a manner the godson the friend the favourite of his father she could have added a young man too like you whose very countenance may vouch for your being amiablebut she contented herself with and one too who had probably been his companion from childhood connected together as i think you said in the closest manner ,Pride and Prejudice
we were born in the same parish within the same park the greatest part of our youth was passed together inmates of the same house sharing the same amusements objects of the same parental care my father began life in the profession which your uncle mr phillips appears to do so much credit tobut he gave up everything to be of use to the late mr darcy and devoted all his time to the care of the pemberley property he was most highly esteemed by mr darcy a most intimate confidential friend mr darcy often acknowledged himself to be under the greatest obligations to my fathers active superintendence and when immediately before my fathers death mr darcy gave him a voluntary promise of providing for me i am convinced that he felt it to be as much a debt of gratitude to him as of his affection to myself ,Pride and Prejudice
how strange cried elizabeth how abominable i wonder that the very pride of this mr darcy has not made him just to you if from no better motive that he should not have been too proud to be dishonestfor dishonesty i must call it ,Pride and Prejudice
it is wonderful replied wickham for almost all his actions may be traced to pride and pride had often been his best friend it has connected him nearer with virtue than with any other feeling but we are none of us consistent and in his behaviour to me there were stronger impulses even than pride ,Pride and Prejudice
yes it has often led him to be liberal and generous to give his money freely to display hospitality to assist his tenants and relieve the poor family pride and filial pridefor he is very proud of what his father washave done this not to appear to disgrace his family to degenerate from the popular qualities or lose the influence of the pemberley house is a powerful motive he has also brotherly pride which with some brotherly affection makes him a very kind and careful guardian of his sister and you will hear him generally cried up as the most attentive and best of brothers ,Pride and Prejudice
he shook his head i wish i could call her amiable it gives me pain to speak ill of a darcy but she is too much like her brothervery very proud as a child she was affectionate and pleasing and extremely fond of me and i have devoted hours and hours to her amusement but she is nothing to me now she is a handsome girl about fifteen or sixteen and i understand highly accomplished since her fathers death her home has been london where a lady lives with her and superintends her education ,Pride and Prejudice
i am astonished at his intimacy with mr bingley how can mr bingley who seems good humour itself and is i really believe truly amiable be in friendship with such a man how can they suit each other do you know mr bingley ,Pride and Prejudice
probably not but mr darcy can please where he chooses he does not want abilities he can be a conversible companion if he thinks it worth his while among those who are at all his equals in consequence he is a very different man from what he is to the less prosperous his pride never deserts him but with the rich he is liberalminded just sincere rational honourable and perhaps agreeableallowing something for fortune and figure ,Pride and Prejudice
the whist party soon afterwards breaking up the players gathered round the other table and mr collins took his station between his cousin elizabeth and mrs phillips the usual enquiries as to his success were made by the latter it had not been very great he had lost every point but when mrs phillips began to express her concern thereupon he assured her with much earnest gravity that it was not of the least importance that he considered the money as a mere trifle and begged that she would not make herself uneasy ,Pride and Prejudice
i know very well madam said he that when persons sit down to a cardtable they must take their chances of these things and happily i am not in such circumstances as to make five shillings any object there are undoubtedly many who could not say the same but thanks to lady catherine de bourgh i am removed far beyond the necessity of regarding little matters ,Pride and Prejudice
mr wickhams attention was caught and after observing mr collins for a few moments he asked elizabeth in a low voice whether her relation was very intimately acquainted with the family of de bourgh ,Pride and Prejudice
this information made elizabeth smile as she thought of poor miss bingley vain indeed must be all her attentions vain and useless her affection for his sister and her praise of himself if he were already selfdestined for another ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins said she speaks highly both of lady catherine and her daughter but from some particulars that he has related of her ladyship i suspect his gratitude misleads him and that in spite of her being his patroness she is an arrogant conceited woman ,Pride and Prejudice
i believe her to be both in a great degree replied wickham i have not seen her for many years but i very well remember that i never liked her and that her manners were dictatorial and insolent she has the reputation of being remarkably sensible and clever but i rather believe she derives part of her abilities from her rank and fortune part from her authoritative manner and the rest from the pride of her nephew who chooses that everyone connected with him should have an understanding of the first class ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth allowed that he had given a very rational account of it and they continued talking together with mutual satisfaction till supper put an end to cards and gave the rest of the ladies their share of mr wickhams attentions there could be no conversation in the noise of mrs phillipss supper party but his manners recommended him to everybody whatever he said was said well and whatever he did done gracefully elizabeth went away with her head full of him she could think of nothing but of mr wickham and of what he had told her all the way home but there was not time for her even to mention his name as they went for neither lydia nor mr collins were once silent lydia talked incessantly of lottery tickets of the fish she had lost and the fish she had won and mr collins in describing the civility of mr and mrs phillips protesting that he did not in the least regard his losses at whist enumerating all the dishes at supper and repeatedly fearing that he crowded his cousins had more to say than he could well manage before the carriage stopped at longbourn house ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth related to jane the next day what had passed between mr wickham and herself jane listened with astonishment and concern she knew not how to believe that mr darcy could be so unworthy of mr bingleys regard and yet it was not in her nature to question the veracity of a young man of such amiable appearance as wickham the possibility of his having endured such unkindness was enough to interest all her tender feelings and nothing remained therefore to be done but to think well of them both to defend the conduct of each and throw into the account of accident or mistake whatever could not be otherwise explained ,Pride and Prejudice
they have both said she been deceived i dare say in some way or other of which we can form no idea interested people have perhaps misrepresented each to the other it is in short impossible for us to conjecture the causes or circumstances which may have alienated them without actual blame on either side ,Pride and Prejudice
very true indeed and now my dear jane what have you got to say on behalf of the interested people who have probably been concerned in the business do clear them too or we shall be obliged to think ill of somebody ,Pride and Prejudice
laugh as much as you choose but you will not laugh me out of my opinion my dearest lizzy do but consider in what a disgraceful light it places mr darcy to be treating his fathers favourite in such a manner one whom his father had promised to provide for it is impossible no man of common humanity no man who had any value for his character could be capable of it can his most intimate friends be so excessively deceived in him oh no ,Pride and Prejudice
i can much more easily believe mr bingleys being imposed on than that mr wickham should invent such a history of himself as he gave me last night names facts everything mentioned without ceremony if it be not so let mr darcy contradict it besides there was truth in his looks ,Pride and Prejudice
the two young ladies were summoned from the shrubbery where this conversation passed by the arrival of the very persons of whom they had been speaking mr bingley and his sisters came to give their personal invitation for the longexpected ball at netherfield which was fixed for the following tuesday the two ladies were delighted to see their dear friend again called it an age since they had met and repeatedly asked what she had been doing with herself since their separation to the rest of the family they paid little attention avoiding mrs bennet as much as possible saying not much to elizabeth and nothing at all to the others they were soon gone again rising from their seats with an activity which took their brother by surprise and hurrying off as if eager to escape from mrs bennets civilities ,Pride and Prejudice
the prospect of the netherfield ball was extremely agreeable to every female of the family mrs bennet chose to consider it as given in compliment to her eldest daughter and was particularly flattered by receiving the invitation from mr bingley himself instead of a ceremonious card jane pictured to herself a happy evening in the society of her two friends and the attentions of their brother and elizabeth thought with pleasure of dancing a great deal with mr wickham and of seeing a confirmation of everything in mr darcys look and behaviour the happiness anticipated by catherine and lydia depended less on any single event or any particular person for though they each like elizabeth meant to dance half the evening with mr wickham he was by no means the only partner who could satisfy them and a ball was at any rate a ball and even mary could assure her family that she had no disinclination for it ,Pride and Prejudice
while i can have my mornings to myself said she it is enoughi think it is no sacrifice to join occasionally in evening engagements society has claims on us all and i profess myself one of those who consider intervals of recreation and amusement as desirable for everybody ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths spirits were so high on this occasion that though she did not often speak unnecessarily to mr collins she could not help asking him whether he intended to accept mr bingleys invitation and if he did whether he would think it proper to join in the evenings amusement and she was rather surprised to find that he entertained no scruple whatever on that head and was very far from dreading a rebuke either from the archbishop or lady catherine de bourgh by venturing to dance ,Pride and Prejudice
i am by no means of the opinion i assure you said he that a ball of this kind given by a young man of character to respectable people can have any evil tendency and i am so far from objecting to dancing myself that i shall hope to be honoured with the hands of all my fair cousins in the course of the evening and i take this opportunity of soliciting yours miss elizabeth for the two first dances especially a preference which i trust my cousin jane will attribute to the right cause and not to any disrespect for her ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth felt herself completely taken in she had fully proposed being engaged by mr wickham for those very dances and to have mr collins instead her liveliness had never been worse timed there was no help for it however mr wickhams happiness and her own were perforce delayed a little longer and mr collinss proposal accepted with as good a grace as she could she was not the better pleased with his gallantry from the idea it suggested of something more it now first struck her that she was selected from among her sisters as worthy of being mistress of hunsford parsonage and of assisting to form a quadrille table at rosings in the absence of more eligible visitors the idea soon reached to conviction as she observed his increasing civilities toward herself and heard his frequent attempt at a compliment on her wit and vivacity and though more astonished than gratified herself by this effect of her charms it was not long before her mother gave her to understand that the probability of their marriage was extremely agreeable to her elizabeth however did not choose to take the hint being well aware that a serious dispute must be the consequence of any reply mr collins might never make the offer and till he did it was useless to quarrel about him ,Pride and Prejudice
if there had not been a netherfield ball to prepare for and talk of the younger miss bennets would have been in a very pitiable state at this time for from the day of the invitation to the day of the ball there was such a succession of rain as prevented their walking to meryton once no aunt no officers no news could be sought afterthe very shoeroses for netherfield were got by proxy even elizabeth might have found some trial of her patience in weather which totally suspended the improvement of her acquaintance with mr wickham and nothing less than a dance on tuesday could have made such a friday saturday sunday and monday endurable to kitty and lydia ,Pride and Prejudice
till elizabeth entered the drawingroom at netherfield and looked in vain for mr wickham among the cluster of red coats there assembled a doubt of his being present had never occurred to her the certainty of meeting him had not been checked by any of those recollections that might not unreasonably have alarmed her she had dressed with more than usual care and prepared in the highest spirits for the conquest of all that remained unsubdued of his heart trusting that it was not more than might be won in the course of the evening but in an instant arose the dreadful suspicion of his being purposely omitted for mr darcys pleasure in the bingleys invitation to the officers and though this was not exactly the case the absolute fact of his absence was pronounced by his friend denny to whom lydia eagerly applied and who told them that wickham had been obliged to go to town on business the day before and was not yet returned adding with a significant smile i do not imagine his business would have called him away just now if he had not wanted to avoid a certain gentleman here ,Pride and Prejudice
this part of his intelligence though unheard by lydia was caught by elizabeth and as it assured her that darcy was not less answerable for wickhams absence than if her first surmise had been just every feeling of displeasure against the former was so sharpened by immediate disappointment that she could hardly reply with tolerable civility to the polite enquiries which he directly afterwards approached to make attendance forbearance patience with darcy was injury to wickham she was resolved against any sort of conversation with him and turned away with a degree of illhumour which she could not wholly surmount even in speaking to mr bingley whose blind partiality provoked her ,Pride and Prejudice
but elizabeth was not formed for illhumour and though every prospect of her own was destroyed for the evening it could not dwell long on her spirits and having told all her griefs to charlotte lucas whom she had not seen for a week she was soon able to make a voluntary transition to the oddities of her cousin and to point him out to her particular notice the first two dances however brought a return of distress they were dances of mortification mr collins awkward and solemn apologising instead of attending and often moving wrong without being aware of it gave her all the shame and misery which a disagreeable partner for a couple of dances can give the moment of her release from him was ecstasy ,Pride and Prejudice
she danced next with an officer and had the refreshment of talking of wickham and of hearing that he was universally liked when those dances were over she returned to charlotte lucas and was in conversation with her when she found herself suddenly addressed by mr darcy who took her so much by surprise in his application for her hand that without knowing what she did she accepted him he walked away again immediately and she was left to fret over her own want of presence of mind charlotte tried to console her ,Pride and Prejudice
when the dancing recommenced however and darcy approached to claim her hand charlotte could not help cautioning her in a whisper not to be a simpleton and allow her fancy for wickham to make her appear unpleasant in the eyes of a man ten times his consequence elizabeth made no answer and took her place in the set amazed at the dignity to which she was arrived in being allowed to stand opposite to mr darcy and reading in her neighbours looks their equal amazement in beholding it they stood for some time without speaking a word and she began to imagine that their silence was to last through the two dances and at first was resolved not to break it till suddenly fancying that it would be the greater punishment to her partner to oblige him to talk she made some slight observation on the dance he replied and was again silent after a pause of some minutes she addressed him a second time withit is your turn to say something now mr darcy i talked about the dance and you ought to make some sort of remark on the size of the room or the number of couples ,Pride and Prejudice
sometimes one must speak a little you know it would look odd to be entirely silent for half an hour together and yet for the advantage of some conversation ought to be so arranged as that they may have the trouble of saying as little as possible ,Pride and Prejudice
both replied elizabeth archly for i have always seen a great similarity in the turn of our minds we are each of an unsocial taciturn disposition unwilling to speak unless we expect to say something that will amaze the whole room and be handed down to posterity with all the clat of a proverb ,Pride and Prejudice
he made no answer and they were again silent till they had gone down the dance when he asked her if she and her sisters did not very often walk to meryton she answered in the affirmative and unable to resist the temptation added when you met us there the other day we had just been forming a new acquaintance ,Pride and Prejudice
the effect was immediate a deeper shade of hauteur overspread his features but he said not a word and elizabeth though blaming herself for her own weakness could not go on at length darcy spoke and in a constrained manner said mr wickham is blessed with such happy manners as may ensure his making friendswhether he may be equally capable of retaining them is less certain ,Pride and Prejudice
darcy made no answer and seemed desirous of changing the subject at that moment sir william lucas appeared close to them meaning to pass through the set to the other side of the room but on perceiving mr darcy he stopped with a bow of superior courtesy to compliment him on his dancing and his partner ,Pride and Prejudice
i have been most highly gratified indeed my dear sir such very superior dancing is not often seen it is evident that you belong to the first circles allow me to say however that your fair partner does not disgrace you and that i must hope to have this pleasure often repeated especially when a certain desirable event my dear eliza glancing at her sister and bingley shall take place what congratulations will then flow in i appeal to mr darcybut let me not interrupt you sir you will not thank me for detaining you from the bewitching converse of that young lady whose bright eyes are also upbraiding me ,Pride and Prejudice
the latter part of this address was scarcely heard by darcy but sir williams allusion to his friend seemed to strike him forcibly and his eyes were directed with a very serious expression towards bingley and jane who were dancing together recovering himself however shortly he turned to his partner and said sir williams interruption has made me forget what we were talking of ,Pride and Prejudice
i do not think we were speaking at all sir william could not have interrupted two people in the room who had less to say for themselves we have tried two or three subjects already without success and what we are to talk of next i cannot imagine ,Pride and Prejudice
yes always she replied without knowing what she said for her thoughts had wandered far from the subject as soon afterwards appeared by her suddenly exclaiming i remember hearing you once say mr darcy that you hardly ever forgave that your resentment once created was unappeasable you are very cautious i suppose as to its being created ,Pride and Prejudice
i can readily believe answered he gravely that reports may vary greatly with respect to me and i could wish miss bennet that you were not to sketch my character at the present moment as there is reason to fear that the performance would reflect no credit on either ,Pride and Prejudice
i would by no means suspend any pleasure of yours he coldly replied she said no more and they went down the other dance and parted in silence and on each side dissatisfied though not to an equal degree for in darcys breast there was a tolerably powerful feeling towards her which soon procured her pardon and directed all his anger against another ,Pride and Prejudice
so miss eliza i hear you are quite delighted with george wickham your sister has been talking to me about him and asking me a thousand questions and i find that the young man quite forgot to tell you among his other communication that he was the son of old wickham the late mr darcys steward let me recommend you however as a friend not to give implicit confidence to all his assertions for as to mr darcys using him ill it is perfectly false for on the contrary he has always been remarkably kind to him though george wickham has treated mr darcy in a most infamous manner i do not know the particulars but i know very well that mr darcy is not in the least to blame that he cannot bear to hear george wickham mentioned and that though my brother thought that he could not well avoid including him in his invitation to the officers he was excessively glad to find that he had taken himself out of the way his coming into the country at all is a most insolent thing indeed and i wonder how he could presume to do it i pity you miss eliza for this discovery of your favourites guilt but really considering his descent one could not expect much better ,Pride and Prejudice
his guilt and his descent appear by your account to be the same said elizabeth angrily for i have heard you accuse him of nothing worse than of being the son of mr darcys steward and of that i can assure you he informed me himself ,Pride and Prejudice
insolent girl said elizabeth to herself you are much mistaken if you expect to influence me by such a paltry attack as this i see nothing in it but your own wilful ignorance and the malice of mr darcy she then sought her eldest sister who had undertaken to make enquiries on the same subject of bingley jane met her with a smile of such sweet complacency a glow of such happy expression as sufficiently marked how well she was satisfied with the occurrences of the evening elizabeth instantly read her feelings and at that moment solicitude for wickham resentment against his enemies and everything else gave way before the hope of janes being in the fairest way for happiness ,Pride and Prejudice
i want to know said she with a countenance no less smiling than her sisters what you have learnt about mr wickham but perhaps you have been too pleasantly engaged to think of any third person in which case you may be sure of my pardon ,Pride and Prejudice
no replied jane i have not forgotten him but i have nothing satisfactory to tell you mr bingley does not know the whole of his history and is quite ignorant of the circumstances which have principally offended mr darcy but he will vouch for the good conduct the probity and honour of his friend and is perfectly convinced that mr wickham has deserved much less attention from mr darcy than he has received and i am sorry to say by his account as well as his sisters mr wickham is by no means a respectable young man i am afraid he has been very imprudent and has deserved to lose mr darcys regard ,Pride and Prejudice
i have not a doubt of mr bingleys sincerity said elizabeth warmly but you must excuse my not being convinced by assurances only mr bingleys defense of his friend was a very able one i dare say but since he is unacquainted with several parts of the story and has learnt the rest from that friend himself i shall venture to still think of both gentlemen as i did before ,Pride and Prejudice
she then changed the discourse to one more gratifying to each and on which there could be no difference of sentiment elizabeth listened with delight to the happy though modest hopes which jane entertained of mr bingleys regard and said all in her power to heighten her confidence in it on their being joined by mr bingley himself elizabeth withdrew to miss lucas to whose enquiry after the pleasantness of her last partner she had scarcely replied before mr collins came up to them and told her with great exultation that he had just been so fortunate as to make a most important discovery ,Pride and Prejudice
i have found out said he by a singular accident that there is now in the room a near relation of my patroness i happened to overhear the gentleman himself mentioning to the young lady who does the honours of the house the names of his cousin miss de bourgh and of her mother lady catherine how wonderfully these sort of things occur who would have thought of my meeting with perhaps a nephew of lady catherine de bourgh in this assembly i am most thankful that the discovery is made in time for me to pay my respects to him which i am now going to do and trust he will excuse my not having done it before my total ignorance of the connection must plead my apology ,Pride and Prejudice
indeed i am i shall entreat his pardon for not having done it earlier i believe him to be lady catherines nephew it will be in my power to assure him that her ladyship was quite well yesterday sennight ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth tried hard to dissuade him from such a scheme assuring him that mr darcy would consider his addressing him without introduction as an impertinent freedom rather than a compliment to his aunt that it was not in the least necessary there should be any notice on either side and that if it were it must belong to mr darcy the superior in consequence to begin the acquaintance mr collins listened to her with the determined air of following his own inclination and when she ceased speaking replied thus ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear miss elizabeth i have the highest opinion in the world in your excellent judgement in all matters within the scope of your understanding but permit me to say that there must be a wide difference between the established forms of ceremony amongst the laity and those which regulate the clergy for give me leave to observe that i consider the clerical office as equal in point of dignity with the highest rank in the kingdomprovided that a proper humility of behaviour is at the same time maintained you must therefore allow me to follow the dictates of my conscience on this occasion which leads me to perform what i look on as a point of duty pardon me for neglecting to profit by your advice which on every other subject shall be my constant guide though in the case before us i consider myself more fitted by education and habitual study to decide on what is right than a young lady like yourself and with a low bow he left her to attack mr darcy whose reception of his advances she eagerly watched and whose astonishment at being so addressed was very evident her cousin prefaced his speech with a solemn bow and though she could not hear a word of it she felt as if hearing it all and saw in the motion of his lips the words apology hunsford and lady catherine de bourgh it vexed her to see him expose himself to such a man mr darcy was eyeing him with unrestrained wonder and when at last mr collins allowed him time to speak replied with an air of distant civility mr collins however was not discouraged from speaking again and mr darcys contempt seemed abundantly increasing with the length of his second speech and at the end of it he only made him a slight bow and moved another way mr collins then returned to elizabeth ,Pride and Prejudice
i have no reason i assure you said he to be dissatisfied with my reception mr darcy seemed much pleased with the attention he answered me with the utmost civility and even paid me the compliment of saying that he was so well convinced of lady catherines discernment as to be certain she could never bestow a favour unworthily it was really a very handsome thought upon the whole i am much pleased with him ,Pride and Prejudice
as elizabeth had no longer any interest of her own to pursue she turned her attention almost entirely on her sister and mr bingley and the train of agreeable reflections which her observations gave birth to made her perhaps almost as happy as jane she saw her in idea settled in that very house in all the felicity which a marriage of true affection could bestow and she felt capable under such circumstances of endeavouring even to like bingleys two sisters her mothers thoughts she plainly saw were bent the same way and she determined not to venture near her lest she might hear too much when they sat down to supper therefore she considered it a most unlucky perverseness which placed them within one of each other and deeply was she vexed to find that her mother was talking to that one person lady lucas freely openly and of nothing else but her expectation that jane would soon be married to mr bingley it was an animating subject and mrs bennet seemed incapable of fatigue while enumerating the advantages of the match his being such a charming young man and so rich and living but three miles from them were the first points of selfgratulation and then it was such a comfort to think how fond the two sisters were of jane and to be certain that they must desire the connection as much as she could do it was moreover such a promising thing for her younger daughters as janes marrying so greatly must throw them in the way of other rich men and lastly it was so pleasant at her time of life to be able to consign her single daughters to the care of their sister that she might not be obliged to go into company more than she liked it was necessary to make this circumstance a matter of pleasure because on such occasions it is the etiquette but no one was less likely than mrs bennet to find comfort in staying home at any period of her life she concluded with many good wishes that lady lucas might soon be equally fortunate though evidently and triumphantly believing there was no chance of it ,Pride and Prejudice
in vain did elizabeth endeavour to check the rapidity of her mothers words or persuade her to describe her felicity in a less audible whisper for to her inexpressible vexation she could perceive that the chief of it was overheard by mr darcy who sat opposite to them her mother only scolded her for being nonsensical ,Pride and Prejudice
nothing that she could say however had any influence her mother would talk of her views in the same intelligible tone elizabeth blushed and blushed again with shame and vexation she could not help frequently glancing her eye at mr darcy though every glance convinced her of what she dreaded for though he was not always looking at her mother she was convinced that his attention was invariably fixed by her the expression of his face changed gradually from indignant contempt to a composed and steady gravity ,Pride and Prejudice
at length however mrs bennet had no more to say and lady lucas who had been long yawning at the repetition of delights which she saw no likelihood of sharing was left to the comforts of cold ham and chicken elizabeth now began to revive but not long was the interval of tranquillity for when supper was over singing was talked of and she had the mortification of seeing mary after very little entreaty preparing to oblige the company by many significant looks and silent entreaties did she endeavour to prevent such a proof of complaisance but in vain mary would not understand them such an opportunity of exhibiting was delightful to her and she began her song elizabeths eyes were fixed on her with most painful sensations and she watched her progress through the several stanzas with an impatience which was very ill rewarded at their close for mary on receiving amongst the thanks of the table the hint of a hope that she might be prevailed on to favour them again after the pause of half a minute began another marys powers were by no means fitted for such a display her voice was weak and her manner affected elizabeth was in agonies she looked at jane to see how she bore it but jane was very composedly talking to bingley she looked at his two sisters and saw them making signs of derision at each other and at darcy who continued however imperturbably grave she looked at her father to entreat his interference lest mary should be singing all night he took the hint and when mary had finished her second song said aloud that will do extremely well child you have delighted us long enough let the other young ladies have time to exhibit ,Pride and Prejudice
mary though pretending not to hear was somewhat disconcerted and elizabeth sorry for her and sorry for her fathers speech was afraid her anxiety had done no good others of the party were now applied to ,Pride and Prejudice
if i said mr collins were so fortunate as to be able to sing i should have great pleasure i am sure in obliging the company with an air for i consider music as a very innocent diversion and perfectly compatible with the profession of a clergyman i do not mean however to assert that we can be justified in devoting too much of our time to music for there are certainly other things to be attended to the rector of a parish has much to do in the first place he must make such an agreement for tithes as may be beneficial to himself and not offensive to his patron he must write his own sermons and the time that remains will not be too much for his parish duties and the care and improvement of his dwelling which he cannot be excused from making as comfortable as possible and i do not think it of light importance that he should have attentive and conciliatory manners towards everybody especially towards those to whom he owes his preferment i cannot acquit him of that duty nor could i think well of the man who should omit an occasion of testifying his respect towards anybody connected with the family and with a bow to mr darcy he concluded his speech which had been spoken so loud as to be heard by half the room many staredmany smiled but no one looked more amused than mr bennet himself while his wife seriously commended mr collins for having spoken so sensibly and observed in a halfwhisper to lady lucas that he was a remarkably clever good kind of young man ,Pride and Prejudice
to elizabeth it appeared that had her family made an agreement to expose themselves as much as they could during the evening it would have been impossible for them to play their parts with more spirit or finer success and happy did she think it for bingley and her sister that some of the exhibition had escaped his notice and that his feelings were not of a sort to be much distressed by the folly which he must have witnessed that his two sisters and mr darcy however should have such an opportunity of ridiculing her relations was bad enough and she could not determine whether the silent contempt of the gentleman or the insolent smiles of the ladies were more intolerable ,Pride and Prejudice
the rest of the evening brought her little amusement she was teased by mr collins who continued most perseveringly by her side and though he could not prevail on her to dance with him again put it out of her power to dance with others in vain did she entreat him to stand up with somebody else and offer to introduce him to any young lady in the room he assured her that as to dancing he was perfectly indifferent to it that his chief object was by delicate attentions to recommend himself to her and that he should therefore make a point of remaining close to her the whole evening there was no arguing upon such a project she owed her greatest relief to her friend miss lucas who often joined them and goodnaturedly engaged mr collinss conversation to herself ,Pride and Prejudice
she was at least free from the offense of mr darcys further notice though often standing within a very short distance of her quite disengaged he never came near enough to speak she felt it to be the probable consequence of her allusions to mr wickham and rejoiced in it ,Pride and Prejudice
the longbourn party were the last of all the company to depart and by a manoeuvre of mrs bennet had to wait for their carriage a quarter of an hour after everybody else was gone which gave them time to see how heartily they were wished away by some of the family mrs hurst and her sister scarcely opened their mouths except to complain of fatigue and were evidently impatient to have the house to themselves they repulsed every attempt of mrs bennet at conversation and by so doing threw a languor over the whole party which was very little relieved by the long speeches of mr collins who was complimenting mr bingley and his sisters on the elegance of their entertainment and the hospitality and politeness which had marked their behaviour to their guests darcy said nothing at all mr bennet in equal silence was enjoying the scene mr bingley and jane were standing together a little detached from the rest and talked only to each other elizabeth preserved as steady a silence as either mrs hurst or miss bingley and even lydia was too much fatigued to utter more than the occasional exclamation of lord how tired i am accompanied by a violent yawn ,Pride and Prejudice
when at length they arose to take leave mrs bennet was most pressingly civil in her hope of seeing the whole family soon at longbourn and addressed herself especially to mr bingley to assure him how happy he would make them by eating a family dinner with them at any time without the ceremony of a formal invitation bingley was all grateful pleasure and he readily engaged for taking the earliest opportunity of waiting on her after his return from london whither he was obliged to go the next day for a short time ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet was perfectly satisfied and quitted the house under the delightful persuasion that allowing for the necessary preparations of settlements new carriages and wedding clothes she should undoubtedly see her daughter settled at netherfield in the course of three or four months of having another daughter married to mr collins she thought with equal certainty and with considerable though not equal pleasure elizabeth was the least dear to her of all her children and though the man and the match were quite good enough for her the worth of each was eclipsed by mr bingley and netherfield ,Pride and Prejudice
the next day opened a new scene at longbourn mr collins made his declaration in form having resolved to do it without loss of time as his leave of absence extended only to the following saturday and having no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the moment he set about it in a very orderly manner with all the observances which he supposed a regular part of the business on finding mrs bennet elizabeth and one of the younger girls together soon after breakfast he addressed the mother in these words ,Pride and Prejudice
before elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise mrs bennet answered instantly oh dearyescertainly i am sure lizzy will be very happyi am sure she can have no objection come kitty i want you up stairs and gathering her work together she was hastening away when elizabeth called out ,Pride and Prejudice
no no nonsense lizzy i desire you to stay where you are and upon elizabeths seeming really with vexed and embarrassed looks about to escape she added lizzy i insist upon your staying and hearing mr collins ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth would not oppose such an injunctionand a moments consideration making her also sensible that it would be wisest to get it over as soon and as quietly as possible she sat down again and tried to conceal by incessant employment the feelings which were divided between distress and diversion mrs bennet and kitty walked off and as soon as they were gone mr collins began ,Pride and Prejudice
believe me my dear miss elizabeth that your modesty so far from doing you any disservice rather adds to your other perfections you would have been less amiable in my eyes had there not been this little unwillingness but allow me to assure you that i have your respected mothers permission for this address you can hardly doubt the purport of my discourse however your natural delicacy may lead you to dissemble my attentions have been too marked to be mistaken almost as soon as i entered the house i singled you out as the companion of my future life but before i am run away with by my feelings on this subject perhaps it would be advisable for me to state my reasons for marryingand moreover for coming into hertfordshire with the design of selecting a wife as i certainly did ,Pride and Prejudice
the idea of mr collins with all his solemn composure being run away with by his feelings made elizabeth so near laughing that she could not use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him further and he continued ,Pride and Prejudice
my reasons for marrying are first that i think it a right thing for every clergyman in easy circumstances like myself to set the example of matrimony in his parish secondly that i am convinced that it will add very greatly to my happiness and thirdlywhich perhaps i ought to have mentioned earlier that it is the particular advice and recommendation of the very noble lady whom i have the honour of calling patroness twice has she condescended to give me her opinion unasked too on this subject and it was but the very saturday night before i left hunsfordbetween our pools at quadrille while mrs jenkinson was arranging miss de bourghs footstool that she said mr collins you must marry a clergyman like you must marry choose properly choose a gentlewoman for my sake and for your own let her be an active useful sort of person not brought up high but able to make a small income go a good way this is my advice find such a woman as soon as you can bring her to hunsford and i will visit her allow me by the way to observe my fair cousin that i do not reckon the notice and kindness of lady catherine de bourgh as among the least of the advantages in my power to offer you will find her manners beyond anything i can describe and your wit and vivacity i think must be acceptable to her especially when tempered with the silence and respect which her rank will inevitably excite thus much for my general intention in favour of matrimony it remains to be told why my views were directed towards longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood where i can assure you there are many amiable young women but the fact is that being as i am to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured father who however may live many years longer i could not satisfy myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters that the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy event takes placewhich however as i have already said may not be for several years this has been my motive my fair cousin and i flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem and now nothing remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the violence of my affection to fortune i am perfectly indifferent and shall make no demand of that nature on your father since i am well aware that it could not be complied with and that one thousand pounds in the four per cents which will not be yours till after your mothers decease is all that you may ever be entitled to on that head therefore i shall be uniformly silent and you may assure yourself that no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married ,Pride and Prejudice
you are too hasty sir she cried you forget that i have made no answer let me do it without further loss of time accept my thanks for the compliment you are paying me i am very sensible of the honour of your proposals but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than to decline them ,Pride and Prejudice
i am not now to learn replied mr collins with a formal wave of the hand that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the man whom they secretly mean to accept when he first applies for their favour and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a third time i am therefore by no means discouraged by what you have just said and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long ,Pride and Prejudice
upon my word sir cried elizabeth your hope is a rather extraordinary one after my declaration i do assure you that i am not one of those young ladies if such young ladies there are who are so daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second time i am perfectly serious in my refusal you could not make me happy and i am convinced that i am the last woman in the world who could make you so nay were your friend lady catherine to know me i am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the situation ,Pride and Prejudice
were it certain that lady catherine would think so said mr collins very gravelybut i cannot imagine that her ladyship would at all disapprove of you and you may be certain when i have the honour of seeing her again i shall speak in the very highest terms of your modesty economy and other amiable qualification ,Pride and Prejudice
indeed mr collins all praise of me will be unnecessary you must give me leave to judge for myself and pay me the compliment of believing what i say i wish you very happy and very rich and by refusing your hand do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise in making me the offer you must have satisfied the delicacy of your feelings with regard to my family and may take possession of longbourn estate whenever it falls without any selfreproach this matter may be considered therefore as finally settled and rising as she thus spoke she would have quitted the room had mr collins not thus addressed her ,Pride and Prejudice
when i do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject i shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given me though i am far from accusing you of cruelty at present because i know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the first application and perhaps you have even now said as much to encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the female character ,Pride and Prejudice
really mr collins cried elizabeth with some warmth you puzzle me exceedingly if what i have hitherto said can appear to you in the form of encouragement i know not how to express my refusal in such a way as to convince you of its being one ,Pride and Prejudice
you must give me leave to flatter myself my dear cousin that your refusal of my addresses is merely words of course my reasons for believing it are briefly these it does not appear to me that my hand is unworthy of your acceptance or that the establishment i can offer would be any other than highly desirable my situation in life my connections with the family of de bourgh and my relationship to your own are circumstances highly in my favour and you should take it into further consideration that in spite of your manifold attractions it is by no means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you your portion is unhappily so small that it will in all likelihood undo the effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications as i must therefore conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me i shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by suspense according to the usual practice of elegant females ,Pride and Prejudice
i do assure you sir that i have no pretensions whatever to that kind of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man i would rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere i thank you again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals but to accept them is absolutely impossible my feelings in every respect forbid it can i speak plainer do not consider me now as an elegant female intending to plague you but as a rational creature speaking the truth from her heart ,Pride and Prejudice
you are uniformly charming cried he with an air of awkward gallantry and i am persuaded that when sanctioned by the express authority of both your excellent parents my proposals will not fail of being acceptable ,Pride and Prejudice
to such perseverance in wilful selfdeception elizabeth would make no reply and immediately and in silence withdrew determined if he persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering encouragement to apply to her father whose negative might be uttered in such a manner as to be decisive and whose behaviour at least could not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his successful love for mrs bennet having dawdled about in the vestibule to watch for the end of the conference no sooner saw elizabeth open the door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase than she entered the breakfastroom and congratulated both him and herself in warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection mr collins received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure and then proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview with the result of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied since the refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character ,Pride and Prejudice
this information however startled mrs bennet she would have been glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage him by protesting against his proposals but she dared not believe it and could not help saying so ,Pride and Prejudice
but depend upon it mr collins she added that lizzy shall be brought to reason i will speak to her about it directly she is a very headstrong foolish girl and does not know her own interest but i will make her know it ,Pride and Prejudice
pardon me for interrupting you madam cried mr collins but if she is really headstrong and foolish i know not whether she would altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation who naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state if therefore she actually persists in rejecting my suit perhaps it were better not to force her into accepting me because if liable to such defects of temper she could not contribute much to my felicity ,Pride and Prejudice
sir you quite misunderstand me said mrs bennet alarmed lizzy is only headstrong in such matters as these in everything else she is as goodnatured a girl as ever lived i will go directly to mr bennet and we shall very soon settle it with her i am sure ,Pride and Prejudice
she would not give him time to reply but hurrying instantly to her husband called out as she entered the library oh mr bennet you are wanted immediately we are all in an uproar you must come and make lizzy marry mr collins for she vows she will not have him and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and not have her ,Pride and Prejudice
come here child cried her father as she appeared i have sent for you on an affair of importance i understand that mr collins has made you an offer of marriage is it true elizabeth replied that it was very welland this offer of marriage you have refused ,Pride and Prejudice
an unhappy alternative is before you elizabeth from this day you must be a stranger to one of your parents your mother will never see you again if you do not marry mr collins and i will never see you again if you do ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning but mrs bennet who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the affair as she wished was excessively disappointed ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear replied her husband i have two small favours to request first that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the present occasion and secondly of my room i shall be glad to have the library to myself as soon as may be ,Pride and Prejudice
not yet however in spite of her disappointment in her husband did mrs bennet give up the point she talked to elizabeth again and again coaxed and threatened her by turns she endeavoured to secure jane in her interest but jane with all possible mildness declined interfering and elizabeth sometimes with real earnestness and sometimes with playful gaiety replied to her attacks though her manner varied however her determination never did ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins meanwhile was meditating in solitude on what had passed he thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motives his cousin could refuse him and though his pride was hurt he suffered in no other way his regard for her was quite imaginary and the possibility of her deserving her mothers reproach prevented his feeling any regret ,Pride and Prejudice
while the family were in this confusion charlotte lucas came to spend the day with them she was met in the vestibule by lydia who flying to her cried in a half whisper i am glad you are come for there is such fun here what do you think has happened this morning mr collins has made an offer to lizzy and she will not have him ,Pride and Prejudice
charlotte hardly had time to answer before they were joined by kitty who came to tell the same news and no sooner had they entered the breakfastroom where mrs bennet was alone than she likewise began on the subject calling on miss lucas for her compassion and entreating her to persuade her friend lizzy to comply with the wishes of all her family pray do my dear miss lucas she added in a melancholy tone for nobody is on my side nobody takes part with me i am cruelly used nobody feels for my poor nerves ,Pride and Prejudice
aye there she comes continued mrs bennet looking as unconcerned as may be and caring no more for us than if we were at york provided she can have her own way but i tell you miss lizzyif you take it into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way you will never get a husband at alland i am sure i do not know who is to maintain you when your father is dead i shall not be able to keep youand so i warn you i have done with you from this very day i told you in the library you know that i should never speak to you again and you will find me as good as my word i have no pleasure in talking to undutiful children not that i have much pleasure indeed in talking to anybody people who suffer as i do from nervous complaints can have no great inclination for talking nobody can tell what i suffer but it is always so those who do not complain are never pitied ,Pride and Prejudice
her daughters listened in silence to this effusion sensible that any attempt to reason with her or soothe her would only increase the irritation she talked on therefore without interruption from any of them till they were joined by mr collins who entered the room with an air more stately than usual and on perceiving whom she said to the girls now i do insist upon it that you all of you hold your tongues and let me and mr collins have a little conversation together ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth passed quietly out of the room jane and kitty followed but lydia stood her ground determined to hear all she could and charlotte detained first by the civility of mr collins whose enquiries after herself and all her family were very minute and then by a little curiosity satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending not to hear in a doleful voice mrs bennet began the projected conversation oh mr collins ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear madam replied he let us be for ever silent on this point far be it from me he presently continued in a voice that marked his displeasure to resent the behaviour of your daughter resignation to inevitable evils is the duty of us all the peculiar duty of a young man who has been so fortunate as i have been in early preferment and i trust i am resigned perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand for i have often observed that resignation is never so perfect as when the blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation you will not i hope consider me as showing any disrespect to your family my dear madam by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your daughters favour without having paid yourself and mr bennet the compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf my conduct may i fear be objectionable in having accepted my dismission from your daughters lips instead of your own but we are all liable to error i have certainly meant well through the whole affair my object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself with due consideration for the advantage of all your family and if my manner has been at all reprehensible i here beg leave to apologise ,Pride and Prejudice
the discussion of mr collinss offer was now nearly at an end and elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily attending it and occasionally from some peevish allusions of her mother as for the gentleman himself his feelings were chiefly expressed not by embarrassment or dejection or by trying to avoid her but by stiffness of manner and resentful silence he scarcely ever spoke to her and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of himself were transferred for the rest of the day to miss lucas whose civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all and especially to her friend ,Pride and Prejudice
the morrow produced no abatement of mrs bennets illhumour or ill health mr collins was also in the same state of angry pride elizabeth had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit but his plan did not appear in the least affected by it he was always to have gone on saturday and to saturday he meant to stay ,Pride and Prejudice
after breakfast the girls walked to meryton to enquire if mr wickham were returned and to lament over his absence from the netherfield ball he joined them on their entering the town and attended them to their aunts where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody was well talked over to elizabeth however he voluntarily acknowledged that the necessity of his absence had been selfimposed ,Pride and Prejudice
i found said he as the time drew near that i had better not meet mr darcy that to be in the same room the same party with him for so many hours together might be more than i could bear and that scenes might arise unpleasant to more than myself ,Pride and Prejudice
she highly approved his forbearance and they had leisure for a full discussion of it and for all the commendation which they civilly bestowed on each other as wickham and another officer walked back with them to longbourn and during the walk he particularly attended to her his accompanying them was a double advantage she felt all the compliment it offered to herself and it was most acceptable as an occasion of introducing him to her father and mother ,Pride and Prejudice
soon after their return a letter was delivered to miss bennet it came from netherfield the envelope contained a sheet of elegant little hotpressed paper well covered with a ladys fair flowing hand and elizabeth saw her sisters countenance change as she read it and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages jane recollected herself soon and putting the letter away tried to join with her usual cheerfulness in the general conversation but elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention even from wickham and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave than a glance from jane invited her to follow her up stairs when they had gained their own room jane taking out the letter said ,Pride and Prejudice
this is from caroline bingley what it contains has surprised me a good deal the whole party have left netherfield by this time and are on their way to townand without any intention of coming back again you shall hear what she says ,Pride and Prejudice
she then read the first sentence aloud which comprised the information of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly and of their meaning to dine in grosvenor street where mr hurst had a house the next was in these words i do not pretend to regret anything i shall leave in hertfordshire except your society my dearest friend but we will hope at some future period to enjoy many returns of that delightful intercourse we have known and in the meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most unreserved correspondence i depend on you for that to these highflown expressions elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of distrust and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her she saw nothing in it really to lament it was not to be supposed that their absence from netherfield would prevent mr bingleys being there and as to the loss of their society she was persuaded that jane must cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his ,Pride and Prejudice
it is unlucky said she after a short pause that you should not be able to see your friends before they leave the country but may we not hope that the period of future happiness to which miss bingley looks forward may arrive earlier than she is aware and that the delightful intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater satisfaction as sisters mr bingley will not be detained in london by them ,Pride and Prejudice
when my brother left us yesterday he imagined that the business which took him to london might be concluded in three or four days but as we are certain it cannot be so and at the same time convinced that when charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again we have determined on following him thither that he may not be obliged to spend his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel many of my acquaintances are already there for the winter i wish that i could hear that you my dearest friend had any intention of making one of the crowdbut of that i despair i sincerely hope your christmas in hertfordshire may abound in the gaieties which that season generally brings and that your beaux will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of whom we shall deprive you ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy is impatient to see his sister and to confess the truth we are scarcely less eager to meet her again i really do not think georgiana darcy has her equal for beauty elegance and accomplishments and the affection she inspires in louisa and myself is heightened into something still more interesting from the hope we dare entertain of her being hereafter our sister i do not know whether i ever before mentioned to you my feelings on this subject but i will not leave the country without confiding them and i trust you will not esteem them unreasonable my brother admires her greatly already he will have frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing her relations all wish the connection as much as his own and a sisters partiality is not misleading me i think when i call charles most capable of engaging any womans heart with all these circumstances to favour an attachment and nothing to prevent it am i wrong my dearest jane in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness of so many ,Pride and Prejudice
what do you think of this sentence my dear lizzy said jane as she finished it is it not clear enough does it not expressly declare that caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister that she is perfectly convinced of her brothers indifference and that if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means most kindly to put me on my guard can there be any other opinion on the subject ,Pride and Prejudice
you shall have it in a few words miss bingley sees that her brother is in love with you and wants him to marry miss darcy she follows him to town in hope of keeping him there and tries to persuade you that he does not care about you ,Pride and Prejudice
indeed jane you ought to believe me no one who has ever seen you together can doubt his affection miss bingley i am sure cannot she is not such a simpleton could she have seen half as much love in mr darcy for herself she would have ordered her wedding clothes but the case is this we are not rich enough or grand enough for them and she is the more anxious to get miss darcy for her brother from the notion that when there has been one intermarriage she may have less trouble in achieving a second in which there is certainly some ingenuity and i dare say it would succeed if miss de bourgh were out of the way but my dearest jane you cannot seriously imagine that because miss bingley tells you her brother greatly admires miss darcy he is in the smallest degree less sensible of your merit than when he took leave of you on tuesday or that it will be in her power to persuade him that instead of being in love with you he is very much in love with her friend ,Pride and Prejudice
if we thought alike of miss bingley replied jane your representation of all this might make me quite easy but i know the foundation is unjust caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving anyone and all that i can hope in this case is that she is deceiving herself ,Pride and Prejudice
that is right you could not have started a more happy idea since you will not take comfort in mine believe her to be deceived by all means you have now done your duty by her and must fret no longer ,Pride and Prejudice
you must decide for yourself said elizabeth and if upon mature deliberation you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife i advise you by all means to refuse him ,Pride and Prejudice
the idea of his returning no more elizabeth treated with the utmost contempt it appeared to her merely the suggestion of carolines interested wishes and she could not for a moment suppose that those wishes however openly or artfully spoken could influence a young man so totally independent of everyone ,Pride and Prejudice
she represented to her sister as forcibly as possible what she felt on the subject and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect janes temper was not desponding and she was gradually led to hope though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope that bingley would return to netherfield and answer every wish of her heart ,Pride and Prejudice
they agreed that mrs bennet should only hear of the departure of the family without being alarmed on the score of the gentlemans conduct but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together after lamenting it however at some length she had the consolation that mr bingley would be soon down again and soon dining at longbourn and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration that though he had been invited only to a family dinner she would take care to have two full courses ,Pride and Prejudice
the bennets were engaged to dine with the lucases and again during the chief of the day was miss lucas so kind as to listen to mr collins elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her it keeps him in good humour said she and i am more obliged to you than i can express charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful and that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time this was very amiable but charlottes kindness extended farther than elizabeth had any conception of its object was nothing else than to secure her from any return of mr collinss addresses by engaging them towards herself such was miss lucass scheme and appearances were so favourable that when they parted at night she would have felt almost secure of success if he had not been to leave hertfordshire so very soon but here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his character for it led him to escape out of longbourn house the next morning with admirable slyness and hasten to lucas lodge to throw himself at her feet he was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins from a conviction that if they saw him depart they could not fail to conjecture his design and he was not willing to have the attempt known till its success might be known likewise for though feeling almost secure and with reason for charlotte had been tolerably encouraging he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of wednesday his reception however was of the most flattering kind miss lucas perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house and instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane but little had she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there ,Pride and Prejudice
in as short a time as mr collinss long speeches would allow everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both and as they entered the house he earnestly entreated her to name the day that was to make him the happiest of men and though such a solicitation must be waived for the present the lady felt no inclination to trifle with his happiness the stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its continuance and miss lucas who accepted him solely from the pure and disinterested desire of an establishment cared not how soon that establishment were gained ,Pride and Prejudice
sir william and lady lucas were speedily applied to for their consent and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity mr collinss present circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter to whom they could give little fortune and his prospects of future wealth were exceedingly fair lady lucas began directly to calculate with more interest than the matter had ever excited before how many years longer mr bennet was likely to live and sir william gave it as his decided opinion that whenever mr collins should be in possession of the longbourn estate it would be highly expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at st jamess the whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the occasion the younger girls formed hopes of coming out a year or two sooner than they might otherwise have done and the boys were relieved from their apprehension of charlottes dying an old maid charlotte herself was tolerably composed she had gained her point and had time to consider of it her reflections were in general satisfactory mr collins to be sure was neither sensible nor agreeable his society was irksome and his attachment to her must be imaginary but still he would be her husband without thinking highly either of men or matrimony marriage had always been her object it was the only provision for welleducated young women of small fortune and however uncertain of giving happiness must be their pleasantest preservative from want this preservative she had now obtained and at the age of twentyseven without having ever been handsome she felt all the good luck of it the least agreeable circumstance in the business was the surprise it must occasion to elizabeth bennet whose friendship she valued beyond that of any other person elizabeth would wonder and probably would blame her and though her resolution was not to be shaken her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation she resolved to give her the information herself and therefore charged mr collins when he returned to longbourn to dinner to drop no hint of what had passed before any of the family a promise of secrecy was of course very dutifully given but it could not be kept without difficulty for the curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct questions on his return as required some ingenuity to evade and he was at the same time exercising great selfdenial for he was longing to publish his prosperous love ,Pride and Prejudice
as he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of the family the ceremony of leavetaking was performed when the ladies moved for the night and mrs bennet with great politeness and cordiality said how happy they should be to see him at longbourn again whenever his engagements might allow him to visit them ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear madam he replied this invitation is particularly gratifying because it is what i have been hoping to receive and you may be very certain that i shall avail myself of it as soon as possible ,Pride and Prejudice
you cannot be too much upon your guard risk anything rather than her displeasure and if you find it likely to be raised by your coming to us again which i should think exceedingly probable stay quietly at home and be satisfied that we shall take no offence ,Pride and Prejudice
believe me my dear sir my gratitude is warmly excited by such affectionate attention and depend upon it you will speedily receive from me a letter of thanks for this and for every other mark of your regard during my stay in hertfordshire as for my fair cousins though my absence may not be long enough to render it necessary i shall now take the liberty of wishing them health and happiness not excepting my cousin elizabeth ,Pride and Prejudice
with proper civilities the ladies then withdrew all of them equally surprised that he meditated a quick return mrs bennet wished to understand by it that he thought of paying his addresses to one of her younger girls and mary might have been prevailed on to accept him she rated his abilities much higher than any of the others there was a solidity in his reflections which often struck her and though by no means so clever as herself she thought that if encouraged to read and improve himself by such an example as hers he might become a very agreeable companion but on the following morning every hope of this kind was done away miss lucas called soon after breakfast and in a private conference with elizabeth related the event of the day before ,Pride and Prejudice
the possibility of mr collinss fancying himself in love with her friend had once occurred to elizabeth within the last day or two but that charlotte could encourage him seemed almost as far from possibility as she could encourage him herself and her astonishment was consequently so great as to overcome at first the bounds of decorum and she could not help crying out ,Pride and Prejudice
the steady countenance which miss lucas had commanded in telling her story gave way to a momentary confusion here on receiving so direct a reproach though as it was no more than she expected she soon regained her composure and calmly replied ,Pride and Prejudice
why should you be surprised my dear eliza do you think it incredible that mr collins should be able to procure any womans good opinion because he was not so happy as to succeed with you ,Pride and Prejudice
but elizabeth had now recollected herself and making a strong effort for it was able to assure with tolerable firmness that the prospect of their relationship was highly grateful to her and that she wished her all imaginable happiness ,Pride and Prejudice
i see what you are feeling replied charlotte you must be surprised very much surprisedso lately as mr collins was wishing to marry you but when you have had time to think it over i hope you will be satisfied with what i have done i am not romantic you know i never was i ask only a comfortable home and considering mr collinss character connection and situation in life i am convinced that my chance of happiness with him is as fair as most people can boast on entering the marriage state ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth quietly answered undoubtedly and after an awkward pause they returned to the rest of the family charlotte did not stay much longer and elizabeth was then left to reflect on what she had heard it was a long time before she became at all reconciled to the idea of so unsuitable a match the strangeness of mr collinss making two offers of marriage within three days was nothing in comparison of his being now accepted she had always felt that charlottes opinion of matrimony was not exactly like her own but she had not supposed it to be possible that when called into action she would have sacrificed every better feeling to worldly advantage charlotte the wife of mr collins was a most humiliating picture and to the pang of a friend disgracing herself and sunk in her esteem was added the distressing conviction that it was impossible for that friend to be tolerably happy in the lot she had chosen ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was sitting with her mother and sisters reflecting on what she had heard and doubting whether she was authorised to mention it when sir william lucas himself appeared sent by his daughter to announce her engagement to the family with many compliments to them and much selfgratulation on the prospect of a connection between the houses he unfolded the matterto an audience not merely wondering but incredulous for mrs bennet with more perseverance than politeness protested he must be entirely mistaken and lydia always unguarded and often uncivil boisterously exclaimed ,Pride and Prejudice
nothing less than the complaisance of a courtier could have borne without anger such treatment but sir williams good breeding carried him through it all and though he begged leave to be positive as to the truth of his information he listened to all their impertinence with the most forbearing courtesy ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth feeling it incumbent on her to relieve him from so unpleasant a situation now put herself forward to confirm his account by mentioning her prior knowledge of it from charlotte herself and endeavoured to put a stop to the exclamations of her mother and sisters by the earnestness of her congratulations to sir william in which she was readily joined by jane and by making a variety of remarks on the happiness that might be expected from the match the excellent character of mr collins and the convenient distance of hunsford from london ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet was in fact too much overpowered to say a great deal while sir william remained but no sooner had he left them than her feelings found a rapid vent in the first place she persisted in disbelieving the whole of the matter secondly she was very sure that mr collins had been taken in thirdly she trusted that they would never be happy together and fourthly that the match might be broken off two inferences however were plainly deduced from the whole one that elizabeth was the real cause of the mischief and the other that she herself had been barbarously misused by them all and on these two points she principally dwelt during the rest of the day nothing could console and nothing could appease her nor did that day wear out her resentment a week elapsed before she could see elizabeth without scolding her a month passed away before she could speak to sir william or lady lucas without being rude and many months were gone before she could at all forgive their daughter ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennets emotions were much more tranquil on the occasion and such as he did experience he pronounced to be of a most agreeable sort for it gratified him he said to discover that charlotte lucas whom he had been used to think tolerably sensible was as foolish as his wife and more foolish than his daughter ,Pride and Prejudice
jane confessed herself a little surprised at the match but she said less of her astonishment than of her earnest desire for their happiness nor could elizabeth persuade her to consider it as improbable kitty and lydia were far from envying miss lucas for mr collins was only a clergyman and it affected them in no other way than as a piece of news to spread at meryton ,Pride and Prejudice
lady lucas could not be insensible of triumph on being able to retort on mrs bennet the comfort of having a daughter well married and she called at longbourn rather oftener than usual to say how happy she was though mrs bennets sour looks and illnatured remarks might have been enough to drive happiness away ,Pride and Prejudice
between elizabeth and charlotte there was a restraint which kept them mutually silent on the subject and elizabeth felt persuaded that no real confidence could ever subsist between them again her disappointment in charlotte made her turn with fonder regard to her sister of whose rectitude and delicacy she was sure her opinion could never be shaken and for whose happiness she grew daily more anxious as bingley had now been gone a week and nothing more was heard of his return ,Pride and Prejudice
jane had sent caroline an early answer to her letter and was counting the days till she might reasonably hope to hear again the promised letter of thanks from mr collins arrived on tuesday addressed to their father and written with all the solemnity of gratitude which a twelvemonths abode in the family might have prompted after discharging his conscience on that head he proceeded to inform them with many rapturous expressions of his happiness in having obtained the affection of their amiable neighbour miss lucas and then explained that it was merely with the view of enjoying her society that he had been so ready to close with their kind wish of seeing him again at longbourn whither he hoped to be able to return on monday fortnight for lady catherine he added so heartily approved his marriage that she wished it to take place as soon as possible which he trusted would be an unanswerable argument with his amiable charlotte to name an early day for making him the happiest of men ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collinss return into hertfordshire was no longer a matter of pleasure to mrs bennet on the contrary she was as much disposed to complain of it as her husband it was very strange that he should come to longbourn instead of to lucas lodge it was also very inconvenient and exceedingly troublesome she hated having visitors in the house while her health was so indifferent and lovers were of all people the most disagreeable such were the gentle murmurs of mrs bennet and they gave way only to the greater distress of mr bingleys continued absence ,Pride and Prejudice
neither jane nor elizabeth were comfortable on this subject day after day passed away without bringing any other tidings of him than the report which shortly prevailed in meryton of his coming no more to netherfield the whole winter a report which highly incensed mrs bennet and which she never failed to contradict as a most scandalous falsehood ,Pride and Prejudice
even elizabeth began to fearnot that bingley was indifferentbut that his sisters would be successful in keeping him away unwilling as she was to admit an idea so destructive of janes happiness and so dishonorable to the stability of her lover she could not prevent its frequently occurring the united efforts of his two unfeeling sisters and of his overpowering friend assisted by the attractions of miss darcy and the amusements of london might be too much she feared for the strength of his attachment ,Pride and Prejudice
as for jane her anxiety under this suspense was of course more painful than elizabeths but whatever she felt she was desirous of concealing and between herself and elizabeth therefore the subject was never alluded to but as no such delicacy restrained her mother an hour seldom passed in which she did not talk of bingley express her impatience for his arrival or even require jane to confess that if he did not come back she would think herself very ill used it needed all janes steady mildness to bear these attacks with tolerable tranquillity ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins returned most punctually on monday fortnight but his reception at longbourn was not quite so gracious as it had been on his first introduction he was too happy however to need much attention and luckily for the others the business of lovemaking relieved them from a great deal of his company the chief of every day was spent by him at lucas lodge and he sometimes returned to longbourn only in time to make an apology for his absence before the family went to bed ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet was really in a most pitiable state the very mention of anything concerning the match threw her into an agony of illhumour and wherever she went she was sure of hearing it talked of the sight of miss lucas was odious to her as her successor in that house she regarded her with jealous abhorrence whenever charlotte came to see them she concluded her to be anticipating the hour of possession and whenever she spoke in a low voice to mr collins was convinced that they were talking of the longbourn estate and resolving to turn herself and her daughters out of the house as soon as mr bennet were dead she complained bitterly of all this to her husband ,Pride and Prejudice
indeed mr bennet said she it is very hard to think that charlotte lucas should ever be mistress of this house that i should be forced to make way for her and live to see her take her place in it ,Pride and Prejudice
i never can be thankful mr bennet for anything about the entail how anyone could have the conscience to entail away an estate from ones own daughters i cannot understand and all for the sake of mr collins too why should he have it more than anybody else ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bingleys letter arrived and put an end to doubt the very first sentence conveyed the assurance of their being all settled in london for the winter and concluded with her brothers regret at not having had time to pay his respects to his friends in hertfordshire before he left the country ,Pride and Prejudice
hope was over entirely over and when jane could attend to the rest of the letter she found little except the professed affection of the writer that could give her any comfort miss darcys praise occupied the chief of it her many attractions were again dwelt on and caroline boasted joyfully of their increasing intimacy and ventured to predict the accomplishment of the wishes which had been unfolded in her former letter she wrote also with great pleasure of her brothers being an inmate of mr darcys house and mentioned with raptures some plans of the latter with regard to new furniture ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth to whom jane very soon communicated the chief of all this heard it in silent indignation her heart was divided between concern for her sister and resentment against all others to carolines assertion of her brothers being partial to miss darcy she paid no credit that he was really fond of jane she doubted no more than she had ever done and much as she had always been disposed to like him she could not think without anger hardly without contempt on that easiness of temper that want of proper resolution which now made him the slave of his designing friends and led him to sacrifice of his own happiness to the caprice of their inclination had his own happiness however been the only sacrifice he might have been allowed to sport with it in whatever manner he thought best but her sisters was involved in it as she thought he must be sensible himself it was a subject in short on which reflection would be long indulged and must be unavailing she could think of nothing else and yet whether bingleys regard had really died away or were suppressed by his friends interference whether he had been aware of janes attachment or whether it had escaped his observation whatever were the case though her opinion of him must be materially affected by the difference her sisters situation remained the same her peace equally wounded ,Pride and Prejudice
a day or two passed before jane had courage to speak of her feelings to elizabeth but at last on mrs bennets leaving them together after a longer irritation than usual about netherfield and its master she could not help saying ,Pride and Prejudice
oh that my dear mother had more command over herself she can have no idea of the pain she gives me by her continual reflections on him but i will not repine it cannot last long he will be forgot and we shall all be as we were before ,Pride and Prejudice
you doubt me cried jane slightly colouring indeed you have no reason he may live in my memory as the most amiable man of my acquaintance but that is all i have nothing either to hope or fear and nothing to reproach him with thank god i have not that pain a little time thereforei shall certainly try to get the better ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear jane exclaimed elizabeth you are too good your sweetness and disinterestedness are really angelic i do not know what to say to you i feel as if i had never done you justice or loved you as you deserve ,Pride and Prejudice
nay said elizabeth this is not fair you wish to think all the world respectable and are hurt if i speak ill of anybody i only want to think you perfect and you set yourself against it do not be afraid of my running into any excess of my encroaching on your privilege of universal goodwill you need not there are few people whom i really love and still fewer of whom i think well the more i see of the world the more am i dissatisfied with it and every day confirms my belief of the inconsistency of all human characters and of the little dependence that can be placed on the appearance of merit or sense i have met with two instances lately one i will not mention the other is charlottes marriage it is unaccountable in every view it is unaccountable ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear lizzy do not give way to such feelings as these they will ruin your happiness you do not make allowance enough for difference of situation and temper consider mr collinss respectability and charlottes steady prudent character remember that she is one of a large family that as to fortune it is a most eligible match and be ready to believe for everybodys sake that she may feel something like regard and esteem for our cousin ,Pride and Prejudice
to oblige you i would try to believe almost anything but no one else could be benefited by such a belief as this for were i persuaded that charlotte had any regard for him i should only think worse of her understanding than i now do of her heart my dear jane mr collins is a conceited pompous narrowminded silly man you know he is as well as i do and you must feel as well as i do that the woman who married him cannot have a proper way of thinking you shall not defend her though it is charlotte lucas you shall not for the sake of one individual change the meaning of principle and integrity nor endeavour to persuade yourself or me that selfishness is prudence and insensibility of danger security for happiness ,Pride and Prejudice
i must think your language too strong in speaking of both replied jane and i hope you will be convinced of it by seeing them happy together but enough of this you alluded to something else you mentioned two instances i cannot misunderstand you but i entreat you dear lizzy not to pain me by thinking that person to blame and saying your opinion of him is sunk we must not be so ready to fancy ourselves intentionally injured we must not expect a lively young man to be always so guarded and circumspect it is very often nothing but our own vanity that deceives us women fancy admiration means more than it does ,Pride and Prejudice
i am far from attributing any part of mr bingleys conduct to design said elizabeth but without scheming to do wrong or to make others unhappy there may be error and there may be misery thoughtlessness want of attention to other peoples feelings and want of resolution will do the business ,Pride and Prejudice
your first position is false they may wish many things besides his happiness they may wish his increase of wealth and consequence they may wish him to marry a girl who has all the importance of money great connections and pride ,Pride and Prejudice
beyond a doubt they do wish him to choose miss darcy replied jane but this may be from better feelings than you are supposing they have known her much longer than they have known me no wonder if they love her better but whatever may be their own wishes it is very unlikely they should have opposed their brothers what sister would think herself at liberty to do it unless there were something very objectionable if they believed him attached to me they would not try to part us if he were so they could not succeed by supposing such an affection you make everybody acting unnaturally and wrong and me most unhappy do not distress me by the idea i am not ashamed of having been mistakenor at least it is light it is nothing in comparison of what i should feel in thinking ill of him or his sisters let me take it in the best light in the light in which it may be understood ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet still continued to wonder and repine at his returning no more and though a day seldom passed in which elizabeth did not account for it clearly there was little chance of her ever considering it with less perplexity her daughter endeavoured to convince her of what she did not believe herself that his attentions to jane had been merely the effect of a common and transient liking which ceased when he saw her no more but though the probability of the statement was admitted at the time she had the same story to repeat every day mrs bennets best comfort was that mr bingley must be down again in the summer ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennet treated the matter differently so lizzy said he one day your sister is crossed in love i find i congratulate her next to being married a girl likes to be crossed a little in love now and then it is something to think of and it gives her a sort of distinction among her companions when is your turn to come you will hardly bear to be long outdone by jane now is your time here are officers enough in meryton to disappoint all the young ladies in the country let wickham be your man he is a pleasant fellow and would jilt you creditably ,Pride and Prejudice
mr wickhams society was of material service in dispelling the gloom which the late perverse occurrences had thrown on many of the longbourn family they saw him often and to his other recommendations was now added that of general unreserve the whole of what elizabeth had already heard his claims on mr darcy and all that he had suffered from him was now openly acknowledged and publicly canvassed and everybody was pleased to know how much they had always disliked mr darcy before they had known anything of the matter ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bennet was the only creature who could suppose there might be any extenuating circumstances in the case unknown to the society of hertfordshire her mild and steady candour always pleaded for allowances and urged the possibility of mistakesbut by everybody else mr darcy was condemned as the worst of men ,Pride and Prejudice
after a week spent in professions of love and schemes of felicity mr collins was called from his amiable charlotte by the arrival of saturday the pain of separation however might be alleviated on his side by preparations for the reception of his bride as he had reason to hope that shortly after his return into hertfordshire the day would be fixed that was to make him the happiest of men he took leave of his relations at longbourn with as much solemnity as before wished his fair cousins health and happiness again and promised their father another letter of thanks ,Pride and Prejudice
on the following monday mrs bennet had the pleasure of receiving her brother and his wife who came as usual to spend the christmas at longbourn mr gardiner was a sensible gentlemanlike man greatly superior to his sister as well by nature as education the netherfield ladies would have had difficulty in believing that a man who lived by trade and within view of his own warehouses could have been so wellbred and agreeable mrs gardiner who was several years younger than mrs bennet and mrs phillips was an amiable intelligent elegant woman and a great favourite with all her longbourn nieces between the two eldest and herself especially there subsisted a particular regard they had frequently been staying with her in town ,Pride and Prejudice
the first part of mrs gardiners business on her arrival was to distribute her presents and describe the newest fashions when this was done she had a less active part to play it became her turn to listen mrs bennet had many grievances to relate and much to complain of they had all been very illused since she last saw her sister two of her girls had been upon the point of marriage and after all there was nothing in it ,Pride and Prejudice
i do not blame jane she continued for jane would have got mr bingley if she could but lizzy oh sister it is very hard to think that she might have been mr collinss wife by this time had it not been for her own perverseness he made her an offer in this very room and she refused him the consequence of it is that lady lucas will have a daughter married before i have and that the longbourn estate is just as much entailed as ever the lucases are very artful people indeed sister they are all for what they can get i am sorry to say it of them but so it is it makes me very nervous and poorly to be thwarted so in my own family and to have neighbours who think of themselves before anybody else however your coming just at this time is the greatest of comforts and i am very glad to hear what you tell us of long sleeves ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner to whom the chief of this news had been given before in the course of jane and elizabeths correspondence with her made her sister a slight answer and in compassion to her nieces turned the conversation ,Pride and Prejudice
when alone with elizabeth afterwards she spoke more on the subject it seems likely to have been a desirable match for jane said she i am sorry it went off but these things happen so often a young man such as you describe mr bingley so easily falls in love with a pretty girl for a few weeks and when accident separates them so easily forgets her that these sort of inconsistencies are very frequent ,Pride and Prejudice
an excellent consolation in its way said elizabeth but it will not do for us we do not suffer by accident it does not often happen that the interference of friends will persuade a young man of independent fortune to think no more of a girl whom he was violently in love with only a few days before ,Pride and Prejudice
but that expression of violently in love is so hackneyed so doubtful so indefinite that it gives me very little idea it is as often applied to feelings which arise from a halfhours acquaintance as to a real strong attachment pray how violent was mr bingleys love ,Pride and Prejudice
i never saw a more promising inclination he was growing quite inattentive to other people and wholly engrossed by her every time they met it was more decided and remarkable at his own ball he offended two or three young ladies by not asking them to dance and i spoke to him twice myself without receiving an answer could there be finer symptoms is not general incivility the very essence of love ,Pride and Prejudice
oh yesof that kind of love which i suppose him to have felt poor jane i am sorry for her because with her disposition she may not get over it immediately it had better have happened to you lizzy you would have laughed yourself out of it sooner but do you think she would be prevailed upon to go back with us change of scene might be of serviceand perhaps a little relief from home may be as useful as anything ,Pride and Prejudice
i hope added mrs gardiner that no consideration with regard to this young man will influence her we live in so different a part of town all our connections are so different and as you well know we go out so little that it is very improbable that they should meet at all unless he really comes to see her ,Pride and Prejudice
and that is quite impossible for he is now in the custody of his friend and mr darcy would no more suffer him to call on jane in such a part of london my dear aunt how could you think of it mr darcy may perhaps have heard of such a place as gracechurch street but he would hardly think a months ablution enough to cleanse him from its impurities were he once to enter it and depend upon it mr bingley never stirs without him ,Pride and Prejudice
but in spite of the certainty in which elizabeth affected to place this point as well as the still more interesting one of bingleys being withheld from seeing jane she felt a solicitude on the subject which convinced her on examination that she did not consider it entirely hopeless it was possible and sometimes she thought it probable that his affection might be reanimated and the influence of his friends successfully combated by the more natural influence of janes attractions ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bennet accepted her aunts invitation with pleasure and the bingleys were no otherwise in her thoughts at the same time than as she hoped by carolines not living in the same house with her brother she might occasionally spend a morning with her without any danger of seeing him ,Pride and Prejudice
the gardiners stayed a week at longbourn and what with the phillipses the lucases and the officers there was not a day without its engagement mrs bennet had so carefully provided for the entertainment of her brother and sister that they did not once sit down to a family dinner when the engagement was for home some of the officers always made part of itof which officers mr wickham was sure to be one and on these occasions mrs gardiner rendered suspicious by elizabeths warm commendation narrowly observed them both without supposing them from what she saw to be very seriously in love their preference of each other was plain enough to make her a little uneasy and she resolved to speak to elizabeth on the subject before she left hertfordshire and represent to her the imprudence of encouraging such an attachment ,Pride and Prejudice
to mrs gardiner wickham had one means of affording pleasure unconnected with his general powers about ten or a dozen years ago before her marriage she had spent a considerable time in that very part of derbyshire to which he belonged they had therefore many acquaintances in common and though wickham had been little there since the death of darcys father it was yet in his power to give her fresher intelligence of her former friends than she had been in the way of procuring ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner had seen pemberley and known the late mr darcy by character perfectly well here consequently was an inexhaustible subject of discourse in comparing her recollection of pemberley with the minute description which wickham could give and in bestowing her tribute of praise on the character of its late possessor she was delighting both him and herself on being made acquainted with the present mr darcys treatment of him she tried to remember some of that gentlemans reputed disposition when quite a lad which might agree with it and was confident at last that she recollected having heard mr fitzwilliam darcy formerly spoken of as a very proud illnatured boy ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiners caution to elizabeth was punctually and kindly given on the first favourable opportunity of speaking to her alone after honestly telling her what she thought she thus went on ,Pride and Prejudice
you are too sensible a girl lizzy to fall in love merely because you are warned against it and therefore i am not afraid of speaking openly seriously i would have you be on your guard do not involve yourself or endeavour to involve him in an affection which the want of fortune would make so very imprudent i have nothing to say against him he is a most interesting young man and if he had the fortune he ought to have i should think you could not do better but as it is you must not let your fancy run away with you you have sense and we all expect you to use it your father would depend on your resolution and good conduct i am sure you must not disappoint your father ,Pride and Prejudice
i beg your pardon i will try again at present i am not in love with mr wickham no i certainly am not but he is beyond all comparison the most agreeable man i ever sawand if he becomes really attached to mei believe it will be better that he should not i see the imprudence of it oh that abominable mr darcy my fathers opinion of me does me the greatest honour and i should be miserable to forfeit it my father however is partial to mr wickham in short my dear aunt i should be very sorry to be the means of making any of you unhappy but since we see every day that where there is affection young people are seldom withheld by immediate want of fortune from entering into engagements with each other how can i promise to be wiser than so many of my fellowcreatures if i am tempted or how am i even to know that it would be wisdom to resist all that i can promise you therefore is not to be in a hurry i will not be in a hurry to believe myself his first object when i am in company with him i will not be wishing in short i will do my best ,Pride and Prejudice
as i did the other day said elizabeth with a conscious smile very true it will be wise in me to refrain from that but do not imagine that he is always here so often it is on your account that he has been so frequently invited this week you know my mothers ideas as to the necessity of constant company for her friends but really and upon my honour i will try to do what i think to be the wisest and now i hope you are satisfied ,Pride and Prejudice
her aunt assured her that she was and elizabeth having thanked her for the kindness of her hints they parted a wonderful instance of advice being given on such a point without being resented ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins returned into hertfordshire soon after it had been quitted by the gardiners and jane but as he took up his abode with the lucases his arrival was no great inconvenience to mrs bennet his marriage was now fast approaching and she was at length so far resigned as to think it inevitable and even repeatedly to say in an illnatured tone that she wished they might be happy thursday was to be the wedding day and on wednesday miss lucas paid her farewell visit and when she rose to take leave elizabeth ashamed of her mothers ungracious and reluctant good wishes and sincerely affected herself accompanied her out of the room as they went downstairs together charlotte said ,Pride and Prejudice
the wedding took place the bride and bridegroom set off for kent from the church door and everybody had as much to say or to hear on the subject as usual elizabeth soon heard from her friend and their correspondence was as regular and frequent as it had ever been that it should be equally unreserved was impossible elizabeth could never address her without feeling that all the comfort of intimacy was over and though determined not to slacken as a correspondent it was for the sake of what had been rather than what was charlottes first letters were received with a good deal of eagerness there could not but be curiosity to know how she would speak of her new home how she would like lady catherine and how happy she would dare pronounce herself to be though when the letters were read elizabeth felt that charlotte expressed herself on every point exactly as she might have foreseen she wrote cheerfully seemed surrounded with comforts and mentioned nothing which she could not praise the house furniture neighbourhood and roads were all to her taste and lady catherines behaviour was most friendly and obliging it was mr collinss picture of hunsford and rosings rationally softened and elizabeth perceived that she must wait for her own visit there to know the rest ,Pride and Prejudice
her impatience for this second letter was as well rewarded as impatience generally is jane had been a week in town without either seeing or hearing from caroline she accounted for it however by supposing that her last letter to her friend from longbourn had by some accident been lost ,Pride and Prejudice
she wrote again when the visit was paid and she had seen miss bingley i did not think caroline in spirits were her words but she was very glad to see me and reproached me for giving her no notice of my coming to london i was right therefore my last letter had never reached her i enquired after their brother of course he was well but so much engaged with mr darcy that they scarcely ever saw him i found that miss darcy was expected to dinner i wish i could see her my visit was not long as caroline and mrs hurst were going out i dare say i shall see them soon here ,Pride and Prejudice
four weeks passed away and jane saw nothing of him she endeavoured to persuade herself that she did not regret it but she could no longer be blind to miss bingleys inattention after waiting at home every morning for a fortnight and inventing every evening a fresh excuse for her the visitor did at last appear but the shortness of her stay and yet more the alteration of her manner would allow jane to deceive herself no longer the letter which she wrote on this occasion to her sister will prove what she felt ,Pride and Prejudice
my dearest lizzy will i am sure be incapable of triumphing in her better judgement at my expense when i confess myself to have been entirely deceived in miss bingleys regard for me but my dear sister though the event has proved you right do not think me obstinate if i still assert that considering what her behaviour was my confidence was as natural as your suspicion i do not at all comprehend her reason for wishing to be intimate with me but if the same circumstances were to happen again i am sure i should be deceived again caroline did not return my visit till yesterday and not a note not a line did i receive in the meantime when she did come it was very evident that she had no pleasure in it she made a slight formal apology for not calling before said not a word of wishing to see me again and was in every respect so altered a creature that when she went away i was perfectly resolved to continue the acquaintance no longer i pity though i cannot help blaming her she was very wrong in singling me out as she did i can safely say that every advance to intimacy began on her side but i pity her because she must feel that she has been acting wrong and because i am very sure that anxiety for her brother is the cause of it i need not explain myself farther and though we know this anxiety to be quite needless yet if she feels it it will easily account for her behaviour to me and so deservedly dear as he is to his sister whatever anxiety she must feel on his behalf is natural and amiable i cannot but wonder however at her having any such fears now because if he had at all cared about me we must have met long ago he knows of my being in town i am certain from something she said herself and yet it would seem by her manner of talking as if she wanted to persuade herself that he is really partial to miss darcy i cannot understand it if i were not afraid of judging harshly i should be almost tempted to say that there is a strong appearance of duplicity in all this but i will endeavour to banish every painful thought and think only of what will make me happyyour affection and the invariable kindness of my dear uncle and aunt let me hear from you very soon miss bingley said something of his never returning to netherfield again of giving up the house but not with any certainty we had better not mention it i am extremely glad that you have such pleasant accounts from our friends at hunsford pray go to see them with sir william and maria i am sure you will be very comfortable thereyours etc ,Pride and Prejudice
this letter gave elizabeth some pain but her spirits returned as she considered that jane would no longer be duped by the sister at least all expectation from the brother was now absolutely over she would not even wish for a renewal of his attentions his character sunk on every review of it and as a punishment for him as well as a possible advantage to jane she seriously hoped he might really soon marry mr darcys sister as by wickhams account she would make him abundantly regret what he had thrown away ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner about this time reminded elizabeth of her promise concerning that gentleman and required information and elizabeth had such to send as might rather give contentment to her aunt than to herself his apparent partiality had subsided his attentions were over he was the admirer of some one else elizabeth was watchful enough to see it all but she could see it and write of it without material pain her heart had been but slightly touched and her vanity was satisfied with believing that she would have been his only choice had fortune permitted it the sudden acquisition of ten thousand pounds was the most remarkable charm of the young lady to whom he was now rendering himself agreeable but elizabeth less clearsighted perhaps in this case than in charlottes did not quarrel with him for his wish of independence nothing on the contrary could be more natural and while able to suppose that it cost him a few struggles to relinquish her she was ready to allow it a wise and desirable measure for both and could very sincerely wish him happy ,Pride and Prejudice
all this was acknowledged to mrs gardiner and after relating the circumstances she thus went on i am now convinced my dear aunt that i have never been much in love for had i really experienced that pure and elevating passion i should at present detest his very name and wish him all manner of evil but my feelings are not only cordial towards him they are even impartial towards miss king i cannot find out that i hate her at all or that i am in the least unwilling to think her a very good sort of girl there can be no love in all this my watchfulness has been effectual and though i certainly should be a more interesting object to all my acquaintances were i distractedly in love with him i cannot say that i regret my comparative insignificance importance may sometimes be purchased too dearly kitty and lydia take his defection much more to heart than i do they are young in the ways of the world and not yet open to the mortifying conviction that handsome young men must have something to live on as well as the plain ,Pride and Prejudice
with no greater events than these in the longbourn family and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to meryton sometimes dirty and sometimes cold did january and february pass away march was to take elizabeth to hunsford she had not at first thought very seriously of going thither but charlotte she soon found was depending on the plan and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty absence had increased her desire of seeing charlotte again and weakened her disgust of mr collins there was novelty in the scheme and as with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters home could not be faultless a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake the journey would moreover give her a peep at jane and in short as the time drew near she would have been very sorry for any delay everything however went on smoothly and was finally settled according to charlottes first sketch she was to accompany sir william and his second daughter the improvement of spending a night in london was added in time and the plan became perfect as plan could be ,Pride and Prejudice
the only pain was in leaving her father who would certainly miss her and who when it came to the point so little liked her going that he told her to write to him and almost promised to answer her letter ,Pride and Prejudice
the farewell between herself and mr wickham was perfectly friendly on his side even more his present pursuit could not make him forget that elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention the first to listen and to pity the first to be admired and in his manner of bidding her adieu wishing her every enjoyment reminding her of what she was to expect in lady catherine de bourgh and trusting their opinion of hertheir opinion of everybodywould always coincide there was a solicitude an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard and she parted from him convinced that whether married or single he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing ,Pride and Prejudice
her fellowtravellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable sir william lucas and his daughter maria a goodhumoured girl but as emptyheaded as himself had nothing to say that could be worth hearing and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise elizabeth loved absurdities but she had known sir williams too long he could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood and his civilities were worn out like his information ,Pride and Prejudice
it was a journey of only twentyfour miles and they began it so early as to be in gracechurch street by noon as they drove to mr gardiners door jane was at a drawingroom window watching their arrival when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them and elizabeth looking earnestly in her face was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever on the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls whose eagerness for their cousins appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawingroom and whose shyness as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth prevented their coming lower all was joy and kindness the day passed most pleasantly away the morning in bustle and shopping and the evening at one of the theatres ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt their first object was her sister and she was more grieved than astonished to hear in reply to her minute enquiries that though jane always struggled to support her spirits there were periods of dejection it was reasonable however to hope that they would not continue long mrs gardiner gave her the particulars also of miss bingleys visit in gracechurch street and repeated conversations occurring at different times between jane and herself which proved that the former had from her heart given up the acquaintance ,Pride and Prejudice
pray my dear aunt what is the difference in matrimonial affairs between the mercenary and the prudent motive where does discretion end and avarice begin last christmas you were afraid of his marrying me because it would be imprudent and now because he is trying to get a girl with only ten thousand pounds you want to find out that he is mercenary ,Pride and Prejudice
nowhy should he if it were not allowable for him to gain my affections because i had no money what occasion could there be for making love to a girl whom he did not care about and who was equally poor ,Pride and Prejudice
oh if that is all i have a very poor opinion of young men who live in derbyshire and their intimate friends who live in hertfordshire are not much better i am sick of them all thank heaven i am going tomorrow where i shall find a man who has not one agreeable quality who has neither manner nor sense to recommend him stupid men are the only ones worth knowing after all ,Pride and Prejudice
before they were separated by the conclusion of the play she had the unexpected happiness of an invitation to accompany her uncle and aunt in a tour of pleasure which they proposed taking in the summer ,Pride and Prejudice
no scheme could have been more agreeable to elizabeth and her acceptance of the invitation was most ready and grateful oh my dear dear aunt she rapturously cried what delight what felicity you give me fresh life and vigour adieu to disappointment and spleen what are young men to rocks and mountains oh what hours of transport we shall spend and when we do return it shall not be like other travellers without being able to give one accurate idea of anything we will know where we have gonewe will recollect what we have seen lakes mountains and rivers shall not be jumbled together in our imaginations nor when we attempt to describe any particular scene will we begin quarreling about its relative situation let our first effusions be less insupportable than those of the generality of travellers ,Pride and Prejudice
every object in the next days journey was new and interesting to elizabeth and her spirits were in a state of enjoyment for she had seen her sister looking so well as to banish all fear for her health and the prospect of her northern tour was a constant source of delight ,Pride and Prejudice
when they left the high road for the lane to hunsford every eye was in search of the parsonage and every turning expected to bring it in view the palings of rosings park was their boundary on one side elizabeth smiled at the recollection of all that she had heard of its inhabitants ,Pride and Prejudice
at length the parsonage was discernible the garden sloping to the road the house standing in it the green pales and the laurel hedge everything declared they were arriving mr collins and charlotte appeared at the door and the carriage stopped at the small gate which led by a short gravel walk to the house amidst the nods and smiles of the whole party in a moment they were all out of the chaise rejoicing at the sight of each other mrs collins welcomed her friend with the liveliest pleasure and elizabeth was more and more satisfied with coming when she found herself so affectionately received she saw instantly that her cousins manners were not altered by his marriage his formal civility was just what it had been and he detained her some minutes at the gate to hear and satisfy his enquiries after all her family they were then with no other delay than his pointing out the neatness of the entrance taken into the house and as soon as they were in the parlour he welcomed them a second time with ostentatious formality to his humble abode and punctually repeated all his wifes offers of refreshment ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was prepared to see him in his glory and she could not help in fancying that in displaying the good proportion of the room its aspect and its furniture he addressed himself particularly to her as if wishing to make her feel what she had lost in refusing him but though everything seemed neat and comfortable she was not able to gratify him by any sigh of repentance and rather looked with wonder at her friend that she could have so cheerful an air with such a companion when mr collins said anything of which his wife might reasonably be ashamed which certainly was not unseldom she involuntarily turned her eye on charlotte once or twice she could discern a faint blush but in general charlotte wisely did not hear after sitting long enough to admire every article of furniture in the room from the sideboard to the fender to give an account of their journey and of all that had happened in london mr collins invited them to take a stroll in the garden which was large and well laid out and to the cultivation of which he attended himself to work in this garden was one of his most respectable pleasures and elizabeth admired the command of countenance with which charlotte talked of the healthfulness of the exercise and owned she encouraged it as much as possible here leading the way through every walk and cross walk and scarcely allowing them an interval to utter the praises he asked for every view was pointed out with a minuteness which left beauty entirely behind he could number the fields in every direction and could tell how many trees there were in the most distant clump but of all the views which his garden or which the country or kingdom could boast none were to be compared with the prospect of rosings afforded by an opening in the trees that bordered the park nearly opposite the front of his house it was a handsome modern building well situated on rising ground ,Pride and Prejudice
from his garden mr collins would have led them round his two meadows but the ladies not having shoes to encounter the remains of a white frost turned back and while sir william accompanied him charlotte took her sister and friend over the house extremely well pleased probably to have the opportunity of showing it without her husbands help it was rather small but well built and convenient and everything was fitted up and arranged with a neatness and consistency of which elizabeth gave charlotte all the credit when mr collins could be forgotten there was really an air of great comfort throughout and by charlottes evident enjoyment of it elizabeth supposed he must be often forgotten ,Pride and Prejudice
yes miss elizabeth you will have the honour of seeing lady catherine de bourgh on the ensuing sunday at church and i need not say you will be delighted with her she is all affability and condescension and i doubt not but you will be honoured with some portion of her notice when service is over i have scarcely any hesitation in saying she will include you and my sister maria in every invitation with which she honours us during your stay here her behaviour to my dear charlotte is charming we dine at rosings twice every week and are never allowed to walk home her ladyships carriage is regularly ordered for us i should say one of her ladyships carriages for she has several ,Pride and Prejudice
the evening was spent chiefly in talking over hertfordshire news and telling again what had already been written and when it closed elizabeth in the solitude of her chamber had to meditate upon charlottes degree of contentment to understand her address in guiding and composure in bearing with her husband and to acknowledge that it was all done very well she had also to anticipate how her visit would pass the quiet tenor of their usual employments the vexatious interruptions of mr collins and the gaieties of their intercourse with rosings a lively imagination soon settled it all ,Pride and Prejudice
about the middle of the next day as she was in her room getting ready for a walk a sudden noise below seemed to speak the whole house in confusion and after listening a moment she heard somebody running up stairs in a violent hurry and calling loudly after her she opened the door and met maria in the landing place who breathless with agitation cried out ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth asked questions in vain maria would tell her nothing more and down they ran into the diningroom which fronted the lane in quest of this wonder it was two ladies stopping in a low phaeton at the garden gate ,Pride and Prejudice
la my dear said maria quite shocked at the mistake it is not lady catherine the old lady is mrs jenkinson who lives with them the other is miss de bourgh only look at her she is quite a little creature who would have thought that she could be so thin and small ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collins and charlotte were both standing at the gate in conversation with the ladies and sir william to elizabeths high diversion was stationed in the doorway in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him and constantly bowing whenever miss de bourgh looked that way ,Pride and Prejudice
at length there was nothing more to be said the ladies drove on and the others returned into the house mr collins no sooner saw the two girls than he began to congratulate them on their good fortune which charlotte explained by letting them know that the whole party was asked to dine at rosings the next day ,Pride and Prejudice
mr collinss triumph in consequence of this invitation was complete the power of displaying the grandeur of his patroness to his wondering visitors and of letting them see her civility towards himself and his wife was exactly what he had wished for and that an opportunity of doing it should be given so soon was such an instance of lady catherines condescension as he knew not how to admire enough ,Pride and Prejudice
i confess said he that i should not have been at all surprised by her ladyships asking us on sunday to drink tea and spend the evening at rosings i rather expected from my knowledge of her affability that it would happen but who could have foreseen such an attention as this who could have imagined that we should receive an invitation to dine there an invitation moreover including the whole party so immediately after your arrival ,Pride and Prejudice
i am the less surprised at what has happened replied sir william from that knowledge of what the manners of the great really are which my situation in life has allowed me to acquire about the court such instances of elegant breeding are not uncommon ,Pride and Prejudice
scarcely anything was talked of the whole day or next morning but their visit to rosings mr collins was carefully instructing them in what they were to expect that the sight of such rooms so many servants and so splendid a dinner might not wholly overpower them ,Pride and Prejudice
do not make yourself uneasy my dear cousin about your apparel lady catherine is far from requiring that elegance of dress in us which becomes herself and her daughter i would advise you merely to put on whatever of your clothes is superior to the restthere is no occasion for anything more lady catherine will not think the worse of you for being simply dressed she likes to have the distinction of rank preserved ,Pride and Prejudice
while they were dressing he came two or three times to their different doors to recommend their being quick as lady catherine very much objected to be kept waiting for her dinner such formidable accounts of her ladyship and her manner of living quite frightened maria lucas who had been little used to company and she looked forward to her introduction at rosings with as much apprehension as her father had done to his presentation at st jamess ,Pride and Prejudice
as the weather was fine they had a pleasant walk of about half a mile across the park every park has its beauty and its prospects and elizabeth saw much to be pleased with though she could not be in such raptures as mr collins expected the scene to inspire and was but slightly affected by his enumeration of the windows in front of the house and his relation of what the glazing altogether had originally cost sir lewis de bourgh ,Pride and Prejudice
when they ascended the steps to the hall marias alarm was every moment increasing and even sir william did not look perfectly calm elizabeths courage did not fail her she had heard nothing of lady catherine that spoke her awful from any extraordinary talents or miraculous virtue and the mere stateliness of money or rank she thought she could witness without trepidation ,Pride and Prejudice
from the entrancehall of which mr collins pointed out with a rapturous air the fine proportion and the finished ornaments they followed the servants through an antechamber to the room where lady catherine her daughter and mrs jenkinson were sitting her ladyship with great condescension arose to receive them and as mrs collins had settled it with her husband that the office of introduction should be hers it was performed in a proper manner without any of those apologies and thanks which he would have thought necessary ,Pride and Prejudice
in spite of having been at st jamess sir william was so completely awed by the grandeur surrounding him that he had but just courage enough to make a very low bow and take his seat without saying a word and his daughter frightened almost out of her senses sat on the edge of her chair not knowing which way to look elizabeth found herself quite equal to the scene and could observe the three ladies before her composedly lady catherine was a tall large woman with stronglymarked features which might once have been handsome her air was not conciliating nor was her manner of receiving them such as to make her visitors forget their inferior rank she was not rendered formidable by silence but whatever she said was spoken in so authoritative a tone as marked her selfimportance and brought mr wickham immediately to elizabeths mind and from the observation of the day altogether she believed lady catherine to be exactly what he represented ,Pride and Prejudice
when after examining the mother in whose countenance and deportment she soon found some resemblance of mr darcy she turned her eyes on the daughter she could almost have joined in marias astonishment at her being so thin and so small there was neither in figure nor face any likeness between the ladies miss de bourgh was pale and sickly her features though not plain were insignificant and she spoke very little except in a low voice to mrs jenkinson in whose appearance there was nothing remarkable and who was entirely engaged in listening to what she said and placing a screen in the proper direction before her eyes ,Pride and Prejudice
after sitting a few minutes they were all sent to one of the windows to admire the view mr collins attending them to point out its beauties and lady catherine kindly informing them that it was much better worth looking at in the summer ,Pride and Prejudice
the dinner was exceedingly handsome and there were all the servants and all the articles of plate which mr collins had promised and as he had likewise foretold he took his seat at the bottom of the table by her ladyships desire and looked as if he felt that life could furnish nothing greater he carved and ate and praised with delighted alacrity and every dish was commended first by him and then by sir william who was now enough recovered to echo whatever his soninlaw said in a manner which elizabeth wondered lady catherine could bear but lady catherine seemed gratified by their excessive admiration and gave most gracious smiles especially when any dish on the table proved a novelty to them the party did not supply much conversation elizabeth was ready to speak whenever there was an opening but she was seated between charlotte and miss de bourghthe former of whom was engaged in listening to lady catherine and the latter said not a word to her all dinnertime mrs jenkinson was chiefly employed in watching how little miss de bourgh ate pressing her to try some other dish and fearing she was indisposed maria thought speaking out of the question and the gentlemen did nothing but eat and admire ,Pride and Prejudice
when the ladies returned to the drawingroom there was little to be done but to hear lady catherine talk which she did without any intermission till coffee came in delivering her opinion on every subject in so decisive a manner as proved that she was not used to have her judgement controverted she enquired into charlottes domestic concerns familiarly and minutely gave her a great deal of advice as to the management of them all told her how everything ought to be regulated in so small a family as hers and instructed her as to the care of her cows and her poultry elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great ladys attention which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others in the intervals of her discourse with mrs collins she addressed a variety of questions to maria and elizabeth but especially to the latter of whose connections she knew the least and who she observed to mrs collins was a very genteel pretty kind of girl she asked her at different times how many sisters she had whether they were older or younger than herself whether any of them were likely to be married whether they were handsome where they had been educated what carriage her father kept and what had been her mothers maiden name elizabeth felt all the impertinence of her questions but answered them very composedly lady catherine then observed ,Pride and Prejudice
your fathers estate is entailed on mr collins i think for your sake turning to charlotte i am glad of it but otherwise i see no occasion for entailing estates from the female line it was not thought necessary in sir lewis de bourghs family do you play and sing miss bennet ,Pride and Prejudice
compared with some families i believe we were but such of us as wished to learn never wanted the means we were always encouraged to read and had all the masters that were necessary those who chose to be idle certainly might ,Pride and Prejudice
aye no doubt but that is what a governess will prevent and if i had known your mother i should have advised her most strenuously to engage one i always say that nothing is to be done in education without steady and regular instruction and nobody but a governess can give it it is wonderful how many families i have been the means of supplying in that way i am always glad to get a young person well placed out four nieces of mrs jenkinson are most delightfully situated through my means and it was but the other day that i recommended another young person who was merely accidentally mentioned to me and the family are quite delighted with her mrs collins did i tell you of lady metcalfs calling yesterday to thank me she finds miss pope a treasure lady catherine said she you have given me a treasure are any of your younger sisters out miss bennet ,Pride and Prejudice
yes my youngest is not sixteen perhaps she is full young to be much in company but really maam i think it would be very hard upon younger sisters that they should not have their share of society and amusement because the elder may not have the means or inclination to marry early the lastborn has as good a right to the pleasures of youth as the first and to be kept back on such a motive i think it would not be very likely to promote sisterly affection or delicacy of mind ,Pride and Prejudice
when the gentlemen had joined them and tea was over the cardtables were placed lady catherine sir william and mr and mrs collins sat down to quadrille and as miss de bourgh chose to play at cassino the two girls had the honour of assisting mrs jenkinson to make up her party their table was superlatively stupid scarcely a syllable was uttered that did not relate to the game except when mrs jenkinson expressed her fears of miss de bourghs being too hot or too cold or having too much or too little light a great deal more passed at the other table lady catherine was generally speakingstating the mistakes of the three others or relating some anecdote of herself mr collins was employed in agreeing to everything her ladyship said thanking her for every fish he won and apologising if he thought he won too many sir william did not say much he was storing his memory with anecdotes and noble names ,Pride and Prejudice
when lady catherine and her daughter had played as long as they chose the tables were broken up the carriage was offered to mrs collins gratefully accepted and immediately ordered the party then gathered round the fire to hear lady catherine determine what weather they were to have on the morrow from these instructions they were summoned by the arrival of the coach and with many speeches of thankfulness on mr collinss side and as many bows on sir williams they departed as soon as they had driven from the door elizabeth was called on by her cousin to give her opinion of all that she had seen at rosings which for charlottes sake she made more favourable than it really was but her commendation though costing her some trouble could by no means satisfy mr collins and he was very soon obliged to take her ladyships praise into his own hands ,Pride and Prejudice
sir william stayed only a week at hunsford but his visit was long enough to convince him of his daughters being most comfortably settled and of her possessing such a husband and such a neighbour as were not often met with while sir william was with them mr collins devoted his morning to driving him out in his gig and showing him the country but when he went away the whole family returned to their usual employments and elizabeth was thankful to find that they did not see more of her cousin by the alteration for the chief of the time between breakfast and dinner was now passed by him either at work in the garden or in reading and writing and looking out of the window in his own bookroom which fronted the road the room in which the ladies sat was backwards elizabeth had at first rather wondered that charlotte should not prefer the diningparlour for common use it was a better sized room and had a more pleasant aspect but she soon saw that her friend had an excellent reason for what she did for mr collins would undoubtedly have been much less in his own apartment had they sat in one equally lively and she gave charlotte credit for the arrangement ,Pride and Prejudice
from the drawingroom they could distinguish nothing in the lane and were indebted to mr collins for the knowledge of what carriages went along and how often especially miss de bourgh drove by in her phaeton which he never failed coming to inform them of though it happened almost every day she not unfrequently stopped at the parsonage and had a few minutes conversation with charlotte but was scarcely ever prevailed upon to get out ,Pride and Prejudice
very few days passed in which mr collins did not walk to rosings and not many in which his wife did not think it necessary to go likewise and till elizabeth recollected that there might be other family livings to be disposed of she could not understand the sacrifice of so many hours now and then they were honoured with a call from her ladyship and nothing escaped her observation that was passing in the room during these visits she examined into their employments looked at their work and advised them to do it differently found fault with the arrangement of the furniture or detected the housemaid in negligence and if she accepted any refreshment seemed to do it only for the sake of finding out that mrs collinss joints of meat were too large for her family ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth soon perceived that though this great lady was not in the commission of the peace of the county she was a most active magistrate in her own parish the minutest concerns of which were carried to her by mr collins and whenever any of the cottagers were disposed to be quarrelsome discontented or too poor she sallied forth into the village to settle their differences silence their complaints and scold them into harmony and plenty ,Pride and Prejudice
the entertainment of dining at rosings was repeated about twice a week and allowing for the loss of sir william and there being only one cardtable in the evening every such entertainment was the counterpart of the first their other engagements were few as the style of living in the neighbourhood in general was beyond mr collinss reach this however was no evil to elizabeth and upon the whole she spent her time comfortably enough there were halfhours of pleasant conversation with charlotte and the weather was so fine for the time of year that she had often great enjoyment out of doors her favourite walk and where she frequently went while the others were calling on lady catherine was along the open grove which edged that side of the park where there was a nice sheltered path which no one seemed to value but herself and where she felt beyond the reach of lady catherines curiosity ,Pride and Prejudice
in this quiet way the first fortnight of her visit soon passed away easter was approaching and the week preceding it was to bring an addition to the family at rosings which in so small a circle must be important elizabeth had heard soon after her arrival that mr darcy was expected there in the course of a few weeks and though there were not many of her acquaintances whom she did not prefer his coming would furnish one comparatively new to look at in their rosings parties and she might be amused in seeing how hopeless miss bingleys designs on him were by his behaviour to his cousin for whom he was evidently destined by lady catherine who talked of his coming with the greatest satisfaction spoke of him in terms of the highest admiration and seemed almost angry to find that he had already been frequently seen by miss lucas and herself ,Pride and Prejudice
his arrival was soon known at the parsonage for mr collins was walking the whole morning within view of the lodges opening into hunsford lane in order to have the earliest assurance of it and after making his bow as the carriage turned into the park hurried home with the great intelligence on the following morning he hastened to rosings to pay his respects there were two nephews of lady catherine to require them for mr darcy had brought with him a colonel fitzwilliam the younger son of his uncle lord  and to the great surprise of all the party when mr collins returned the gentlemen accompanied him charlotte had seen them from her husbands room crossing the road and immediately running into the other told the girls what an honour they might expect adding ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth had scarcely time to disclaim all right to the compliment before their approach was announced by the doorbell and shortly afterwards the three gentlemen entered the room colonel fitzwilliam who led the way was about thirty not handsome but in person and address most truly the gentleman mr darcy looked just as he had been used to look in hertfordshirepaid his compliments with his usual reserve to mrs collins and whatever might be his feelings toward her friend met her with every appearance of composure elizabeth merely curtseyed to him without saying a word ,Pride and Prejudice
colonel fitzwilliam entered into conversation directly with the readiness and ease of a wellbred man and talked very pleasantly but his cousin after having addressed a slight observation on the house and garden to mrs collins sat for some time without speaking to anybody at length however his civility was so far awakened as to enquire of elizabeth after the health of her family she answered him in the usual way and after a moments pause added ,Pride and Prejudice
she was perfectly sensible that he never had but she wished to see whether he would betray any consciousness of what had passed between the bingleys and jane and she thought he looked a little confused as he answered that he had never been so fortunate as to meet miss bennet the subject was pursued no farther and the gentlemen soon afterwards went away ,Pride and Prejudice
colonel fitzwilliams manners were very much admired at the parsonage and the ladies all felt that he must add considerably to the pleasures of their engagements at rosings it was some days however before they received any invitation thitherfor while there were visitors in the house they could not be necessary and it was not till easterday almost a week after the gentlemens arrival that they were honoured by such an attention and then they were merely asked on leaving church to come there in the evening for the last week they had seen very little of lady catherine or her daughter colonel fitzwilliam had called at the parsonage more than once during the time but mr darcy they had seen only at church ,Pride and Prejudice
the invitation was accepted of course and at a proper hour they joined the party in lady catherines drawingroom her ladyship received them civilly but it was plain that their company was by no means so acceptable as when she could get nobody else and she was in fact almost engrossed by her nephews speaking to them especially to darcy much more than to any other person in the room ,Pride and Prejudice
colonel fitzwilliam seemed really glad to see them anything was a welcome relief to him at rosings and mrs collinss pretty friend had moreover caught his fancy very much he now seated himself by her and talked so agreeably of kent and hertfordshire of travelling and staying at home of new books and music that elizabeth had never been half so well entertained in that room before and they conversed with so much spirit and flow as to draw the attention of lady catherine herself as well as of mr darcy his eyes had been soon and repeatedly turned towards them with a look of curiosity and that her ladyship after a while shared the feeling was more openly acknowledged for she did not scruple to call out ,Pride and Prejudice
of music then pray speak aloud it is of all subjects my delight i must have my share in the conversation if you are speaking of music there are few people in england i suppose who have more true enjoyment of music than myself or a better natural taste if i had ever learnt i should have been a great proficient and so would anne if her health had allowed her to apply i am confident that she would have performed delightfully how does georgiana get on darcy ,Pride and Prejudice
so much the better it cannot be done too much and when i next write to her i shall charge her not to neglect it on any account i often tell young ladies that no excellence in music is to be acquired without constant practice i have told miss bennet several times that she will never play really well unless she practises more and though mrs collins has no instrument she is very welcome as i have often told her to come to rosings every day and play on the pianoforte in mrs jenkinsons room she would be in nobodys way you know in that part of the house ,Pride and Prejudice
when coffee was over colonel fitzwilliam reminded elizabeth of having promised to play to him and she sat down directly to the instrument he drew a chair near her lady catherine listened to half a song and then talked as before to her other nephew till the latter walked away from her and making with his usual deliberation towards the pianoforte stationed himself so as to command a full view of the fair performers countenance elizabeth saw what he was doing and at the first convenient pause turned to him with an arch smile and said ,Pride and Prejudice
you mean to frighten me mr darcy by coming in all this state to hear me i will not be alarmed though your sister does play so well there is a stubbornness about me that never can bear to be frightened at the will of others my courage always rises at every attempt to intimidate me ,Pride and Prejudice
i shall not say you are mistaken he replied because you could not really believe me to entertain any design of alarming you and i have had the pleasure of your acquaintance long enough to know that you find great enjoyment in occasionally professing opinions which in fact are not your own ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth laughed heartily at this picture of herself and said to colonel fitzwilliam your cousin will give you a very pretty notion of me and teach you not to believe a word i say i am particularly unlucky in meeting with a person so able to expose my real character in a part of the world where i had hoped to pass myself off with some degree of credit indeed mr darcy it is very ungenerous in you to mention all that you knew to my disadvantage in hertfordshireand give me leave to say very impolitic toofor it is provoking me to retaliate and such things may come out as will shock your relations to hear ,Pride and Prejudice
you shall hear thenbut prepare yourself for something very dreadful the first time of my ever seeing him in hertfordshire you must know was at a balland at this ball what do you think he did he danced only four dances though gentlemen were scarce and to my certain knowledge more than one young lady was sitting down in want of a partner mr darcy you cannot deny the fact ,Pride and Prejudice
shall we ask your cousin the reason of this said elizabeth still addressing colonel fitzwilliam shall we ask him why a man of sense and education and who has lived in the world is ill qualified to recommend himself to strangers ,Pride and Prejudice
i certainly have not the talent which some people possess said darcy of conversing easily with those i have never seen before i cannot catch their tone of conversation or appear interested in their concerns as i often see done ,Pride and Prejudice
my fingers said elizabeth do not move over this instrument in the masterly manner which i see so many womens do they have not the same force or rapidity and do not produce the same expression but then i have always supposed it to be my own faultbecause i will not take the trouble of practising it is not that i do not believe my fingers as capable as any other womans of superior execution ,Pride and Prejudice
darcy smiled and said you are perfectly right you have employed your time much better no one admitted to the privilege of hearing you can think anything wanting we neither of us perform to strangers ,Pride and Prejudice
here they were interrupted by lady catherine who called out to know what they were talking of elizabeth immediately began playing again lady catherine approached and after listening for a few minutes said to darcy ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bennet would not play at all amiss if she practised more and could have the advantage of a london master she has a very good notion of fingering though her taste is not equal to annes anne would have been a delightful performer had her health allowed her to learn ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth looked at darcy to see how cordially he assented to his cousins praise but neither at that moment nor at any other could she discern any symptom of love and from the whole of his behaviour to miss de bourgh she derived this comfort for miss bingley that he might have been just as likely to marry her had she been his relation ,Pride and Prejudice
lady catherine continued her remarks on elizabeths performance mixing with them many instructions on execution and taste elizabeth received them with all the forbearance of civility and at the request of the gentlemen remained at the instrument till her ladyships carriage was ready to take them all home ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was sitting by herself the next morning and writing to jane while mrs collins and maria were gone on business into the village when she was startled by a ring at the door the certain signal of a visitor as she had heard no carriage she thought it not unlikely to be lady catherine and under that apprehension was putting away her halffinished letter that she might escape all impertinent questions when the door opened and to her very great surprise mr darcy and mr darcy only entered the room ,Pride and Prejudice
they then sat down and when her enquiries after rosings were made seemed in danger of sinking into total silence it was absolutely necessary therefore to think of something and in this emergence recollecting when she had seen him last in hertfordshire and feeling curious to know what he would say on the subject of their hasty departure she observed ,Pride and Prejudice
how very suddenly you all quitted netherfield last november mr darcy it must have been a most agreeable surprise to mr bingley to see you all after him so soon for if i recollect right he went but the day before he and his sisters were well i hope when you left london ,Pride and Prejudice
i have never heard him say so but it is probable that he may spend very little of his time there in the future he has many friends and is at a time of life when friends and engagements are continually increasing ,Pride and Prejudice
if he means to be but little at netherfield it would be better for the neighbourhood that he should give up the place entirely for then we might possibly get a settled family there but perhaps mr bingley did not take the house so much for the convenience of the neighbourhood as for his own and we must expect him to keep it or quit it on the same principle ,Pride and Prejudice
yes indeed his friends may well rejoice in his having met with one of the very few sensible women who would have accepted him or have made him happy if they had my friend has an excellent understandingthough i am not certain that i consider her marrying mr collins as the wisest thing she ever did she seems perfectly happy however and in a prudential light it is certainly a very good match for her ,Pride and Prejudice
i do not mean to say that a woman may not be settled too near her family the far and the near must be relative and depend on many varying circumstances where there is fortune to make the expenses of travelling unimportant distance becomes no evil but that is not the case here mr and mrs collins have a comfortable income but not such a one as will allow of frequent journeysand i am persuaded my friend would not call herself near her family under less than half the present distance ,Pride and Prejudice
a short dialogue on the subject of the country ensued on either side calm and conciseand soon put an end to by the entrance of charlotte and her sister just returned from her walk the ttette surprised them mr darcy related the mistake which had occasioned his intruding on miss bennet and after sitting a few minutes longer without saying much to anybody went away ,Pride and Prejudice
but when elizabeth told of his silence it did not seem very likely even to charlottes wishes to be the case and after various conjectures they could at last only suppose his visit to proceed from the difficulty of finding anything to do which was the more probable from the time of year all field sports were over within doors there was lady catherine books and a billiardtable but gentlemen cannot always be within doors and in the nearness of the parsonage or the pleasantness of the walk to it or of the people who lived in it the two cousins found a temptation from this period of walking thither almost every day they called at various times of the morning sometimes separately sometimes together and now and then accompanied by their aunt it was plain to them all that colonel fitzwilliam came because he had pleasure in their society a persuasion which of course recommended him still more and elizabeth was reminded by her own satisfaction in being with him as well as by his evident admiration of her of her former favourite george wickham and though in comparing them she saw there was less captivating softness in colonel fitzwilliams manners she believed he might have the best informed mind ,Pride and Prejudice
but why mr darcy came so often to the parsonage it was more difficult to understand it could not be for society as he frequently sat there ten minutes together without opening his lips and when he did speak it seemed the effect of necessity rather than of choicea sacrifice to propriety not a pleasure to himself he seldom appeared really animated mrs collins knew not what to make of him colonel fitzwilliams occasionally laughing at his stupidity proved that he was generally different which her own knowledge of him could not have told her and as she would liked to have believed this change the effect of love and the object of that love her friend eliza she set herself seriously to work to find it out she watched him whenever they were at rosings and whenever he came to hunsford but without much success he certainly looked at her friend a great deal but the expression of that look was disputable it was an earnest steadfast gaze but she often doubted whether there were much admiration in it and sometimes it seemed nothing but absence of mind ,Pride and Prejudice
she had once or twice suggested to elizabeth the possibility of his being partial to her but elizabeth always laughed at the idea and mrs collins did not think it right to press the subject from the danger of raising expectations which might only end in disappointment for in her opinion it admitted not of a doubt that all her friends dislike would vanish if she could suppose him to be in her power ,Pride and Prejudice
in her kind schemes for elizabeth she sometimes planned her marrying colonel fitzwilliam he was beyond comparison the most pleasant man he certainly admired her and his situation in life was most eligible but to counterbalance these advantages mr darcy had considerable patronage in the church and his cousin could have none at all ,Pride and Prejudice
more than once did elizabeth in her ramble within the park unexpectedly meet mr darcy she felt all the perverseness of the mischance that should bring him where no one else was brought and to prevent its ever happening again took care to inform him at first that it was a favourite haunt of hers how it could occur a second time therefore was very odd yet it did and even a third it seemed like wilful illnature or a voluntary penance for on these occasions it was not merely a few formal enquiries and an awkward pause and then away but he actually thought it necessary to turn back and walk with her he never said a great deal nor did she give herself the trouble of talking or of listening much but it struck her in the course of their third rencontre that he was asking some odd unconnected questionsabout her pleasure in being at hunsford her love of solitary walks and her opinion of mr and mrs collinss happiness and that in speaking of rosings and her not perfectly understanding the house he seemed to expect that whenever she came into kent again she would be staying there too his words seemed to imply it could he have colonel fitzwilliam in his thoughts she supposed if he meant anything he must mean an allusion to what might arise in that quarter it distressed her a little and she was quite glad to find herself at the gate in the pales opposite the parsonage ,Pride and Prejudice
she was engaged one day as she walked in perusing janes last letter and dwelling on some passages which proved that jane had not written in spirits when instead of being again surprised by mr darcy she saw on looking up that colonel fitzwilliam was meeting her putting away the letter immediately and forcing a smile she said ,Pride and Prejudice
and if not able to please himself in the arrangement he has at least pleasure in the great power of choice i do not know anybody who seems more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than mr darcy ,Pride and Prejudice
he likes to have his own way very well replied colonel fitzwilliam but so we all do it is only that he has better means of having it than many others because he is rich and many others are poor i speak feelingly a younger son you know must be inured to selfdenial and dependence ,Pride and Prejudice
in my opinion the younger son of an earl can know very little of either now seriously what have you ever known of selfdenial and dependence when have you been prevented by want of money from going wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for ,Pride and Prejudice
these are home questionsand perhaps i cannot say that i have experienced many hardships of that nature but in matters of greater weight i may suffer from want of money younger sons cannot marry where they like ,Pride and Prejudice
is this thought elizabeth meant for me and she coloured at the idea but recovering herself said in a lively tone and pray what is the usual price of an earls younger son unless the elder brother is very sickly i suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds ,Pride and Prejudice
i imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of having someone at his disposal i wonder he does not marry to secure a lasting convenience of that kind but perhaps his sister does as well for the present and as she is under his sole care he may do what he likes with her ,Pride and Prejudice
are you indeed and pray what sort of guardians do you make does your charge give you much trouble young ladies of her age are sometimes a little difficult to manage and if she has the true darcy spirit she may like to have her own way ,Pride and Prejudice
as she spoke she observed him looking at her earnestly and the manner in which he immediately asked her why she supposed miss darcy likely to give them any uneasiness convinced her that she had somehow or other got pretty near the truth she directly replied ,Pride and Prejudice
you need not be frightened i never heard any harm of her and i dare say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world she is a very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance mrs hurst and miss bingley i think i have heard you say that you know them ,Pride and Prejudice
care of him yes i really believe darcy does take care of him in those points where he most wants care from something that he told me in our journey hither i have reason to think bingley very much indebted to him but i ought to beg his pardon for i have no right to suppose that bingley was the person meant it was all conjecture ,Pride and Prejudice
and remember that i have not much reason for supposing it to be bingley what he told me was merely this that he congratulated himself on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most imprudent marriage but without mentioning names or any other particulars and i only suspected it to be bingley from believing him the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort and from knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer ,Pride and Prejudice
i do not see what right mr darcy had to decide on the propriety of his friends inclination or why upon his own judgement alone he was to determine and direct in what manner his friend was to be happy but she continued recollecting herself as we know none of the particulars it is not fair to condemn him it is not to be supposed that there was much affection in the case ,Pride and Prejudice
this was spoken jestingly but it appeared to her so just a picture of mr darcy that she would not trust herself with an answer and therefore abruptly changing the conversation talked on indifferent matters until they reached the parsonage there shut into her own room as soon as their visitor left them she could think without interruption of all that she had heard it was not to be supposed that any other people could be meant than those with whom she was connected there could not exist in the world two men over whom mr darcy could have such boundless influence that he had been concerned in the measures taken to separate bingley and jane she had never doubted but she had always attributed to miss bingley the principal design and arrangement of them if his own vanity however did not mislead him he was the cause his pride and caprice were the cause of all that jane had suffered and still continued to suffer he had ruined for a while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate generous heart in the world and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have inflicted ,Pride and Prejudice
there were some very strong objections against the lady were colonel fitzwilliams words and those strong objections probably were her having one uncle who was a country attorney and another who was in business in london ,Pride and Prejudice
to jane herself she exclaimed there could be no possibility of objection all loveliness and goodness as she isher understanding excellent her mind improved and her manners captivating neither could anything be urged against my father who though with some peculiarities has abilities mr darcy himself need not disdain and respectability which he will probably never reach when she thought of her mother her confidence gave way a little but she would not allow that any objections there had material weight with mr darcy whose pride she was convinced would receive a deeper wound from the want of importance in his friends connections than from their want of sense and she was quite decided at last that he had been partly governed by this worst kind of pride and partly by the wish of retaining mr bingley for his sister ,Pride and Prejudice
the agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a headache and it grew so much worse towards the evening that added to her unwillingness to see mr darcy it determined her not to attend her cousins to rosings where they were engaged to drink tea mrs collins seeing that she was really unwell did not press her to go and as much as possible prevented her husband from pressing her but mr collins could not conceal his apprehension of lady catherines being rather displeased by her staying at home ,Pride and Prejudice
when they were gone elizabeth as if intending to exasperate herself as much as possible against mr darcy chose for her employment the examination of all the letters which jane had written to her since her being in kent they contained no actual complaint nor was there any revival of past occurrences or any communication of present suffering but in all and in almost every line of each there was a want of that cheerfulness which had been used to characterise her style and which proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself and kindly disposed towards everyone had been scarcely ever clouded elizabeth noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness with an attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal mr darcys shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a keener sense of her sisters sufferings it was some consolation to think that his visit to rosings was to end on the day after the nextand a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be with jane again and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her spirits by all that affection could do ,Pride and Prejudice
she could not think of darcys leaving kent without remembering that his cousin was to go with him but colonel fitzwilliam had made it clear that he had no intentions at all and agreeable as he was she did not mean to be unhappy about him ,Pride and Prejudice
while settling this point she was suddenly roused by the sound of the doorbell and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its being colonel fitzwilliam himself who had once before called late in the evening and might now come to enquire particularly after her but this idea was soon banished and her spirits were very differently affected when to her utter amazement she saw mr darcy walk into the room in an hurried manner he immediately began an enquiry after her health imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better she answered him with cold civility he sat down for a few moments and then getting up walked about the room elizabeth was surprised but said not a word after a silence of several minutes he came towards her in an agitated manner and thus began ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths astonishment was beyond expression she stared coloured doubted and was silent this he considered sufficient encouragement and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately followed he spoke well but there were feelings besides those of the heart to be detailed and he was not more eloquent on the subject of tenderness than of pride his sense of her inferiorityof its being a degradationof the family obstacles which had always opposed to inclination were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the consequence he was wounding but was very unlikely to recommend his suit ,Pride and Prejudice
in spite of her deeplyrooted dislike she could not be insensible to the compliment of such a mans affection and though her intentions did not vary for an instant she was at first sorry for the pain he was to receive till roused to resentment by his subsequent language she lost all compassion in anger she tried however to compose herself to answer him with patience when he should have done he concluded with representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer and with expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of his hand as he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a favourable answer he spoke of apprehension and anxiety but his countenance expressed real security such a circumstance could only exasperate farther and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks and she said ,Pride and Prejudice
in such cases as this it is i believe the established mode to express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed however unequally they may be returned it is natural that obligation should be felt and if i could feel gratitude i would now thank you but i cannoti have never desired your good opinion and you have certainly bestowed it most unwillingly i am sorry to have occasioned pain to anyone it has been most unconsciously done however and i hope will be of short duration the feelings which you tell me have long prevented the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in overcoming it after this explanation ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy who was leaning against the mantelpiece with his eyes fixed on her face seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than surprise his complexion became pale with anger and the disturbance of his mind was visible in every feature he was struggling for the appearance of composure and would not open his lips till he believed himself to have attained it the pause was to elizabeths feelings dreadful at length with a voice of forced calmness he said ,Pride and Prejudice
and this is all the reply which i am to have the honour of expecting i might perhaps wish to be informed why with so little endeavour at civility i am thus rejected but it is of small importance ,Pride and Prejudice
i might as well enquire replied she why with so evident a desire of offending and insulting me you chose to tell me that you liked me against your will against your reason and even against your character was not this some excuse for incivility if i was uncivil but i have other provocations you know i have had not my feelings decided against youhad they been indifferent or had they even been favourable do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept the man who has been the means of ruining perhaps for ever the happiness of a most beloved sister ,Pride and Prejudice
i have every reason in the world to think ill of you no motive can excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted there you dare not you cannot deny that you have been the principal if not the only means of dividing them from each otherof exposing one to the censure of the world for caprice and instability and the other to its derision for disappointed hopes and involving them both in misery of the acutest kind ,Pride and Prejudice
she paused and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse he even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity ,Pride and Prejudice
with assumed tranquillity he then replied i have no wish of denying that i did everything in my power to separate my friend from your sister or that i rejoice in my success towards him i have been kinder than towards myself ,Pride and Prejudice
but it is not merely this affair she continued on which my dislike is founded long before it had taken place my opinion of you was decided your character was unfolded in the recital which i received many months ago from mr wickham on this subject what can you have to say in what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others ,Pride and Prejudice
and of your infliction cried elizabeth with energy you have reduced him to his present state of povertycomparative poverty you have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed for him you have deprived the best years of his life of that independence which was no less his due than his desert you have done all this and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortune with contempt and ridicule ,Pride and Prejudice
and this cried darcy as he walked with quick steps across the room is your opinion of me this is the estimation in which you hold me i thank you for explaining it so fully my faults according to this calculation are heavy indeed but perhaps added he stopping in his walk and turning towards her these offenses might have been overlooked had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design these bitter accusations might have been suppressed had i with greater policy concealed my struggles and flattered you into the belief of my being impelled by unqualified unalloyed inclination by reason by reflection by everything but disguise of every sort is my abhorrence nor am i ashamed of the feelings i related they were natural and just could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your connectionsto congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own ,Pride and Prejudice
you are mistaken mr darcy if you suppose that the mode of your declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the concern which i might have felt in refusing you had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner ,Pride and Prejudice
from the very beginningfrom the first moment i may almost sayof my acquaintance with you your manners impressing me with the fullest belief of your arrogance your conceit and your selfish disdain of the feelings of others were such as to form the groundwork of disapprobation on which succeeding events have built so immovable a dislike and i had not known you a month before i felt that you were the last man in the world whom i could ever be prevailed on to marry ,Pride and Prejudice
you have said quite enough madam i perfectly comprehend your feelings and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been forgive me for having taken up so much of your time and accept my best wishes for your health and happiness ,Pride and Prejudice
the tumult of her mind was now painfully great she knew not how to support herself and from actual weakness sat down and cried for halfanhour her astonishment as she reflected on what had passed was increased by every review of it that she should receive an offer of marriage from mr darcy that he should have been in love with her for so many months so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections which had made him prevent his friends marrying her sister and which must appear at least with equal force in his own casewas almost incredible it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong an affection but his pride his abominable pridehis shameless avowal of what he had done with respect to janehis unpardonable assurance in acknowledging though he could not justify it and the unfeeling manner in which he had mentioned mr wickham his cruelty towards whom he had not attempted to deny soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his attachment had for a moment excited she continued in very agitated reflections till the sound of lady catherines carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter charlottes observation and hurried her away to her room ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations which had at length closed her eyes she could not yet recover from the surprise of what had happened it was impossible to think of anything else and totally indisposed for employment she resolved soon after breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise she was proceeding directly to her favourite walk when the recollection of mr darcys sometimes coming there stopped her and instead of entering the park she turned up the lane which led farther from the turnpikeroad the park paling was still the boundary on one side and she soon passed one of the gates into the ground ,Pride and Prejudice
after walking two or three times along that part of the lane she was tempted by the pleasantness of the morning to stop at the gates and look into the park the five weeks which she had now passed in kent had made a great difference in the country and every day was adding to the verdure of the early trees she was on the point of continuing her walk when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove which edged the park he was moving that way and fearful of its being mr darcy she was directly retreating but the person who advanced was now near enough to see her and stepping forward with eagerness pronounced her name she had turned away but on hearing herself called though in a voice which proved it to be mr darcy she moved again towards the gate he had by that time reached it also and holding out a letter which she instinctively took said with a look of haughty composure i have been walking in the grove some time in the hope of meeting you will you do me the honour of reading that letter and then with a slight bow turned again into the plantation and was soon out of sight ,Pride and Prejudice
with no expectation of pleasure but with the strongest curiosity elizabeth opened the letter and to her still increasing wonder perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letterpaper written quite through in a very close hand the envelope itself was likewise full pursuing her way along the lane she then began it it was dated from rosings at eight oclock in the morning and was as follows ,Pride and Prejudice
be not alarmed madam on receiving this letter by the apprehension of its containing any repetition of those sentiments or renewal of those offers which were last night so disgusting to you i write without any intention of paining you or humbling myself by dwelling on wishes which for the happiness of both cannot be too soon forgotten and the effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion should have been spared had not my character required it to be written and read you must therefore pardon the freedom with which i demand your attention your feelings i know will bestow it unwillingly but i demand it of your justice ,Pride and Prejudice
two offenses of a very different nature and by no means of equal magnitude you last night laid to my charge the first mentioned was that regardless of the sentiments of either i had detached mr bingley from your sister and the other that i had in defiance of various claims in defiance of honour and humanity ruined the immediate prosperity and blasted the prospects of mr wickham wilfully and wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth the acknowledged favourite of my father a young man who had scarcely any other dependence than on our patronage and who had been brought up to expect its exertion would be a depravity to which the separation of two young persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks could bear no comparison but from the severity of that blame which was last night so liberally bestowed respecting each circumstance i shall hope to be in the future secured when the following account of my actions and their motives has been read if in the explanation of them which is due to myself i am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be offensive to yours i can only say that i am sorry the necessity must be obeyed and further apology would be absurd ,Pride and Prejudice
i had not been long in hertfordshire before i saw in common with others that bingley preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country but it was not till the evening of the dance at netherfield that i had any apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment i had often seen him in love before at that ball while i had the honour of dancing with you i was first made acquainted by sir william lucass accidental information that bingleys attentions to your sister had given rise to a general expectation of their marriage he spoke of it as a certain event of which the time alone could be undecided from that moment i observed my friends behaviour attentively and i could then perceive that his partiality for miss bennet was beyond what i had ever witnessed in him your sister i also watched her look and manners were open cheerful and engaging as ever but without any symptom of peculiar regard and i remained convinced from the evenings scrutiny that though she received his attentions with pleasure she did not invite them by any participation of sentiment if you have not been mistaken here i must have been in error your superior knowledge of your sister must make the latter probable if it be so if i have been misled by such error to inflict pain on her your resentment has not been unreasonable but i shall not scruple to assert that the serenity of your sisters countenance and air was such as might have given the most acute observer a conviction that however amiable her temper her heart was not likely to be easily touched that i was desirous of believing her indifferent is certainbut i will venture to say that my investigation and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or fears i did not believe her to be indifferent because i wished it i believed it on impartial conviction as truly as i wished it in reason my objections to the marriage were not merely those which i last night acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside in my own case the want of connection could not be so great an evil to my friend as to me but there were other causes of repugnance causes which though still existing and existing to an equal degree in both instances i had myself endeavoured to forget because they were not immediately before me these causes must be stated though briefly the situation of your mothers family though objectionable was nothing in comparison to that total want of propriety so frequently so almost uniformly betrayed by herself by your three younger sisters and occasionally even by your father pardon me it pains me to offend you but amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations and your displeasure at this representation of them let it give you consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on you and your elder sister than it is honourable to the sense and disposition of both i will only say farther that from what passed that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed and every inducement heightened which could have led me before to preserve my friend from what i esteemed a most unhappy connection he left netherfield for london on the day following as you i am certain remember with the design of soon returning ,Pride and Prejudice
the part which i acted is now to be explained his sisters uneasiness had been equally excited with my own our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered and alike sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother we shortly resolved on joining him directly in london we accordingly wentand there i readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my friend the certain evils of such a choice i described and enforced them earnestly but however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed his determination i do not suppose that it would ultimately have prevented the marriage had it not been seconded by the assurance that i hesitated not in giving of your sisters indifference he had before believed her to return his affection with sincere if not with equal regard but bingley has great natural modesty with a stronger dependence on my judgement than on his own to convince him therefore that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point to persuade him against returning into hertfordshire when that conviction had been given was scarcely the work of a moment i cannot blame myself for having done thus much there is but one part of my conduct in the whole affair on which i do not reflect with satisfaction it is that i condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him your sisters being in town i knew it myself as it was known to miss bingley but her brother is even yet ignorant of it that they might have met without ill consequence is perhaps probable but his regard did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some danger perhaps this concealment this disguise was beneath me it is done however and it was done for the best on this subject i have nothing more to say no other apology to offer if i have wounded your sisters feelings it was unknowingly done and though the motives which governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient i have not yet learnt to condemn them ,Pride and Prejudice
with respect to that other more weighty accusation of having injured mr wickham i can only refute it by laying before you the whole of his connection with my family of what he has particularly accused me i am ignorant but of the truth of what i shall relate i can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity ,Pride and Prejudice
mr wickham is the son of a very respectable man who had for many years the management of all the pemberley estates and whose good conduct in the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service to him and on george wickham who was his godson his kindness was therefore liberally bestowed my father supported him at school and afterwards at cambridgemost important assistance as his own father always poor from the extravagance of his wife would have been unable to give him a gentlemans education my father was not only fond of this young mans society whose manners were always engaging he had also the highest opinion of him and hoping the church would be his profession intended to provide for him in it as for myself it is many many years since i first began to think of him in a very different manner the vicious propensitiesthe want of principle which he was careful to guard from the knowledge of his best friend could not escape the observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself and who had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments which mr darcy could not have here again i shall give you painto what degree you only can tell but whatever may be the sentiments which mr wickham has created a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding his real characterit adds even another motive ,Pride and Prejudice
my excellent father died about five years ago and his attachment to mr wickham was to the last so steady that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might allowand if he took orders desired that a valuable family living might be his as soon as it became vacant there was also a legacy of one thousand pounds his own father did not long survive mine and within half a year from these events mr wickham wrote to inform me that having finally resolved against taking orders he hoped i should not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate pecuniary advantage in lieu of the preferment by which he could not be benefited he had some intention he added of studying law and i must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very insufficient support therein i rather wished than believed him to be sincere but at any rate was perfectly ready to accede to his proposal i knew that mr wickham ought not to be a clergyman the business was therefore soon settledhe resigned all claim to assistance in the church were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to receive it and accepted in return three thousand pounds all connection between us seemed now dissolved i thought too ill of him to invite him to pemberley or admit his society in town in town i believe he chiefly lived but his studying the law was a mere pretence and being now free from all restraint his life was a life of idleness and dissipation for about three years i heard little of him but on the decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him he applied to me again by letter for the presentation his circumstances he assured me and i had no difficulty in believing it were exceedingly bad he had found the law a most unprofitable study and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained if i would present him to the living in questionof which he trusted there could be little doubt as he was well assured that i had no other person to provide for and i could not have forgotten my revered fathers intentions you will hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty or for resisting every repetition to it his resentment was in proportion to the distress of his circumstancesand he was doubtless as violent in his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself after this period every appearance of acquaintance was dropped how he lived i know not but last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my notice ,Pride and Prejudice
i must now mention a circumstance which i would wish to forget myself and which no obligation less than the present should induce me to unfold to any human being having said thus much i feel no doubt of your secrecy my sister who is more than ten years my junior was left to the guardianship of my mothers nephew colonel fitzwilliam and myself about a year ago she was taken from school and an establishment formed for her in london and last summer she went with the lady who presided over it to ramsgate and thither also went mr wickham undoubtedly by design for there proved to have been a prior acquaintance between him and mrs younge in whose character we were most unhappily deceived and by her connivance and aid he so far recommended himself to georgiana whose affectionate heart retained a strong impression of his kindness to her as a child that she was persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement she was then but fifteen which must be her excuse and after stating her imprudence i am happy to add that i owed the knowledge of it to herself i joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended elopement and then georgiana unable to support the idea of grieving and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father acknowledged the whole to me you may imagine what i felt and how i acted regard for my sisters credit and feelings prevented any public exposure but i wrote to mr wickham who left the place immediately and mrs younge was of course removed from her charge mr wickhams chief object was unquestionably my sisters fortune which is thirty thousand pounds but i cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging himself on me was a strong inducement his revenge would have been complete indeed ,Pride and Prejudice
this madam is a faithful narrative of every event in which we have been concerned together and if you do not absolutely reject it as false you will i hope acquit me henceforth of cruelty towards mr wickham i know not in what manner under what form of falsehood he had imposed on you but his success is not perhaps to be wondered at ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning either detection could not be in your power and suspicion certainly not in your inclination ,Pride and Prejudice
you may possibly wonder why all this was not told you last night but i was not then master enough of myself to know what could or ought to be revealed for the truth of everything here related i can appeal more particularly to the testimony of colonel fitzwilliam who from our near relationship and constant intimacy and still more as one of the executors of my fathers will has been unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions if your abhorrence of me should make my assertions valueless you cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin and that there may be the possibility of consulting him i shall endeavour to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the course of the morning i will only add god bless you ,Pride and Prejudice
if elizabeth when mr darcy gave her the letter did not expect it to contain a renewal of his offers she had formed no expectation at all of its contents but such as they were it may well be supposed how eagerly she went through them and what a contrariety of emotion they excited her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined with amazement did she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power and steadfastly was she persuaded that he could have no explanation to give which a just sense of shame would not conceal with a strong prejudice against everything he might say she began his account of what had happened at netherfield she read with an eagerness which hardly left her power of comprehension and from impatience of knowing what the next sentence might bring was incapable of attending to the sense of the one before her eyes his belief of her sisters insensibility she instantly resolved to be false and his account of the real the worst objections to the match made her too angry to have any wish of doing him justice he expressed no regret for what he had done which satisfied her his style was not penitent but haughty it was all pride and insolence ,Pride and Prejudice
but when this subject was succeeded by his account of mr wickhamwhen she read with somewhat clearer attention a relation of events which if true must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth and which bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himselfher feelings were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition astonishment apprehension and even horror oppressed her she wished to discredit it entirely repeatedly exclaiming this must be false this cannot be this must be the grossest falsehoodand when she had gone through the whole letter though scarcely knowing anything of the last page or two put it hastily away protesting that she would not regard it that she would never look in it again ,Pride and Prejudice
in this perturbed state of mind with thoughts that could rest on nothing she walked on but it would not do in half a minute the letter was unfolded again and collecting herself as well as she could she again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to wickham and commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence the account of his connection with the pemberley family was exactly what he had related himself and the kindness of the late mr darcy though she had not before known its extent agreed equally well with his own words so far each recital confirmed the other but when she came to the will the difference was great what wickham had said of the living was fresh in her memory and as she recalled his very words it was impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the other and for a few moments she flattered herself that her wishes did not err but when she read and reread with the closest attention the particulars immediately following of wickhams resigning all pretensions to the living of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three thousand pounds again was she forced to hesitate she put down the letter weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be impartialitydeliberated on the probability of each statementbut with little success on both sides it was only assertion again she read on but every line proved more clearly that the affair which she had believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to render mr darcys conduct in it less than infamous was capable of a turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole ,Pride and Prejudice
the extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay at mr wickhams charge exceedingly shocked her the more so as she could bring no proof of its injustice she had never heard of him before his entrance into the shire militia in which he had engaged at the persuasion of the young man who on meeting him accidentally in town had there renewed a slight acquaintance of his former way of life nothing had been known in hertfordshire but what he told himself as to his real character had information been in her power she had never felt a wish of enquiring his countenance voice and manner had established him at once in the possession of every virtue she tried to recollect some instance of goodness some distinguished trait of integrity or benevolence that might rescue him from the attacks of mr darcy or at least by the predominance of virtue atone for those casual errors under which she would endeavour to class what mr darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years continuance but no such recollection befriended her she could see him instantly before her in every charm of air and address but she could remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the neighbourhood and the regard which his social powers had gained him in the mess after pausing on this point a considerable while she once more continued to read but alas the story which followed of his designs on miss darcy received some confirmation from what had passed between colonel fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before and at last she was referred for the truth of every particular to colonel fitzwilliam himselffrom whom she had previously received the information of his near concern in all his cousins affairs and whose character she had no reason to question at one time she had almost resolved on applying to him but the idea was checked by the awkwardness of the application and at length wholly banished by the conviction that mr darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal if he had not been well assured of his cousins corroboration ,Pride and Prejudice
she perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation between wickham and herself in their first evening at mr phillipss many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory she was now struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger and wondered it had escaped her before she saw the indelicacy of putting himself forward as he had done and the inconsistency of his professions with his conduct she remembered that he had boasted of having no fear of seeing mr darcythat mr darcy might leave the country but that he should stand his ground yet he had avoided the netherfield ball the very next week she remembered also that till the netherfield family had quitted the country he had told his story to no one but herself but that after their removal it had been everywhere discussed that he had then no reserves no scruples in sinking mr darcys character though he had assured her that respect for the father would always prevent his exposing the son ,Pride and Prejudice
how differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned his attentions to miss king were now the consequence of views solely and hatefully mercenary and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer the moderation of his wishes but his eagerness to grasp at anything his behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive he had either been deceived with regard to her fortune or had been gratifying his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most incautiously shown every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter and fainter and in farther justification of mr darcy she could not but allow that mr bingley when questioned by jane had long ago asserted his blamelessness in the affair that proud and repulsive as were his manners she had never in the whole course of their acquaintancean acquaintance which had latterly brought them much together and given her a sort of intimacy with his waysseen anything that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjustanything that spoke him of irreligious or immoral habits that among his own connections he was esteemed and valuedthat even wickham had allowed him merit as a brother and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling that had his actions been what mr wickham represented them so gross a violation of everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world and that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man as mr bingley was incomprehensible ,Pride and Prejudice
how despicably i have acted she cried i who have prided myself on my discernment i who have valued myself on my abilities who have often disdained the generous candour of my sister and gratified my vanity in useless or blameable mistrust how humiliating is this discovery yet how just a humiliation had i been in love i could not have been more wretchedly blind but vanity not love has been my folly pleased with the preference of one and offended by the neglect of the other on the very beginning of our acquaintance i have courted prepossession and ignorance and driven reason away where either were concerned till this moment i never knew myself ,Pride and Prejudice
from herself to janefrom jane to bingley her thoughts were in a line which soon brought to her recollection that mr darcys explanation there had appeared very insufficient and she read it again widely different was the effect of a second perusal how could she deny that credit to his assertions in one instance which she had been obliged to give in the other he declared himself to be totally unsuspicious of her sisters attachment and she could not help remembering what charlottes opinion had always been neither could she deny the justice of his description of jane she felt that janes feelings though fervent were little displayed and that there was a constant complacency in her air and manner not often united with great sensibility ,Pride and Prejudice
when she came to that part of the letter in which her family were mentioned in terms of such mortifying yet merited reproach her sense of shame was severe the justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the netherfield ball and as confirming all his first disapprobation could not have made a stronger impression on his mind than on hers ,Pride and Prejudice
the compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt it soothed but it could not console her for the contempt which had thus been selfattracted by the rest of her family and as she considered that janes disappointment had in fact been the work of her nearest relations and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt by such impropriety of conduct she felt depressed beyond anything she had ever known before ,Pride and Prejudice
after wandering along the lane for two hours giving way to every variety of thoughtreconsidering events determining probabilities and reconciling herself as well as she could to a change so sudden and so important fatigue and a recollection of her long absence made her at length return home and she entered the house with the wish of appearing cheerful as usual and the resolution of repressing such reflections as must make her unfit for conversation ,Pride and Prejudice
she was immediately told that the two gentlemen from rosings had each called during her absence mr darcy only for a few minutes to take leavebut that colonel fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least an hour hoping for her return and almost resolving to walk after her till she could be found elizabeth could but just affect concern in missing him she really rejoiced at it colonel fitzwilliam was no longer an object she could think only of her letter ,Pride and Prejudice
the two gentlemen left rosings the next morning and mr collins having been in waiting near the lodges to make them his parting obeisance was able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very good health and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected after the melancholy scene so lately gone through at rosings to rosings he then hastened to console lady catherine and her daughter and on his return brought back with great satisfaction a message from her ladyship importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of having them all to dine with her ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth could not see lady catherine without recollecting that had she chosen it she might by this time have been presented to her as her future niece nor could she think without a smile of what her ladyships indignation would have been what would she have said how would she have behaved were questions with which she amused herself ,Pride and Prejudice
their first subject was the diminution of the rosings party i assure you i feel it exceedingly said lady catherine i believe no one feels the loss of friends so much as i do but i am particularly attached to these young men and know them to be so much attached to me they were excessively sorry to go but so they always are the dear colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last but darcy seemed to feel it most acutely more i think than last year his attachment to rosings certainly increases ,Pride and Prejudice
lady catherine observed after dinner that miss bennet seemed out of spirits and immediately accounting for it herself by supposing that she did not like to go home again so soon she added ,Pride and Prejudice
why at that rate you will have been here only six weeks i expected you to stay two months i told mrs collins so before you came there can be no occasion for your going so soon mrs bennet could certainly spare you for another fortnight ,Pride and Prejudice
oh your father of course may spare you if your mother can daughters are never of so much consequence to a father and if you will stay another month complete it will be in my power to take one of you as far as london for i am going there early in june for a week and as dawson does not object to the barouchebox there will be very good room for one of youand indeed if the weather should happen to be cool i should not object to taking you both as you are neither of you large ,Pride and Prejudice
lady catherine seemed resigned mrs collins you must send a servant with them you know i always speak my mind and i cannot bear the idea of two young women travelling post by themselves it is highly improper you must contrive to send somebody i have the greatest dislike in the world to that sort of thing young women should always be properly guarded and attended according to their situation in life when my niece georgiana went to ramsgate last summer i made a point of her having two menservants go with her miss darcy the daughter of mr darcy of pemberley and lady anne could not have appeared with propriety in a different manner i am excessively attentive to all those things you must send john with the young ladies mrs collins i am glad it occurred to me to mention it for it would really be discreditable to you to let them go alone ,Pride and Prejudice
oh your uncle he keeps a manservant does he i am very glad you have somebody who thinks of these things where shall you change horses oh bromley of course if you mention my name at the bell you will be attended to ,Pride and Prejudice
lady catherine had many other questions to ask respecting their journey and as she did not answer them all herself attention was necessary which elizabeth believed to be lucky for her or with a mind so occupied she might have forgotten where she was reflection must be reserved for solitary hours whenever she was alone she gave way to it as the greatest relief and not a day went by without a solitary walk in which she might indulge in all the delight of unpleasant recollections ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcys letter she was in a fair way of soon knowing by heart she studied every sentence and her feelings towards its writer were at times widely different when she remembered the style of his address she was still full of indignation but when she considered how unjustly she had condemned and upbraided him her anger was turned against herself and his disappointed feelings became the object of compassion his attachment excited gratitude his general character respect but she could not approve him nor could she for a moment repent her refusal or feel the slightest inclination ever to see him again in her own past behaviour there was a constant source of vexation and regret and in the unhappy defects of her family a subject of yet heavier chagrin they were hopeless of remedy her father contented with laughing at them would never exert himself to restrain the wild giddiness of his youngest daughters and her mother with manners so far from right herself was entirely insensible of the evil elizabeth had frequently united with jane in an endeavour to check the imprudence of catherine and lydia but while they were supported by their mothers indulgence what chance could there be of improvement catherine weakspirited irritable and completely under lydias guidance had been always affronted by their advice and lydia selfwilled and careless would scarcely give them a hearing they were ignorant idle and vain while there was an officer in meryton they would flirt with him and while meryton was within a walk of longbourn they would be going there forever ,Pride and Prejudice
anxiety on janes behalf was another prevailing concern and mr darcys explanation by restoring bingley to all her former good opinion heightened the sense of what jane had lost his affection was proved to have been sincere and his conduct cleared of all blame unless any could attach to the implicitness of his confidence in his friend how grievous then was the thought that of a situation so desirable in every respect so replete with advantage so promising for happiness jane had been deprived by the folly and indecorum of her own family ,Pride and Prejudice
when to these recollections was added the development of wickhams character it may be easily believed that the happy spirits which had seldom been depressed before were now so much affected as to make it almost impossible for her to appear tolerably cheerful ,Pride and Prejudice
their engagements at rosings were as frequent during the last week of her stay as they had been at first the very last evening was spent there and her ladyship again enquired minutely into the particulars of their journey gave them directions as to the best method of packing and was so urgent on the necessity of placing gowns in the only right way that maria thought herself obliged on her return to undo all the work of the morning and pack her trunk afresh ,Pride and Prejudice
when they parted lady catherine with great condescension wished them a good journey and invited them to come to hunsford again next year and miss de bourgh exerted herself so far as to curtsey and hold out her hand to both ,Pride and Prejudice
on saturday morning elizabeth and mr collins met for breakfast a few minutes before the others appeared and he took the opportunity of paying the parting civilities which he deemed indispensably necessary ,Pride and Prejudice
i know not miss elizabeth said he whether mrs collins has yet expressed her sense of your kindness in coming to us but i am very certain you will not leave the house without receiving her thanks for it the favour of your company has been much felt i assure you we know how little there is to tempt anyone to our humble abode our plain manner of living our small rooms and few domestics and the little we see of the world must make hunsford extremely dull to a young lady like yourself but i hope you will believe us grateful for the condescension and that we have done everything in our power to prevent your spending your time unpleasantly ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was eager with her thanks and assurances of happiness she had spent six weeks with great enjoyment and the pleasure of being with charlotte and the kind attentions she had received must make her feel the obliged mr collins was gratified and with a more smiling solemnity replied ,Pride and Prejudice
it gives me great pleasure to hear that you have passed your time not disagreeably we have certainly done our best and most fortunately having it in our power to introduce you to very superior society and from our connection with rosings the frequent means of varying the humble home scene i think we may flatter ourselves that your hunsford visit cannot have been entirely irksome our situation with regard to lady catherines family is indeed the sort of extraordinary advantage and blessing which few can boast you see on what a footing we are you see how continually we are engaged there in truth i must acknowledge that with all the disadvantages of this humble parsonage i should not think anyone abiding in it an object of compassion while they are sharers of our intimacy at rosings ,Pride and Prejudice
you may in fact carry a very favourable report of us into hertfordshire my dear cousin i flatter myself at least that you will be able to do so lady catherines great attentions to mrs collins you have been a daily witness of and altogether i trust it does not appear that your friend has drawn an unfortunatebut on this point it will be as well to be silent only let me assure you my dear miss elizabeth that i can from my heart most cordially wish you equal felicity in marriage my dear charlotte and i have but one mind and one way of thinking there is in everything a most remarkable resemblance of character and ideas between us we seem to have been designed for each other ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth could safely say that it was a great happiness where that was the case and with equal sincerity could add that she firmly believed and rejoiced in his domestic comforts she was not sorry however to have the recital of them interrupted by the lady from whom they sprang poor charlotte it was melancholy to leave her to such society but she had chosen it with her eyes open and though evidently regretting that her visitors were to go she did not seem to ask for compassion her home and her housekeeping her parish and her poultry and all their dependent concerns had not yet lost their charms ,Pride and Prejudice
at length the chaise arrived the trunks were fastened on the parcels placed within and it was pronounced to be ready after an affectionate parting between the friends elizabeth was attended to the carriage by mr collins and as they walked down the garden he was commissioning her with his best respects to all her family not forgetting his thanks for the kindness he had received at longbourn in the winter and his compliments to mr and mrs gardiner though unknown he then handed her in maria followed and the door was on the point of being closed when he suddenly reminded them with some consternation that they had hitherto forgotten to leave any message for the ladies at rosings ,Pride and Prejudice
their journey was performed without much conversation or any alarm and within four hours of their leaving hunsford they reached mr gardiners house where they were to remain a few days ,Pride and Prejudice
jane looked well and elizabeth had little opportunity of studying her spirits amidst the various engagements which the kindness of her aunt had reserved for them but jane was to go home with her and at longbourn there would be leisure enough for observation ,Pride and Prejudice
it was not without an effort meanwhile that she could wait even for longbourn before she told her sister of mr darcys proposals to know that she had the power of revealing what would so exceedingly astonish jane and must at the same time so highly gratify whatever of her own vanity she had not yet been able to reason away was such a temptation to openness as nothing could have conquered but the state of indecision in which she remained as to the extent of what she should communicate and her fear if she once entered on the subject of being hurried into repeating something of bingley which might only grieve her sister further ,Pride and Prejudice
it was the second week in may in which the three young ladies set out together from gracechurch street for the town of  in hertfordshire and as they drew near the appointed inn where mr bennets carriage was to meet them they quickly perceived in token of the coachmans punctuality both kitty and lydia looking out of a diningroom up stairs these two girls had been above an hour in the place happily employed in visiting an opposite milliner watching the sentinel on guard and dressing a salad and cucumber ,Pride and Prejudice
after welcoming their sisters they triumphantly displayed a table set out with such cold meat as an inn larder usually affords exclaiming is not this nice is not this an agreeable surprise ,Pride and Prejudice
and we mean to treat you all added lydia but you must lend us the money for we have just spent ours at the shop out there then showing her purchaseslook here i have bought this bonnet i do not think it is very pretty but i thought i might as well buy it as not i shall pull it to pieces as soon as i get home and see if i can make it up any better ,Pride and Prejudice
and when her sisters abused it as ugly she added with perfect unconcern oh but there were two or three much uglier in the shop and when i have bought some prettiercoloured satin to trim it with fresh i think it will be very tolerable besides it will not much signify what one wears this summer after the shire have left meryton and they are going in a fortnight ,Pride and Prejudice
they are going to be encamped near brighton and i do so want papa to take us all there for the summer it would be such a delicious scheme and i dare say would hardly cost anything at all mamma would like to go too of all things only think what a miserable summer else we shall have ,Pride and Prejudice
yes thought elizabeth that would be a delightful scheme indeed and completely do for us at once good heaven brighton and a whole campful of soldiers to us who have been overset already by one poor regiment of militia and the monthly balls of meryton ,Pride and Prejudice
aye that is just like your formality and discretion you thought the waiter must not hear as if he cared i dare say he often hears worse things said than i am going to say but he is an ugly fellow i am glad he is gone i never saw such a long chin in my life well but now for my news it is about dear wickham too good for the waiter is it not there is no danger of wickhams marrying mary king theres for you she is gone down to her uncle at liverpool gone to stay wickham is safe ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was shocked to think that however incapable of such coarseness of expression herself the coarseness of the sentiment was little other than her own breast had harboured and fancied liberal ,Pride and Prejudice
as soon as all had ate and the elder ones paid the carriage was ordered and after some contrivance the whole party with all their boxes workbags and parcels and the unwelcome addition of kittys and lydias purchases were seated in it ,Pride and Prejudice
how nicely we are all crammed in cried lydia i am glad i bought my bonnet if it is only for the fun of having another bandbox well now let us be quite comfortable and snug and talk and laugh all the way home and in the first place let us hear what has happened to you all since you went away have you seen any pleasant men have you had any flirting i was in great hopes that one of you would have got a husband before you came back jane will be quite an old maid soon i declare she is almost threeandtwenty lord how ashamed i should be of not being married before threeandtwenty my aunt phillips wants you so to get husbands you cant think she says lizzy had better have taken mr collins but i do not think there would have been any fun in it lord how i should like to be married before any of you and then i would chaperon you about to all the balls dear me we had such a good piece of fun the other day at colonel forsters kitty and me were to spend the day there and mrs forster promised to have a little dance in the evening by the bye mrs forster and me are such friends and so she asked the two harringtons to come but harriet was ill and so pen was forced to come by herself and then what do you think we did we dressed up chamberlayne in womans clothes on purpose to pass for a lady only think what fun not a soul knew of it but colonel and mrs forster and kitty and me except my aunt for we were forced to borrow one of her gowns and you cannot imagine how well he looked when denny and wickham and pratt and two or three more of the men came in they did not know him in the least lord how i laughed and so did mrs forster i thought i should have died and that made the men suspect something and then they soon found out what was the matter ,Pride and Prejudice
with such kinds of histories of their parties and good jokes did lydia assisted by kittys hints and additions endeavour to amuse her companions all the way to longbourn elizabeth listened as little as she could but there was no escaping the frequent mention of wickhams name ,Pride and Prejudice
their party in the diningroom was large for almost all the lucases came to meet maria and hear the news and various were the subjects that occupied them lady lucas was enquiring of maria after the welfare and poultry of her eldest daughter mrs bennet was doubly engaged on one hand collecting an account of the present fashions from jane who sat some way below her and on the other retailing them all to the younger lucases and lydia in a voice rather louder than any other persons was enumerating the various pleasures of the morning to anybody who would hear her ,Pride and Prejudice
oh mary said she i wish you had gone with us for we had such fun as we went along kitty and i drew up the blinds and pretended there was nobody in the coach and i should have gone so all the way if kitty had not been sick and when we got to the george i do think we behaved very handsomely for we treated the other three with the nicest cold luncheon in the world and if you would have gone we would have treated you too and then when we came away it was such fun i thought we never should have got into the coach i was ready to die of laughter and then we were so merry all the way home we talked and laughed so loud that anybody might have heard us ten miles off ,Pride and Prejudice
to this mary very gravely replied far be it from me my dear sister to depreciate such pleasures they would doubtless be congenial with the generality of female minds but i confess they would have no charms for mei should infinitely prefer a book ,Pride and Prejudice
in the afternoon lydia was urgent with the rest of the girls to walk to meryton and to see how everybody went on but elizabeth steadily opposed the scheme it should not be said that the miss bennets could not be at home half a day before they were in pursuit of the officers there was another reason too for her opposition she dreaded seeing mr wickham again and was resolved to avoid it as long as possible the comfort to her of the regiments approaching removal was indeed beyond expression in a fortnight they were to goand once gone she hoped there could be nothing more to plague her on his account ,Pride and Prejudice
she had not been many hours at home before she found that the brighton scheme of which lydia had given them a hint at the inn was under frequent discussion between her parents elizabeth saw directly that her father had not the smallest intention of yielding but his answers were at the same time so vague and equivocal that her mother though often disheartened had never yet despaired of succeeding at last ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths impatience to acquaint jane with what had happened could no longer be overcome and at length resolving to suppress every particular in which her sister was concerned and preparing her to be surprised she related to her the next morning the chief of the scene between mr darcy and herself ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bennets astonishment was soon lessened by the strong sisterly partiality which made any admiration of elizabeth appear perfectly natural and all surprise was shortly lost in other feelings she was sorry that mr darcy should have delivered his sentiments in a manner so little suited to recommend them but still more was she grieved for the unhappiness which her sisters refusal must have given him ,Pride and Prejudice
she then spoke of the letter repeating the whole of its contents as far as they concerned george wickham what a stroke was this for poor jane who would willingly have gone through the world without believing that so much wickedness existed in the whole race of mankind as was here collected in one individual nor was darcys vindication though grateful to her feelings capable of consoling her for such discovery most earnestly did she labour to prove the probability of error and seek to clear the one without involving the other ,Pride and Prejudice
this will not do said elizabeth you never will be able to make both of them good for anything take your choice but you must be satisfied with only one there is but such a quantity of merit between them just enough to make one good sort of man and of late it has been shifting about pretty much for my part i am inclined to believe it all darcys but you shall do as you choose ,Pride and Prejudice
i do not know when i have been more shocked said she wickham so very bad it is almost past belief and poor mr darcy dear lizzy only consider what he must have suffered such a disappointment and with the knowledge of your ill opinion too and having to relate such a thing of his sister it is really too distressing i am sure you must feel it so ,Pride and Prejudice
oh no my regret and compassion are all done away by seeing you so full of both i know you will do him such ample justice that i am growing every moment more unconcerned and indifferent your profusion makes me saving and if you lament over him much longer my heart will be as light as a feather ,Pride and Prejudice
and yet i meant to be uncommonly clever in taking so decided a dislike to him without any reason it is such a spur to ones genius such an opening for wit to have a dislike of that kind one may be continually abusive without saying anything just but one cannot always be laughing at a man without now and then stumbling on something witty ,Pride and Prejudice
indeed i could not i was uncomfortable enough i may say unhappy and with no one to speak to about what i felt no jane to comfort me and say that i had not been so very weak and vain and nonsensical as i knew i had oh how i wanted you ,Pride and Prejudice
certainly but the misfortune of speaking with bitterness is a most natural consequence of the prejudices i had been encouraging there is one point on which i want your advice i want to be told whether i ought or ought not to make our acquaintances in general understand wickhams character ,Pride and Prejudice
that it ought not to be attempted mr darcy has not authorised me to make his communication public on the contrary every particular relative to his sister was meant to be kept as much as possible to myself and if i endeavour to undeceive people as to the rest of his conduct who will believe me the general prejudice against mr darcy is so violent that it would be the death of half the good people in meryton to attempt to place him in an amiable light i am not equal to it wickham will soon be gone and therefore it will not signify to anyone here what he really is some time hence it will be all found out and then we may laugh at their stupidity in not knowing it before at present i will say nothing about it ,Pride and Prejudice
you are quite right to have his errors made public might ruin him for ever he is now perhaps sorry for what he has done and anxious to reestablish a character we must not make him desperate ,Pride and Prejudice
the tumult of elizabeths mind was allayed by this conversation she had got rid of two of the secrets which had weighed on her for a fortnight and was certain of a willing listener in jane whenever she might wish to talk again of either but there was still something lurking behind of which prudence forbade the disclosure she dared not relate the other half of mr darcys letter nor explain to her sister how sincerely she had been valued by her friend here was knowledge in which no one could partake and she was sensible that nothing less than a perfect understanding between the parties could justify her in throwing off this last encumbrance of mystery and then said she if that very improbable event should ever take place i shall merely be able to tell what bingley may tell in a much more agreeable manner himself the liberty of communication cannot be mine till it has lost all its value ,Pride and Prejudice
she was now on being settled at home at leisure to observe the real state of her sisters spirits jane was not happy she still cherished a very tender affection for bingley having never even fancied herself in love before her regard had all the warmth of first attachment and from her age and disposition greater steadiness than most first attachments often boast and so fervently did she value his remembrance and prefer him to every other man that all her good sense and all her attention to the feelings of her friends were requisite to check the indulgence of those regrets which must have been injurious to her own health and their tranquillity ,Pride and Prejudice
well lizzy said mrs bennet one day what is your opinion now of this sad business of janes for my part i am determined never to speak of it again to anybody i told my sister phillips so the other day but i cannot find out that jane saw anything of him in london well he is a very undeserving young manand i do not suppose theres the least chance in the world of her ever getting him now there is no talk of his coming to netherfield again in the summer and i have enquired of everybody too who is likely to know ,Pride and Prejudice
oh well it is just as he chooses nobody wants him to come though i shall always say he used my daughter extremely ill and if i was her i would not have put up with it well my comfort is i am sure jane will die of a broken heart and then he will be sorry for what he has done ,Pride and Prejudice
well lizzy continued her mother soon afterwards and so the collinses live very comfortable do they well well i only hope it will last and what sort of table do they keep charlotte is an excellent manager i dare say if she is half as sharp as her mother she is saving enough there is nothing extravagant in their housekeeping i dare say ,Pride and Prejudice
a great deal of good management depend upon it yes yes they will take care not to outrun their income they will never be distressed for money well much good may it do them and so i suppose they often talk of having longbourn when your father is dead they look upon it as quite their own i dare say whenever that happens ,Pride and Prejudice
no it would have been strange if they had but i make no doubt they often talk of it between themselves well if they can be easy with an estate that is not lawfully their own so much the better i should be ashamed of having one that was only entailed on me ,Pride and Prejudice
the first week of their return was soon gone the second began it was the last of the regiments stay in meryton and all the young ladies in the neighbourhood were drooping apace the dejection was almost universal the elder miss bennets alone were still able to eat drink and sleep and pursue the usual course of their employments very frequently were they reproached for this insensibility by kitty and lydia whose own misery was extreme and who could not comprehend such hardheartedness in any of the family ,Pride and Prejudice
such were the kind of lamentations resounding perpetually through longbourn house elizabeth tried to be diverted by them but all sense of pleasure was lost in shame she felt anew the justice of mr darcys objections and never had she been so much disposed to pardon his interference in the views of his friend ,Pride and Prejudice
but the gloom of lydias prospect was shortly cleared away for she received an invitation from mrs forster the wife of the colonel of the regiment to accompany her to brighton this invaluable friend was a very young woman and very lately married a resemblance in good humour and good spirits had recommended her and lydia to each other and out of their three months acquaintance they had been intimate two ,Pride and Prejudice
the rapture of lydia on this occasion her adoration of mrs forster the delight of mrs bennet and the mortification of kitty are scarcely to be described wholly inattentive to her sisters feelings lydia flew about the house in restless ecstasy calling for everyones congratulations and laughing and talking with more violence than ever whilst the luckless kitty continued in the parlour repining at her fate in terms as unreasonable as her accent was peevish ,Pride and Prejudice
i cannot see why mrs forster should not ask me as well as lydia said she though i am not her particular friend i have just as much right to be asked as she has and more too for i am two years older ,Pride and Prejudice
in vain did elizabeth attempt to make her reasonable and jane to make her resigned as for elizabeth herself this invitation was so far from exciting in her the same feelings as in her mother and lydia that she considered it as the death warrant of all possibility of common sense for the latter and detestable as such a step must make her were it known she could not help secretly advising her father not to let her go she represented to him all the improprieties of lydias general behaviour the little advantage she could derive from the friendship of such a woman as mrs forster and the probability of her being yet more imprudent with such a companion at brighton where the temptations must be greater than at home he heard her attentively and then said ,Pride and Prejudice
lydia will never be easy until she has exposed herself in some public place or other and we can never expect her to do it with so little expense or inconvenience to her family as under the present circumstances ,Pride and Prejudice
if you were aware said elizabeth of the very great disadvantage to us all which must arise from the public notice of lydias unguarded and imprudent mannernay which has already arisen from it i am sure you would judge differently in the affair ,Pride and Prejudice
already arisen repeated mr bennet what has she frightened away some of your lovers poor little lizzy but do not be cast down such squeamish youths as cannot bear to be connected with a little absurdity are not worth a regret come let me see the list of pitiful fellows who have been kept aloof by lydias folly ,Pride and Prejudice
indeed you are mistaken i have no such injuries to resent it is not of particular but of general evils which i am now complaining our importance our respectability in the world must be affected by the wild volatility the assurance and disdain of all restraint which mark lydias character excuse me for i must speak plainly if you my dear father will not take the trouble of checking her exuberant spirits and of teaching her that her present pursuits are not to be the business of her life she will soon be beyond the reach of amendment her character will be fixed and she will at sixteen be the most determined flirt that ever made herself or her family ridiculous a flirt too in the worst and meanest degree of flirtation without any attraction beyond youth and a tolerable person and from the ignorance and emptiness of her mind wholly unable to ward off any portion of that universal contempt which her rage for admiration will excite in this danger kitty also is comprehended she will follow wherever lydia leads vain ignorant idle and absolutely uncontrolled oh my dear father can you suppose it possible that they will not be censured and despised wherever they are known and that their sisters will not be often involved in the disgrace ,Pride and Prejudice
do not make yourself uneasy my love wherever you and jane are known you must be respected and valued and you will not appear to less advantage for having a couple ofor i may say threevery silly sisters we shall have no peace at longbourn if lydia does not go to brighton let her go then colonel forster is a sensible man and will keep her out of any real mischief and she is luckily too poor to be an object of prey to anybody at brighton she will be of less importance even as a common flirt than she has been here the officers will find women better worth their notice let us hope therefore that her being there may teach her her own insignificance at any rate she cannot grow many degrees worse without authorising us to lock her up for the rest of her life ,Pride and Prejudice
with this answer elizabeth was forced to be content but her own opinion continued the same and she left him disappointed and sorry it was not in her nature however to increase her vexations by dwelling on them she was confident of having performed her duty and to fret over unavoidable evils or augment them by anxiety was no part of her disposition ,Pride and Prejudice
had lydia and her mother known the substance of her conference with her father their indignation would hardly have found expression in their united volubility in lydias imagination a visit to brighton comprised every possibility of earthly happiness she saw with the creative eye of fancy the streets of that gay bathingplace covered with officers she saw herself the object of attention to tens and to scores of them at present unknown she saw all the glories of the campits tents stretched forth in beauteous uniformity of lines crowded with the young and the gay and dazzling with scarlet and to complete the view she saw herself seated beneath a tent tenderly flirting with at least six officers at once ,Pride and Prejudice
had she known her sister sought to tear her from such prospects and such realities as these what would have been her sensations they could have been understood only by her mother who might have felt nearly the same lydias going to brighton was all that consoled her for her melancholy conviction of her husbands never intending to go there himself ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was now to see mr wickham for the last time having been frequently in company with him since her return agitation was pretty well over the agitations of former partiality entirely so she had even learnt to detect in the very gentleness which had first delighted her an affectation and a sameness to disgust and weary in his present behaviour to herself moreover she had a fresh source of displeasure for the inclination he soon testified of renewing those intentions which had marked the early part of their acquaintance could only serve after what had since passed to provoke her she lost all concern for him in finding herself thus selected as the object of such idle and frivolous gallantry and while she steadily repressed it could not but feel the reproof contained in his believing that however long and for whatever cause his attentions had been withdrawn her vanity would be gratified and her preference secured at any time by their renewal ,Pride and Prejudice
on the very last day of the regiments remaining at meryton he dined with others of the officers at longbourn and so little was elizabeth disposed to part from him in good humour that on his making some enquiry as to the manner in which her time had passed at hunsford she mentioned colonel fitzwilliams and mr darcys having both spent three weeks at rosings and asked him if he was acquainted with the former ,Pride and Prejudice
he looked surprised displeased alarmed but with a moments recollection and a returning smile replied that he had formerly seen him often and after observing that he was a very gentlemanlike man asked her how she had liked him her answer was warmly in his favour with an air of indifference he soon afterwards added ,Pride and Prejudice
indeed cried mr wickham with a look which did not escape her and pray may i ask but checking himself he added in a gayer tone is it in address that he improves has he deigned to add aught of civility to his ordinary stylefor i dare not hope he continued in a lower and more serious tone that he is improved in essentials ,Pride and Prejudice
while she spoke wickham looked as if scarcely knowing whether to rejoice over her words or to distrust their meaning there was a something in her countenance which made him listen with an apprehensive and anxious attention while she added ,Pride and Prejudice
when i said that he improved on acquaintance i did not mean that his mind or his manners were in a state of improvement but that from knowing him better his disposition was better understood ,Pride and Prejudice
wickhams alarm now appeared in a heightened complexion and agitated look for a few minutes he was silent till shaking off his embarrassment he turned to her again and said in the gentlest of accents ,Pride and Prejudice
you who so well know my feeling towards mr darcy will readily comprehend how sincerely i must rejoice that he is wise enough to assume even the appearance of what is right his pride in that direction may be of service if not to himself to many others for it must only deter him from such foul misconduct as i have suffered by i only fear that the sort of cautiousness to which you i imagine have been alluding is merely adopted on his visits to his aunt of whose good opinion and judgement he stands much in awe his fear of her has always operated i know when they were together and a good deal is to be imputed to his wish of forwarding the match with miss de bourgh which i am certain he has very much at heart ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth could not repress a smile at this but she answered only by a slight inclination of the head she saw that he wanted to engage her on the old subject of his grievances and she was in no humour to indulge him the rest of the evening passed with the appearance on his side of usual cheerfulness but with no further attempt to distinguish elizabeth and they parted at last with mutual civility and possibly a mutual desire of never meeting again ,Pride and Prejudice
when the party broke up lydia returned with mrs forster to meryton from whence they were to set out early the next morning the separation between her and her family was rather noisy than pathetic kitty was the only one who shed tears but she did weep from vexation and envy mrs bennet was diffuse in her good wishes for the felicity of her daughter and impressive in her injunctions that she should not miss the opportunity of enjoying herself as much as possibleadvice which there was every reason to believe would be well attended to and in the clamorous happiness of lydia herself in bidding farewell the more gentle adieus of her sisters were uttered without being heard ,Pride and Prejudice
had elizabeths opinion been all drawn from her own family she could not have formed a very pleasing opinion of conjugal felicity or domestic comfort her father captivated by youth and beauty and that appearance of good humour which youth and beauty generally give had married a woman whose weak understanding and illiberal mind had very early in their marriage put an end to all real affection for her respect esteem and confidence had vanished for ever and all his views of domestic happiness were overthrown but mr bennet was not of a disposition to seek comfort for the disappointment which his own imprudence had brought on in any of those pleasures which too often console the unfortunate for their folly or their vice he was fond of the country and of books and from these tastes had arisen his principal enjoyments to his wife he was very little otherwise indebted than as her ignorance and folly had contributed to his amusement this is not the sort of happiness which a man would in general wish to owe to his wife but where other powers of entertainment are wanting the true philosopher will derive benefit from such as are given ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth however had never been blind to the impropriety of her fathers behaviour as a husband she had always seen it with pain but respecting his abilities and grateful for his affectionate treatment of herself she endeavoured to forget what she could not overlook and to banish from her thoughts that continual breach of conjugal obligation and decorum which in exposing his wife to the contempt of her own children was so highly reprehensible but she had never felt so strongly as now the disadvantages which must attend the children of so unsuitable a marriage nor ever been so fully aware of the evils arising from so illjudged a direction of talents talents which rightly used might at least have preserved the respectability of his daughters even if incapable of enlarging the mind of his wife ,Pride and Prejudice
when elizabeth had rejoiced over wickhams departure she found little other cause for satisfaction in the loss of the regiment their parties abroad were less varied than before and at home she had a mother and sister whose constant repinings at the dullness of everything around them threw a real gloom over their domestic circle and though kitty might in time regain her natural degree of sense since the disturbers of her brain were removed her other sister from whose disposition greater evil might be apprehended was likely to be hardened in all her folly and assurance by a situation of such double danger as a wateringplace and a camp upon the whole therefore she found what has been sometimes found before that an event to which she had looked forward with impatient desire did not in taking place bring all the satisfaction she had promised herself it was consequently necessary to name some other period for the commencement of actual felicityto have some other point on which her wishes and hopes might be fixed and by again enjoying the pleasure of anticipation console herself for the present and prepare for another disappointment her tour to the lakes was now the object of her happiest thoughts it was her best consolation for all the uncomfortable hours which the discontentedness of her mother and kitty made inevitable and could she have included jane in the scheme every part of it would have been perfect ,Pride and Prejudice
but it is fortunate thought she that i have something to wish for were the whole arrangement complete my disappointment would be certain but here by carrying with me one ceaseless source of regret in my sisters absence i may reasonably hope to have all my expectations of pleasure realised a scheme of which every part promises delight can never be successful and general disappointment is only warded off by the defence of some little peculiar vexation ,Pride and Prejudice
when lydia went away she promised to write very often and very minutely to her mother and kitty but her letters were always long expected and always very short those to her mother contained little else than that they were just returned from the library where such and such officers had attended them and where she had seen such beautiful ornaments as made her quite wild that she had a new gown or a new parasol which she would have described more fully but was obliged to leave off in a violent hurry as mrs forster called her and they were going off to the camp and from her correspondence with her sister there was still less to be learntfor her letters to kitty though rather longer were much too full of lines under the words to be made public ,Pride and Prejudice
after the first fortnight or three weeks of her absence health good humour and cheerfulness began to reappear at longbourn everything wore a happier aspect the families who had been in town for the winter came back again and summer finery and summer engagements arose mrs bennet was restored to her usual querulous serenity and by the middle of june kitty was so much recovered as to be able to enter meryton without tears an event of such happy promise as to make elizabeth hope that by the following christmas she might be so tolerably reasonable as not to mention an officer above once a day unless by some cruel and malicious arrangement at the war office another regiment should be quartered in meryton ,Pride and Prejudice
the time fixed for the beginning of their northern tour was now fast approaching and a fortnight only was wanting of it when a letter arrived from mrs gardiner which at once delayed its commencement and curtailed its extent mr gardiner would be prevented by business from setting out till a fortnight later in july and must be in london again within a month and as that left too short a period for them to go so far and see so much as they had proposed or at least to see it with the leisure and comfort they had built on they were obliged to give up the lakes and substitute a more contracted tour and according to the present plan were to go no farther northwards than derbyshire in that county there was enough to be seen to occupy the chief of their three weeks and to mrs gardiner it had a peculiarly strong attraction the town where she had formerly passed some years of her life and where they were now to spend a few days was probably as great an object of her curiosity as all the celebrated beauties of matlock chatsworth dovedale or the peak ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was excessively disappointed she had set her heart on seeing the lakes and still thought there might have been time enough but it was her business to be satisfiedand certainly her temper to be happy and all was soon right again ,Pride and Prejudice
with the mention of derbyshire there were many ideas connected it was impossible for her to see the word without thinking of pemberley and its owner but surely said she i may enter his county with impunity and rob it of a few petrified spars without his perceiving me ,Pride and Prejudice
the period of expectation was now doubled four weeks were to pass away before her uncle and aunts arrival but they did pass away and mr and mrs gardiner with their four children did at length appear at longbourn the children two girls of six and eight years old and two younger boys were to be left under the particular care of their cousin jane who was the general favourite and whose steady sense and sweetness of temper exactly adapted her for attending to them in every wayteaching them playing with them and loving them ,Pride and Prejudice
the gardiners stayed only one night at longbourn and set off the next morning with elizabeth in pursuit of novelty and amusement one enjoyment was certainthat of suitableness of companions a suitableness which comprehended health and temper to bear inconveniencescheerfulness to enhance every pleasureand affection and intelligence which might supply it among themselves if there were disappointments abroad ,Pride and Prejudice
it is not the object of this work to give a description of derbyshire nor of any of the remarkable places through which their route thither lay oxford blenheim warwick kenilworth birmingham etc are sufficiently known a small part of derbyshire is all the present concern to the little town of lambton the scene of mrs gardiners former residence and where she had lately learned some acquaintance still remained they bent their steps after having seen all the principal wonders of the country and within five miles of lambton elizabeth found from her aunt that pemberley was situated it was not in their direct road nor more than a mile or two out of it in talking over their route the evening before mrs gardiner expressed an inclination to see the place again mr gardiner declared his willingness and elizabeth was applied to for her approbation ,Pride and Prejudice
my love should not you like to see a place of which you have heard so much said her aunt a place too with which so many of your acquaintances are connected wickham passed all his youth there you know ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was distressed she felt that she had no business at pemberley and was obliged to assume a disinclination for seeing it she must own that she was tired of seeing great houses after going over so many she really had no pleasure in fine carpets or satin curtains ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner abused her stupidity if it were merely a fine house richly furnished said she i should not care about it myself but the grounds are delightful they have some of the finest woods in the country ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth said no morebut her mind could not acquiesce the possibility of meeting mr darcy while viewing the place instantly occurred it would be dreadful she blushed at the very idea and thought it would be better to speak openly to her aunt than to run such a risk but against this there were objections and she finally resolved that it could be the last resource if her private enquiries to the absence of the family were unfavourably answered ,Pride and Prejudice
accordingly when she retired at night she asked the chambermaid whether pemberley were not a very fine place what was the name of its proprietor and with no little alarm whether the family were down for the summer a most welcome negative followed the last questionand her alarms now being removed she was at leisure to feel a great deal of curiosity to see the house herself and when the subject was revived the next morning and she was again applied to could readily answer and with a proper air of indifference that she had not really any dislike to the scheme to pemberley therefore they were to go ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths mind was too full for conversation but she saw and admired every remarkable spot and point of view they gradually ascended for halfamile and then found themselves at the top of a considerable eminence where the wood ceased and the eye was instantly caught by pemberley house situated on the opposite side of a valley into which the road with some abruptness wound it was a large handsome stone building standing well on rising ground and backed by a ridge of high woody hills and in front a stream of some natural importance was swelled into greater but without any artificial appearance its banks were neither formal nor falsely adorned elizabeth was delighted she had never seen a place for which nature had done more or where natural beauty had been so little counteracted by an awkward taste they were all of them warm in their admiration and at that moment she felt that to be mistress of pemberley might be something ,Pride and Prejudice
they descended the hill crossed the bridge and drove to the door and while examining the nearer aspect of the house all her apprehension of meeting its owner returned she dreaded lest the chambermaid had been mistaken on applying to see the place they were admitted into the hall and elizabeth as they waited for the housekeeper had leisure to wonder at her being where she was ,Pride and Prejudice
the housekeeper came a respectablelooking elderly woman much less fine and more civil than she had any notion of finding her they followed her into the diningparlour it was a large well proportioned room handsomely fitted up elizabeth after slightly surveying it went to a window to enjoy its prospect the hill crowned with wood which they had descended receiving increased abruptness from the distance was a beautiful object every disposition of the ground was good and she looked on the whole scene the river the trees scattered on its banks and the winding of the valley as far as she could trace it with delight as they passed into other rooms these objects were taking different positions but from every window there were beauties to be seen the rooms were lofty and handsome and their furniture suitable to the fortune of its proprietor but elizabeth saw with admiration of his taste that it was neither gaudy nor uselessly fine with less of splendour and more real elegance than the furniture of rosings ,Pride and Prejudice
and of this place thought she i might have been mistress with these rooms i might now have been familiarly acquainted instead of viewing them as a stranger i might have rejoiced in them as my own and welcomed to them as visitors my uncle and aunt but norecollecting herselfthat could never be my uncle and aunt would have been lost to me i should not have been allowed to invite them ,Pride and Prejudice
she longed to enquire of the housekeeper whether her master was really absent but had not the courage for it at length however the question was asked by her uncle and she turned away with alarm while mrs reynolds replied that he was adding but we expect him tomorrow with a large party of friends how rejoiced was elizabeth that their own journey had not by any circumstance been delayed a day ,Pride and Prejudice
her aunt now called her to look at a picture she approached and saw the likeness of mr wickham suspended amongst several other miniatures over the mantelpiece her aunt asked her smilingly how she liked it the housekeeper came forward and told them it was a picture of a young gentleman the son of her late masters steward who had been brought up by him at his own expense he is now gone into the army she added but i am afraid he has turned out very wild ,Pride and Prejudice
i am sure i know none so handsome but in the gallery up stairs you will see a finer larger picture of him than this this room was my late masters favourite room and these miniatures are just as they used to be then he was very fond of them ,Pride and Prejudice
oh yesthe handsomest young lady that ever was seen and so accomplishedshe plays and sings all day long in the next room is a new instrument just come down for hera present from my master she comes here tomorrow with him ,Pride and Prejudice
mr gardiner whose manners were very easy and pleasant encouraged her communicativeness by his questions and remarks mrs reynolds either by pride or attachment had evidently great pleasure in talking of her master and his sister ,Pride and Prejudice
i say no more than the truth and everybody will say that knows him replied the other elizabeth thought this was going pretty far and she listened with increasing astonishment as the housekeeper added i have never known a cross word from him in my life and i have known him ever since he was four years old ,Pride and Prejudice
this was praise of all others most extraordinary most opposite to her ideas that he was not a goodtempered man had been her firmest opinion her keenest attention was awakened she longed to hear more and was grateful to her uncle for saying ,Pride and Prejudice
yes sir i know i am if i were to go through the world i could not meet with a better but i have always observed that they who are goodnatured when children are goodnatured when they grow up and he was always the sweetesttempered most generoushearted boy in the world ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth listened wondered doubted and was impatient for more mrs reynolds could interest her on no other point she related the subjects of the pictures the dimensions of the rooms and the price of the furniture in vain mr gardiner highly amused by the kind of family prejudice to which he attributed her excessive commendation of her master soon led again to the subject and she dwelt with energy on his many merits as they proceeded together up the great staircase ,Pride and Prejudice
he is the best landlord and the best master said she that ever lived not like the wild young men nowadays who think of nothing but themselves there is not one of his tenants or servants but will give him a good name some people call him proud but i am sure i never saw anything of it to my fancy it is only because he does not rattle away like other young men ,Pride and Prejudice
on reaching the spacious lobby above they were shown into a very pretty sittingroom lately fitted up with greater elegance and lightness than the apartments below and were informed that it was but just done to give pleasure to miss darcy who had taken a liking to the room when last at pemberley ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs reynolds anticipated miss darcys delight when she should enter the room and this is always the way with him she added whatever can give his sister any pleasure is sure to be done in a moment there is nothing he would not do for her ,Pride and Prejudice
the picturegallery and two or three of the principal bedrooms were all that remained to be shown in the former were many good paintings but elizabeth knew nothing of the art and from such as had been already visible below she had willingly turned to look at some drawings of miss darcys in crayons whose subjects were usually more interesting and also more intelligible ,Pride and Prejudice
in the gallery there were many family portraits but they could have little to fix the attention of a stranger elizabeth walked in quest of the only face whose features would be known to her at last it arrested herand she beheld a striking resemblance to mr darcy with such a smile over the face as she remembered to have sometimes seen when he looked at her she stood several minutes before the picture in earnest contemplation and returned to it again before they quitted the gallery mrs reynolds informed them that it had been taken in his fathers lifetime ,Pride and Prejudice
there was certainly at this moment in elizabeths mind a more gentle sensation towards the original than she had ever felt at the height of their acquaintance the commendation bestowed on him by mrs reynolds was of no trifling nature what praise is more valuable than the praise of an intelligent servant as a brother a landlord a master she considered how many peoples happiness were in his guardianshiphow much of pleasure or pain was it in his power to bestowhow much of good or evil must be done by him every idea that had been brought forward by the housekeeper was favourable to his character and as she stood before the canvas on which he was represented and fixed his eyes upon herself she thought of his regard with a deeper sentiment of gratitude than it had ever raised before she remembered its warmth and softened its impropriety of expression ,Pride and Prejudice
when all of the house that was open to general inspection had been seen they returned downstairs and taking leave of the housekeeper were consigned over to the gardener who met them at the halldoor ,Pride and Prejudice
as they walked across the hall towards the river elizabeth turned back to look again her uncle and aunt stopped also and while the former was conjecturing as to the date of the building the owner of it himself suddenly came forward from the road which led behind it to the stables ,Pride and Prejudice
they were within twenty yards of each other and so abrupt was his appearance that it was impossible to avoid his sight their eyes instantly met and the cheeks of both were overspread with the deepest blush he absolutely started and for a moment seemed immovable from surprise but shortly recovering himself advanced towards the party and spoke to elizabeth if not in terms of perfect composure at least of perfect civility ,Pride and Prejudice
she had instinctively turned away but stopping on his approach received his compliments with an embarrassment impossible to be overcome had his first appearance or his resemblance to the picture they had just been examining been insufficient to assure the other two that they now saw mr darcy the gardeners expression of surprise on beholding his master must immediately have told it they stood a little aloof while he was talking to their niece who astonished and confused scarcely dared lift her eyes to his face and knew not what answer she returned to his civil enquiries after her family amazed at the alteration of his manner since they last parted every sentence that he uttered was increasing her embarrassment and every idea of the impropriety of her being found there recurring to her mind the few minutes in which they continued were some of the most uncomfortable in her life nor did he seem much more at ease when he spoke his accent had none of its usual sedateness and he repeated his enquiries as to the time of her having left longbourn and of her stay in derbyshire so often and in so hurried a way as plainly spoke the distraction of his thoughts ,Pride and Prejudice
the others then joined her and expressed admiration of his figure but elizabeth heard not a word and wholly engrossed by her own feelings followed them in silence she was overpowered by shame and vexation her coming there was the most unfortunate the most illjudged thing in the world how strange it must appear to him in what a disgraceful light might it not strike so vain a man it might seem as if she had purposely thrown herself in his way again oh why did she come or why did he thus come a day before he was expected had they been only ten minutes sooner they should have been beyond the reach of his discrimination for it was plain that he was that moment arrivedthat moment alighted from his horse or his carriage she blushed again and again over the perverseness of the meeting and his behaviour so strikingly alteredwhat could it mean that he should even speak to her was amazingbut to speak with such civility to enquire after her family never in her life had she seen his manners so little dignified never had he spoken with such gentleness as on this unexpected meeting what a contrast did it offer to his last address in rosings park when he put his letter into her hand she knew not what to think or how to account for it ,Pride and Prejudice
they had now entered a beautiful walk by the side of the water and every step was bringing forward a nobler fall of ground or a finer reach of the woods to which they were approaching but it was some time before elizabeth was sensible of any of it and though she answered mechanically to the repeated appeals of her uncle and aunt and seemed to direct her eyes to such objects as they pointed out she distinguished no part of the scene her thoughts were all fixed on that one spot of pemberley house whichever it might be where mr darcy then was she longed to know what at the moment was passing in his mindin what manner he thought of her and whether in defiance of everything she was still dear to him perhaps he had been civil only because he felt himself at ease yet there had been that in his voice which was not like ease whether he had felt more of pain or of pleasure in seeing her she could not tell but he certainly had not seen her with composure ,Pride and Prejudice
they entered the woods and bidding adieu to the river for a while ascended some of the higher grounds when in spots where the opening of the trees gave the eye power to wander were many charming views of the valley the opposite hills with the long range of woods overspreading many and occasionally part of the stream mr gardiner expressed a wish of going round the whole park but feared it might be beyond a walk with a triumphant smile they were told that it was ten miles round it settled the matter and they pursued the accustomed circuit which brought them again after some time in a descent among hanging woods to the edge of the water and one of its narrowest parts they crossed it by a simple bridge in character with the general air of the scene it was a spot less adorned than any they had yet visited and the valley here contracted into a glen allowed room only for the stream and a narrow walk amidst the rough coppicewood which bordered it elizabeth longed to explore its windings but when they had crossed the bridge and perceived their distance from the house mrs gardiner who was not a great walker could go no farther and thought only of returning to the carriage as quickly as possible her niece was therefore obliged to submit and they took their way towards the house on the opposite side of the river in the nearest direction but their progress was slow for mr gardiner though seldom able to indulge the taste was very fond of fishing and was so much engaged in watching the occasional appearance of some trout in the water and talking to the man about them that he advanced but little whilst wandering on in this slow manner they were again surprised and elizabeths astonishment was quite equal to what it had been at first by the sight of mr darcy approaching them and at no great distance the walk being here less sheltered than on the other side allowed them to see him before they met elizabeth however astonished was at least more prepared for an interview than before and resolved to appear and to speak with calmness if he really intended to meet them for a few moments indeed she felt that he would probably strike into some other path the idea lasted while a turning in the walk concealed him from their view the turning past he was immediately before them with a glance she saw that he had lost none of his recent civility and to imitate his politeness she began as they met to admire the beauty of the place but she had not got beyond the words delightful and charming when some unlucky recollections obtruded and she fancied that praise of pemberley from her might be mischievously construed her colour changed and she said no more ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner was standing a little behind and on her pausing he asked her if she would do him the honour of introducing him to her friends this was a stroke of civility for which she was quite unprepared and she could hardly suppress a smile at his being now seeking the acquaintance of some of those very people against whom his pride had revolted in his offer to herself what will be his surprise thought she when he knows who they are he takes them now for people of fashion ,Pride and Prejudice
the introduction however was immediately made and as she named their relationship to herself she stole a sly look at him to see how he bore it and was not without the expectation of his decamping as fast as he could from such disgraceful companions that he was surprised by the connection was evident he sustained it however with fortitude and so far from going away turned back with them and entered into conversation with mr gardiner elizabeth could not but be pleased could not but triumph it was consoling that he should know she had some relations for whom there was no need to blush she listened most attentively to all that passed between them and gloried in every expression every sentence of her uncle which marked his intelligence his taste or his good manners ,Pride and Prejudice
the conversation soon turned upon fishing and she heard mr darcy invite him with the greatest civility to fish there as often as he chose while he continued in the neighbourhood offering at the same time to supply him with fishing tackle and pointing out those parts of the stream where there was usually most sport mrs gardiner who was walking arminarm with elizabeth gave her a look expressive of wonder elizabeth said nothing but it gratified her exceedingly the compliment must be all for herself her astonishment however was extreme and continually was she repeating why is he so altered from what can it proceed it cannot be for meit cannot be for my sake that his manners are thus softened my reproofs at hunsford could not work such a change as this it is impossible that he should still love me ,Pride and Prejudice
after walking some time in this way the two ladies in front the two gentlemen behind on resuming their places after descending to the brink of the river for the better inspection of some curious waterplant there chanced to be a little alteration it originated in mrs gardiner who fatigued by the exercise of the morning found elizabeths arm inadequate to her support and consequently preferred her husbands mr darcy took her place by her niece and they walked on together after a short silence the lady first spoke she wished him to know that she had been assured of his absence before she came to the place and accordingly began by observing that his arrival had been very unexpectedfor your housekeeper she added informed us that you would certainly not be here till tomorrow and indeed before we left bakewell we understood that you were not immediately expected in the country he acknowledged the truth of it all and said that business with his steward had occasioned his coming forward a few hours before the rest of the party with whom he had been travelling they will join me early tomorrow he continued and among them are some who will claim an acquaintance with youmr bingley and his sisters ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth answered only by a slight bow her thoughts were instantly driven back to the time when mr bingleys name had been the last mentioned between them and if she might judge by his complexion his mind was not very differently engaged ,Pride and Prejudice
there is also one other person in the party he continued after a pause who more particularly wishes to be known to you will you allow me or do i ask too much to introduce my sister to your acquaintance during your stay at lambton ,Pride and Prejudice
the surprise of such an application was great indeed it was too great for her to know in what manner she acceded to it she immediately felt that whatever desire miss darcy might have of being acquainted with her must be the work of her brother and without looking farther it was satisfactory it was gratifying to know that his resentment had not made him think really ill of her ,Pride and Prejudice
they now walked on in silence each of them deep in thought elizabeth was not comfortable that was impossible but she was flattered and pleased his wish of introducing his sister to her was a compliment of the highest kind they soon outstripped the others and when they had reached the carriage mr and mrs gardiner were half a quarter of a mile behind ,Pride and Prejudice
he then asked her to walk into the housebut she declared herself not tired and they stood together on the lawn at such a time much might have been said and silence was very awkward she wanted to talk but there seemed to be an embargo on every subject at last she recollected that she had been travelling and they talked of matlock and dove dale with great perseverance yet time and her aunt moved slowlyand her patience and her ideas were nearly worn out before the ttette was over ,Pride and Prejudice
on mr and mrs gardiners coming up they were all pressed to go into the house and take some refreshment but this was declined and they parted on each side with utmost politeness mr darcy handed the ladies into the carriage and when it drove off elizabeth saw him walking slowly towards the house ,Pride and Prejudice
the observations of her uncle and aunt now began and each of them pronounced him to be infinitely superior to anything they had expected he is perfectly well behaved polite and unassuming said her uncle ,Pride and Prejudice
there is something a little stately in him to be sure replied her aunt but it is confined to his air and is not unbecoming i can now say with the housekeeper that though some people may call him proud i have seen nothing of it ,Pride and Prejudice
i was never more surprised than by his behaviour to us it was more than civil it was really attentive and there was no necessity for such attention his acquaintance with elizabeth was very trifling ,Pride and Prejudice
to be sure lizzy said her aunt he is not so handsome as wickham or rather he has not wickhams countenance for his features are perfectly good but how came you to tell me that he was so disagreeable ,Pride and Prejudice
but perhaps he may be a little whimsical in his civilities replied her uncle your great men often are and therefore i shall not take him at his word as he might change his mind another day and warn me off his grounds ,Pride and Prejudice
from what we have seen of him continued mrs gardiner i really should not have thought that he could have behaved in so cruel a way by anybody as he has done by poor wickham he has not an illnatured look on the contrary there is something pleasing about his mouth when he speaks and there is something of dignity in his countenance that would not give one an unfavourable idea of his heart but to be sure the good lady who showed us his house did give him a most flaming character i could hardly help laughing aloud sometimes but he is a liberal master i suppose and that in the eye of a servant comprehends every virtue ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth here felt herself called on to say something in vindication of his behaviour to wickham and therefore gave them to understand in as guarded a manner as she could that by what she had heard from his relations in kent his actions were capable of a very different construction and that his character was by no means so faulty nor wickhams so amiable as they had been considered in hertfordshire in confirmation of this she related the particulars of all the pecuniary transactions in which they had been connected without actually naming her authority but stating it to be such as might be relied on ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner was surprised and concerned but as they were now approaching the scene of her former pleasures every idea gave way to the charm of recollection and she was too much engaged in pointing out to her husband all the interesting spots in its environs to think of anything else fatigued as she had been by the mornings walk they had no sooner dined than she set off again in quest of her former acquaintance and the evening was spent in the satisfactions of an intercourse renewed after many years discontinuance ,Pride and Prejudice
the occurrences of the day were too full of interest to leave elizabeth much attention for any of these new friends and she could do nothing but think and think with wonder of mr darcys civility and above all of his wishing her to be acquainted with his sister ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth had settled it that mr darcy would bring his sister to visit her the very day after her reaching pemberley and was consequently resolved not to be out of sight of the inn the whole of that morning but her conclusion was false for on the very morning after their arrival at lambton these visitors came they had been walking about the place with some of their new friends and were just returning to the inn to dress themselves for dining with the same family when the sound of a carriage drew them to a window and they saw a gentleman and a lady in a curricle driving up the street elizabeth immediately recognizing the livery guessed what it meant and imparted no small degree of her surprise to her relations by acquainting them with the honour which she expected her uncle and aunt were all amazement and the embarrassment of her manner as she spoke joined to the circumstance itself and many of the circumstances of the preceding day opened to them a new idea on the business nothing had ever suggested it before but they felt that there was no other way of accounting for such attentions from such a quarter than by supposing a partiality for their niece while these newlyborn notions were passing in their heads the perturbation of elizabeths feelings was at every moment increasing she was quite amazed at her own discomposure but amongst other causes of disquiet she dreaded lest the partiality of the brother should have said too much in her favour and more than commonly anxious to please she naturally suspected that every power of pleasing would fail her ,Pride and Prejudice
she retreated from the window fearful of being seen and as she walked up and down the room endeavouring to compose herself saw such looks of enquiring surprise in her uncle and aunt as made everything worse ,Pride and Prejudice
miss darcy and her brother appeared and this formidable introduction took place with astonishment did elizabeth see that her new acquaintance was at least as much embarrassed as herself since her being at lambton she had heard that miss darcy was exceedingly proud but the observation of a very few minutes convinced her that she was only exceedingly shy she found it difficult to obtain even a word from her beyond a monosyllable ,Pride and Prejudice
miss darcy was tall and on a larger scale than elizabeth and though little more than sixteen her figure was formed and her appearance womanly and graceful she was less handsome than her brother but there was sense and good humour in her face and her manners were perfectly unassuming and gentle elizabeth who had expected to find in her as acute and unembarrassed an observer as ever mr darcy had been was much relieved by discerning such different feelings ,Pride and Prejudice
they had not long been together before mr darcy told her that bingley was also coming to wait on her and she had barely time to express her satisfaction and prepare for such a visitor when bingleys quick step was heard on the stairs and in a moment he entered the room all elizabeths anger against him had been long done away but had she still felt any it could hardly have stood its ground against the unaffected cordiality with which he expressed himself on seeing her again he enquired in a friendly though general way after her family and looked and spoke with the same goodhumoured ease that he had ever done ,Pride and Prejudice
to mr and mrs gardiner he was scarcely a less interesting personage than to herself they had long wished to see him the whole party before them indeed excited a lively attention the suspicions which had just arisen of mr darcy and their niece directed their observation towards each with an earnest though guarded enquiry and they soon drew from those enquiries the full conviction that one of them at least knew what it was to love of the ladys sensations they remained a little in doubt but that the gentleman was overflowing with admiration was evident enough ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth on her side had much to do she wanted to ascertain the feelings of each of her visitors she wanted to compose her own and to make herself agreeable to all and in the latter object where she feared most to fail she was most sure of success for those to whom she endeavoured to give pleasure were prepossessed in her favour bingley was ready georgiana was eager and darcy determined to be pleased ,Pride and Prejudice
in seeing bingley her thoughts naturally flew to her sister and oh how ardently did she long to know whether any of his were directed in a like manner sometimes she could fancy that he talked less than on former occasions and once or twice pleased herself with the notion that as he looked at her he was trying to trace a resemblance but though this might be imaginary she could not be deceived as to his behaviour to miss darcy who had been set up as a rival to jane no look appeared on either side that spoke particular regard nothing occurred between them that could justify the hopes of his sister on this point she was soon satisfied and two or three little circumstances occurred ere they parted which in her anxious interpretation denoted a recollection of jane not untinctured by tenderness and a wish of saying more that might lead to the mention of her had he dared he observed to her at a moment when the others were talking together and in a tone which had something of real regret that it was a very long time since he had had the pleasure of seeing her and before she could reply he added it is above eight months we have not met since the th of november when we were all dancing together at netherfield ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was pleased to find his memory so exact and he afterwards took occasion to ask her when unattended to by any of the rest whether all her sisters were at longbourn there was not much in the question nor in the preceding remark but there was a look and a manner which gave them meaning ,Pride and Prejudice
it was not often that she could turn her eyes on mr darcy himself but whenever she did catch a glimpse she saw an expression of general complaisance and in all that he said she heard an accent so removed from hauteur or disdain of his companions as convinced her that the improvement of manners which she had yesterday witnessed however temporary its existence might prove had at least outlived one day when she saw him thus seeking the acquaintance and courting the good opinion of people with whom any intercourse a few months ago would have been a disgracewhen she saw him thus civil not only to herself but to the very relations whom he had openly disdained and recollected their last lively scene in hunsford parsonagethe difference the change was so great and struck so forcibly on her mind that she could hardly restrain her astonishment from being visible never even in the company of his dear friends at netherfield or his dignified relations at rosings had she seen him so desirous to please so free from selfconsequence or unbending reserve as now when no importance could result from the success of his endeavours and when even the acquaintance of those to whom his attentions were addressed would draw down the ridicule and censure of the ladies both of netherfield and rosings ,Pride and Prejudice
their visitors stayed with them above halfanhour and when they arose to depart mr darcy called on his sister to join him in expressing their wish of seeing mr and mrs gardiner and miss bennet to dinner at pemberley before they left the country miss darcy though with a diffidence which marked her little in the habit of giving invitations readily obeyed mrs gardiner looked at her niece desirous of knowing how she whom the invitation most concerned felt disposed as to its acceptance but elizabeth had turned away her head presuming however that this studied avoidance spoke rather a momentary embarrassment than any dislike of the proposal and seeing in her husband who was fond of society a perfect willingness to accept it she ventured to engage for her attendance and the day after the next was fixed on ,Pride and Prejudice
bingley expressed great pleasure in the certainty of seeing elizabeth again having still a great deal to say to her and many enquiries to make after all their hertfordshire friends elizabeth construing all this into a wish of hearing her speak of her sister was pleased and on this account as well as some others found herself when their visitors left them capable of considering the last halfhour with some satisfaction though while it was passing the enjoyment of it had been little eager to be alone and fearful of enquiries or hints from her uncle and aunt she stayed with them only long enough to hear their favourable opinion of bingley and then hurried away to dress ,Pride and Prejudice
but she had no reason to fear mr and mrs gardiners curiosity it was not their wish to force her communication it was evident that she was much better acquainted with mr darcy than they had before any idea of it was evident that he was very much in love with her they saw much to interest but nothing to justify enquiry ,Pride and Prejudice
of mr darcy it was now a matter of anxiety to think well and as far as their acquaintance reached there was no fault to find they could not be untouched by his politeness and had they drawn his character from their own feelings and his servants report without any reference to any other account the circle in hertfordshire to which he was known would not have recognized it for mr darcy there was now an interest however in believing the housekeeper and they soon became sensible that the authority of a servant who had known him since he was four years old and whose own manners indicated respectability was not to be hastily rejected neither had anything occurred in the intelligence of their lambton friends that could materially lessen its weight they had nothing to accuse him of but pride pride he probably had and if not it would certainly be imputed by the inhabitants of a small markettown where the family did not visit it was acknowledged however that he was a liberal man and did much good among the poor ,Pride and Prejudice
with respect to wickham the travellers soon found that he was not held there in much estimation for though the chief of his concerns with the son of his patron were imperfectly understood it was yet a wellknown fact that on his quitting derbyshire he had left many debts behind him which mr darcy afterwards discharged ,Pride and Prejudice
as for elizabeth her thoughts were at pemberley this evening more than the last and the evening though as it passed it seemed long was not long enough to determine her feelings towards one in that mansion and she lay awake two whole hours endeavouring to make them out she certainly did not hate him no hatred had vanished long ago and she had almost as long been ashamed of ever feeling a dislike against him that could be so called the respect created by the conviction of his valuable qualities though at first unwillingly admitted had for some time ceased to be repugnant to her feeling and it was now heightened into somewhat of a friendlier nature by the testimony so highly in his favour and bringing forward his disposition in so amiable a light which yesterday had produced but above all above respect and esteem there was a motive within her of goodwill which could not be overlooked it was gratitude gratitude not merely for having once loved her but for loving her still well enough to forgive all the petulance and acrimony of her manner in rejecting him and all the unjust accusations accompanying her rejection he who she had been persuaded would avoid her as his greatest enemy seemed on this accidental meeting most eager to preserve the acquaintance and without any indelicate display of regard or any peculiarity of manner where their two selves only were concerned was soliciting the good opinion of her friends and bent on making her known to his sister such a change in a man of so much pride exciting not only astonishment but gratitudefor to love ardent love it must be attributed and as such its impression on her was of a sort to be encouraged as by no means unpleasing though it could not be exactly defined she respected she esteemed she was grateful to him she felt a real interest in his welfare and she only wanted to know how far she wished that welfare to depend upon herself and how far it would be for the happiness of both that she should employ the power which her fancy told her she still possessed of bringing on her the renewal of his addresses ,Pride and Prejudice
it had been settled in the evening between the aunt and the niece that such a striking civility as miss darcys in coming to see them on the very day of her arrival at pemberley for she had reached it only to a late breakfast ought to be imitated though it could not be equalled by some exertion of politeness on their side and consequently that it would be highly expedient to wait on her at pemberley the following morning they were therefore to go elizabeth was pleased though when she asked herself the reason she had very little to say in reply ,Pride and Prejudice
convinced as elizabeth now was that miss bingleys dislike of her had originated in jealousy she could not help feeling how unwelcome her appearance at pemberley must be to her and was curious to know with how much civility on that ladys side the acquaintance would now be renewed ,Pride and Prejudice
on reaching the house they were shown through the hall into the saloon whose northern aspect rendered it delightful for summer its windows opening to the ground admitted a most refreshing view of the high woody hills behind the house and of the beautiful oaks and spanish chestnuts which were scattered over the intermediate lawn ,Pride and Prejudice
in this house they were received by miss darcy who was sitting there with mrs hurst and miss bingley and the lady with whom she lived in london georgianas reception of them was very civil but attended with all the embarrassment which though proceeding from shyness and the fear of doing wrong would easily give to those who felt themselves inferior the belief of her being proud and reserved mrs gardiner and her niece however did her justice and pitied her ,Pride and Prejudice
by mrs hurst and miss bingley they were noticed only by a curtsey and on their being seated a pause awkward as such pauses must always be succeeded for a few moments it was first broken by mrs annesley a genteel agreeablelooking woman whose endeavour to introduce some kind of discourse proved her to be more truly wellbred than either of the others and between her and mrs gardiner with occasional help from elizabeth the conversation was carried on miss darcy looked as if she wished for courage enough to join in it and sometimes did venture a short sentence when there was least danger of its being heard ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth soon saw that she was herself closely watched by miss bingley and that she could not speak a word especially to miss darcy without calling her attention this observation would not have prevented her from trying to talk to the latter had they not been seated at an inconvenient distance but she was not sorry to be spared the necessity of saying much her own thoughts were employing her she expected every moment that some of the gentlemen would enter the room she wished she feared that the master of the house might be amongst them and whether she wished or feared it most she could scarcely determine after sitting in this manner a quarter of an hour without hearing miss bingleys voice elizabeth was roused by receiving from her a cold enquiry after the health of her family she answered with equal indifference and brevity and the other said no more ,Pride and Prejudice
the next variation which their visit afforded was produced by the entrance of servants with cold meat cake and a variety of all the finest fruits in season but this did not take place till after many a significant look and smile from mrs annesley to miss darcy had been given to remind her of her post there was now employment for the whole partyfor though they could not all talk they could all eat and the beautiful pyramids of grapes nectarines and peaches soon collected them round the table ,Pride and Prejudice
while thus engaged elizabeth had a fair opportunity of deciding whether she most feared or wished for the appearance of mr darcy by the feelings which prevailed on his entering the room and then though but a moment before she had believed her wishes to predominate she began to regret that he came ,Pride and Prejudice
he had been some time with mr gardiner who with two or three other gentlemen from the house was engaged by the river and had left him only on learning that the ladies of the family intended a visit to georgiana that morning no sooner did he appear than elizabeth wisely resolved to be perfectly easy and unembarrassed a resolution the more necessary to be made but perhaps not the more easily kept because she saw that the suspicions of the whole party were awakened against them and that there was scarcely an eye which did not watch his behaviour when he first came into the room in no countenance was attentive curiosity so strongly marked as in miss bingleys in spite of the smiles which overspread her face whenever she spoke to one of its objects for jealousy had not yet made her desperate and her attentions to mr darcy were by no means over miss darcy on her brothers entrance exerted herself much more to talk and elizabeth saw that he was anxious for his sister and herself to get acquainted and forwarded as much as possible every attempt at conversation on either side miss bingley saw all this likewise and in the imprudence of anger took the first opportunity of saying with sneering civility ,Pride and Prejudice
in darcys presence she dared not mention wickhams name but elizabeth instantly comprehended that he was uppermost in her thoughts and the various recollections connected with him gave her a moments distress but exerting herself vigorously to repel the illnatured attack she presently answered the question in a tolerably detached tone while she spoke an involuntary glance showed her darcy with a heightened complexion earnestly looking at her and his sister overcome with confusion and unable to lift up her eyes had miss bingley known what pain she was then giving her beloved friend she undoubtedly would have refrained from the hint but she had merely intended to discompose elizabeth by bringing forward the idea of a man to whom she believed her partial to make her betray a sensibility which might injure her in darcys opinion and perhaps to remind the latter of all the follies and absurdities by which some part of her family were connected with that corps not a syllable had ever reached her of miss darcys meditated elopement to no creature had it been revealed where secrecy was possible except to elizabeth and from all bingleys connections her brother was particularly anxious to conceal it from the very wish which elizabeth had long ago attributed to him of their becoming hereafter her own he had certainly formed such a plan and without meaning that it should affect his endeavour to separate him from miss bennet it is probable that it might add something to his lively concern for the welfare of his friend ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths collected behaviour however soon quieted his emotion and as miss bingley vexed and disappointed dared not approach nearer to wickham georgiana also recovered in time though not enough to be able to speak any more her brother whose eye she feared to meet scarcely recollected her interest in the affair and the very circumstance which had been designed to turn his thoughts from elizabeth seemed to have fixed them on her more and more cheerfully ,Pride and Prejudice
their visit did not continue long after the question and answer above mentioned and while mr darcy was attending them to their carriage miss bingley was venting her feelings in criticisms on elizabeths person behaviour and dress but georgiana would not join her her brothers recommendation was enough to ensure her favour his judgement could not err and he had spoken in such terms of elizabeth as to leave georgiana without the power of finding her otherwise than lovely and amiable when darcy returned to the saloon miss bingley could not help repeating to him some part of what she had been saying to his sister ,Pride and Prejudice
how very ill miss eliza bennet looks this morning mr darcy she cried i never in my life saw anyone so much altered as she is since the winter she is grown so brown and coarse louisa and i were agreeing that we should not have known her again ,Pride and Prejudice
however little mr darcy might have liked such an address he contented himself with coolly replying that he perceived no other alteration than her being rather tanned no miraculous consequence of travelling in the summer ,Pride and Prejudice
for my own part she rejoined i must confess that i never could see any beauty in her her face is too thin her complexion has no brilliancy and her features are not at all handsome her nose wants characterthere is nothing marked in its lines her teeth are tolerable but not out of the common way and as for her eyes which have sometimes been called so fine i could never see anything extraordinary in them they have a sharp shrewish look which i do not like at all and in her air altogether there is a selfsufficiency without fashion which is intolerable ,Pride and Prejudice
persuaded as miss bingley was that darcy admired elizabeth this was not the best method of recommending herself but angry people are not always wise and in seeing him at last look somewhat nettled she had all the success she expected he was resolutely silent however and from a determination of making him speak she continued ,Pride and Prejudice
i remember when we first knew her in hertfordshire how amazed we all were to find that she was a reputed beauty and i particularly recollect your saying one night after they had been dining at netherfield she a beautyi should as soon call her mother a wit but afterwards she seemed to improve on you and i believe you thought her rather pretty at one time ,Pride and Prejudice
yes replied darcy who could contain himself no longer but that was only when i first saw her for it is many months since i have considered her as one of the handsomest women of my acquaintance ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner and elizabeth talked of all that had occurred during their visit as they returned except what had particularly interested them both the look and behaviour of everybody they had seen were discussed except of the person who had mostly engaged their attention they talked of his sister his friends his house his fruitof everything but himself yet elizabeth was longing to know what mrs gardiner thought of him and mrs gardiner would have been highly gratified by her nieces beginning the subject ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth had been a good deal disappointed in not finding a letter from jane on their first arrival at lambton and this disappointment had been renewed on each of the mornings that had now been spent there but on the third her repining was over and her sister justified by the receipt of two letters from her at once on one of which was marked that it had been missent elsewhere elizabeth was not surprised at it as jane had written the direction remarkably ill ,Pride and Prejudice
they had just been preparing to walk as the letters came in and her uncle and aunt leaving her to enjoy them in quiet set off by themselves the one missent must first be attended to it had been written five days ago the beginning contained an account of all their little parties and engagements with such news as the country afforded but the latter half which was dated a day later and written in evident agitation gave more important intelligence it was to this effect ,Pride and Prejudice
since writing the above dearest lizzy something has occurred of a most unexpected and serious nature but i am afraid of alarming yoube assured that we are all well what i have to say relates to poor lydia an express came at twelve last night just as we were all gone to bed from colonel forster to inform us that she was gone off to scotland with one of his officers to own the truth with wickham imagine our surprise to kitty however it does not seem so wholly unexpected i am very very sorry so imprudent a match on both sides but i am willing to hope the best and that his character has been misunderstood thoughtless and indiscreet i can easily believe him but this step and let us rejoice over it marks nothing bad at heart his choice is disinterested at least for he must know my father can give her nothing our poor mother is sadly grieved my father bears it better how thankful am i that we never let them know what has been said against him we must forget it ourselves they were off saturday night about twelve as is conjectured but were not missed till yesterday morning at eight the express was sent off directly my dear lizzy they must have passed within ten miles of us colonel forster gives us reason to expect him here soon lydia left a few lines for his wife informing her of their intention i must conclude for i cannot be long from my poor mother i am afraid you will not be able to make it out but i hardly know what i have written ,Pride and Prejudice
without allowing herself time for consideration and scarcely knowing what she felt elizabeth on finishing this letter instantly seized the other and opening it with the utmost impatience read as follows it had been written a day later than the conclusion of the first ,Pride and Prejudice
by this time my dearest sister you have received my hurried letter i wish this may be more intelligible but though not confined for time my head is so bewildered that i cannot answer for being coherent dearest lizzy i hardly know what i would write but i have bad news for you and it cannot be delayed imprudent as the marriage between mr wickham and our poor lydia would be we are now anxious to be assured it has taken place for there is but too much reason to fear they are not gone to scotland colonel forster came yesterday having left brighton the day before not many hours after the express though lydias short letter to mrs f gave them to understand that they were going to gretna green something was dropped by denny expressing his belief that w never intended to go there or to marry lydia at all which was repeated to colonel f who instantly taking the alarm set off from b intending to trace their route he did trace them easily to clapham but no further for on entering that place they removed into a hackney coach and dismissed the chaise that brought them from epsom all that is known after this is that they were seen to continue the london road i know not what to think after making every possible enquiry on that side london colonel f came on into hertfordshire anxiously renewing them at all the turnpikes and at the inns in barnet and hatfield but without any successno such people had been seen to pass through with the kindest concern he came on to longbourn and broke his apprehensions to us in a manner most creditable to his heart i am sincerely grieved for him and mrs f but no one can throw any blame on them our distress my dear lizzy is very great my father and mother believe the worst but i cannot think so ill of him many circumstances might make it more eligible for them to be married privately in town than to pursue their first plan and even if he could form such a design against a young woman of lydias connections which is not likely can i suppose her so lost to everything impossible i grieve to find however that colonel f is not disposed to depend upon their marriage he shook his head when i expressed my hopes and said he feared w was not a man to be trusted my poor mother is really ill and keeps her room could she exert herself it would be better but this is not to be expected and as to my father i never in my life saw him so affected poor kitty has anger for having concealed their attachment but as it was a matter of confidence one cannot wonder i am truly glad dearest lizzy that you have been spared something of these distressing scenes but now as the first shock is over shall i own that i long for your return i am not so selfish however as to press for it if inconvenient adieu i take up my pen again to do what i have just told you i would not but circumstances are such that i cannot help earnestly begging you all to come here as soon as possible i know my dear uncle and aunt so well that i am not afraid of requesting it though i have still something more to ask of the former my father is going to london with colonel forster instantly to try to discover her what he means to do i am sure i know not but his excessive distress will not allow him to pursue any measure in the best and safest way and colonel forster is obliged to be at brighton again tomorrow evening in such an exigence my uncles advice and assistance would be everything in the world he will immediately comprehend what i must feel and i rely upon his goodness ,Pride and Prejudice
oh where where is my uncle cried elizabeth darting from her seat as she finished the letter in eagerness to follow him without losing a moment of the time so precious but as she reached the door it was opened by a servant and mr darcy appeared her pale face and impetuous manner made him start and before he could recover himself to speak she in whose mind every idea was superseded by lydias situation hastily exclaimed i beg your pardon but i must leave you i must find mr gardiner this moment on business that cannot be delayed i have not an instant to lose ,Pride and Prejudice
good god what is the matter cried he with more feeling than politeness then recollecting himself i will not detain you a minute but let me or let the servant go after mr and mrs gardiner you are not well enough you cannot go yourself ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth hesitated but her knees trembled under her and she felt how little would be gained by her attempting to pursue them calling back the servant therefore she commissioned him though in so breathless an accent as made her almost unintelligible to fetch his master and mistress home instantly ,Pride and Prejudice
on his quitting the room she sat down unable to support herself and looking so miserably ill that it was impossible for darcy to leave her or to refrain from saying in a tone of gentleness and commiseration let me call your maid is there nothing you could take to give you present relief a glass of wine shall i get you one you are very ill ,Pride and Prejudice
no i thank you she replied endeavouring to recover herself there is nothing the matter with me i am quite well i am only distressed by some dreadful news which i have just received from longbourn ,Pride and Prejudice
she burst into tears as she alluded to it and for a few minutes could not speak another word darcy in wretched suspense could only say something indistinctly of his concern and observe her in compassionate silence at length she spoke again i have just had a letter from jane with such dreadful news it cannot be concealed from anyone my younger sister has left all her friendshas eloped has thrown herself into the power ofof mr wickham they are gone off together from brighton you know him too well to doubt the rest she has no money no connections nothing that can tempt him toshe is lost for ever ,Pride and Prejudice
darcy was fixed in astonishment when i consider she added in a yet more agitated voice that i might have prevented it i who knew what he was had i but explained some part of it onlysome part of what i learnt to my own family had his character been known this could not have happened but it is allall too late now ,Pride and Prejudice
my father is gone to london and jane has written to beg my uncles immediate assistance and we shall be off i hope in halfanhour but nothing can be donei know very well that nothing can be done how is such a man to be worked on how are they even to be discovered i have not the smallest hope it is every way horrible ,Pride and Prejudice
darcy made no answer he seemed scarcely to hear her and was walking up and down the room in earnest meditation his brow contracted his air gloomy elizabeth soon observed and instantly understood it her power was sinking everything must sink under such a proof of family weakness such an assurance of the deepest disgrace she could neither wonder nor condemn but the belief of his selfconquest brought nothing consolatory to her bosom afforded no palliation of her distress it was on the contrary exactly calculated to make her understand her own wishes and never had she so honestly felt that she could have loved him as now when all love must be vain ,Pride and Prejudice
but self though it would intrude could not engross her lydiathe humiliation the misery she was bringing on them all soon swallowed up every private care and covering her face with her handkerchief elizabeth was soon lost to everything else and after a pause of several minutes was only recalled to a sense of her situation by the voice of her companion who in a manner which though it spoke compassion spoke likewise restraint said i am afraid you have been long desiring my absence nor have i anything to plead in excuse of my stay but real though unavailing concern would to heaven that anything could be either said or done on my part that might offer consolation to such distress but i will not torment you with vain wishes which may seem purposely to ask for your thanks this unfortunate affair will i fear prevent my sisters having the pleasure of seeing you at pemberley today ,Pride and Prejudice
oh yes be so kind as to apologise for us to miss darcy say that urgent business calls us home immediately conceal the unhappy truth as long as it is possible i know it cannot be long ,Pride and Prejudice
he readily assured her of his secrecy again expressed his sorrow for her distress wished it a happier conclusion than there was at present reason to hope and leaving his compliments for her relations with only one serious parting look went away ,Pride and Prejudice
as he quitted the room elizabeth felt how improbable it was that they should ever see each other again on such terms of cordiality as had marked their several meetings in derbyshire and as she threw a retrospective glance over the whole of their acquaintance so full of contradictions and varieties sighed at the perverseness of those feelings which would now have promoted its continuance and would formerly have rejoiced in its termination ,Pride and Prejudice
if gratitude and esteem are good foundations of affection elizabeths change of sentiment will be neither improbable nor faulty but if otherwiseif regard springing from such sources is unreasonable or unnatural in comparison of what is so often described as arising on a first interview with its object and even before two words have been exchanged nothing can be said in her defence except that she had given somewhat of a trial to the latter method in her partiality for wickham and that its ill success might perhaps authorise her to seek the other less interesting mode of attachment be that as it may she saw him go with regret and in this early example of what lydias infamy must produce found additional anguish as she reflected on that wretched business never since reading janes second letter had she entertained a hope of wickhams meaning to marry her no one but jane she thought could flatter herself with such an expectation surprise was the least of her feelings on this development while the contents of the first letter remained in her mind she was all surpriseall astonishment that wickham should marry a girl whom it was impossible he could marry for money and how lydia could ever have attached him had appeared incomprehensible but now it was all too natural for such an attachment as this she might have sufficient charms and though she did not suppose lydia to be deliberately engaging in an elopement without the intention of marriage she had no difficulty in believing that neither her virtue nor her understanding would preserve her from falling an easy prey ,Pride and Prejudice
she had never perceived while the regiment was in hertfordshire that lydia had any partiality for him but she was convinced that lydia wanted only encouragement to attach herself to anybody sometimes one officer sometimes another had been her favourite as their attentions raised them in her opinion her affections had continually been fluctuating but never without an object the mischief of neglect and mistaken indulgence towards such a girloh how acutely did she now feel it ,Pride and Prejudice
she was wild to be at hometo hear to see to be upon the spot to share with jane in the cares that must now fall wholly upon her in a family so deranged a father absent a mother incapable of exertion and requiring constant attendance and though almost persuaded that nothing could be done for lydia her uncles interference seemed of the utmost importance and till he entered the room her impatience was severe mr and mrs gardiner had hurried back in alarm supposing by the servants account that their niece was taken suddenly ill but satisfying them instantly on that head she eagerly communicated the cause of their summons reading the two letters aloud and dwelling on the postscript of the last with trembling energy though lydia had never been a favourite with them mr and mrs gardiner could not but be deeply afflicted not lydia only but all were concerned in it and after the first exclamations of surprise and horror mr gardiner promised every assistance in his power elizabeth though expecting no less thanked him with tears of gratitude and all three being actuated by one spirit everything relating to their journey was speedily settled they were to be off as soon as possible but what is to be done about pemberley cried mrs gardiner john told us mr darcy was here when you sent for us was it so ,Pride and Prejudice
but wishes were vain or at least could only serve to amuse her in the hurry and confusion of the following hour had elizabeth been at leisure to be idle she would have remained certain that all employment was impossible to one so wretched as herself but she had her share of business as well as her aunt and amongst the rest there were notes to be written to all their friends at lambton with false excuses for their sudden departure an hour however saw the whole completed and mr gardiner meanwhile having settled his account at the inn nothing remained to be done but to go and elizabeth after all the misery of the morning found herself in a shorter space of time than she could have supposed seated in the carriage and on the road to longbourn ,Pride and Prejudice
i have been thinking it over again elizabeth said her uncle as they drove from the town and really upon serious consideration i am much more inclined than i was to judge as your eldest sister does on the matter it appears to me so very unlikely that any young man should form such a design against a girl who is by no means unprotected or friendless and who was actually staying in his colonels family that i am strongly inclined to hope the best could he expect that her friends would not step forward could he expect to be noticed again by the regiment after such an affront to colonel forster his temptation is not adequate to the risk ,Pride and Prejudice
upon my word said mrs gardiner i begin to be of your uncles opinion it is really too great a violation of decency honour and interest for him to be guilty of i cannot think so very ill of wickham can you yourself lizzy so wholly give him up as to believe him capable of it ,Pride and Prejudice
not perhaps of neglecting his own interest but of every other neglect i can believe him capable if indeed it should be so but i dare not hope it why should they not go on to scotland if that had been the case ,Pride and Prejudice
well thensupposing them to be in london they may be there though for the purpose of concealment for no more exceptional purpose it is not likely that money should be very abundant on either side and it might strike them that they could be more economically though less expeditiously married in london than in scotland ,Pride and Prejudice
but why all this secrecy why any fear of detection why must their marriage be private oh no nothis is not likely his most particular friend you see by janes account was persuaded of his never intending to marry her wickham will never marry a woman without some money he cannot afford it and what claims has lydiawhat attraction has she beyond youth health and good humour that could make him for her sake forego every chance of benefiting himself by marrying well as to what restraint the apprehensions of disgrace in the corps might throw on a dishonourable elopement with her i am not able to judge for i know nothing of the effects that such a step might produce but as to your other objection i am afraid it will hardly hold good lydia has no brothers to step forward and he might imagine from my fathers behaviour from his indolence and the little attention he has ever seemed to give to what was going forward in his family that he would do as little and think as little about it as any father could do in such a matter ,Pride and Prejudice
it does seem and it is most shocking indeed replied elizabeth with tears in her eyes that a sisters sense of decency and virtue in such a point should admit of doubt but really i know not what to say perhaps i am not doing her justice but she is very young she has never been taught to think on serious subjects and for the last halfyear nay for a twelvemonthshe has been given up to nothing but amusement and vanity she has been allowed to dispose of her time in the most idle and frivolous manner and to adopt any opinions that came in her way since the shire were first quartered in meryton nothing but love flirtation and officers have been in her head she has been doing everything in her power by thinking and talking on the subject to give greaterwhat shall i call it susceptibility to her feelings which are naturally lively enough and we all know that wickham has every charm of person and address that can captivate a woman ,Pride and Prejudice
of whom does jane ever think ill and who is there whatever might be their former conduct that she would think capable of such an attempt till it were proved against them but jane knows as well as i do what wickham really is we both know that he has been profligate in every sense of the word that he has neither integrity nor honour that he is as false and deceitful as he is insinuating ,Pride and Prejudice
i do indeed replied elizabeth colouring i told you the other day of his infamous behaviour to mr darcy and you yourself when last at longbourn heard in what manner he spoke of the man who had behaved with such forbearance and liberality towards him and there are other circumstances which i am not at libertywhich it is not worth while to relate but his lies about the whole pemberley family are endless from what he said of miss darcy i was thoroughly prepared to see a proud reserved disagreeable girl yet he knew to the contrary himself he must know that she was as amiable and unpretending as we have found her ,Pride and Prejudice
oh yesthat that is the worst of all till i was in kent and saw so much both of mr darcy and his relation colonel fitzwilliam i was ignorant of the truth myself and when i returned home the shire was to leave meryton in a week or fortnights time as that was the case neither jane to whom i related the whole nor i thought it necessary to make our knowledge public for of what use could it apparently be to any one that the good opinion which all the neighbourhood had of him should then be overthrown and even when it was settled that lydia should go with mrs forster the necessity of opening her eyes to his character never occurred to me that she could be in any danger from the deception never entered my head that such a consequence as this could ensue you may easily believe was far enough from my thoughts ,Pride and Prejudice
not the slightest i can remember no symptom of affection on either side and had anything of the kind been perceptible you must be aware that ours is not a family on which it could be thrown away when first he entered the corps she was ready enough to admire him but so we all were every girl in or near meryton was out of her senses about him for the first two months but he never distinguished her by any particular attention and consequently after a moderate period of extravagant and wild admiration her fancy for him gave way and others of the regiment who treated her with more distinction again became her favourites ,Pride and Prejudice
it may be easily believed that however little of novelty could be added to their fears hopes and conjectures on this interesting subject by its repeated discussion no other could detain them from it long during the whole of the journey from elizabeths thoughts it was never absent fixed there by the keenest of all anguish selfreproach she could find no interval of ease or forgetfulness ,Pride and Prejudice
they travelled as expeditiously as possible and sleeping one night on the road reached longbourn by dinner time the next day it was a comfort to elizabeth to consider that jane could not have been wearied by long expectations ,Pride and Prejudice
the little gardiners attracted by the sight of a chaise were standing on the steps of the house as they entered the paddock and when the carriage drove up to the door the joyful surprise that lighted up their faces and displayed itself over their whole bodies in a variety of capers and frisks was the first pleasing earnest of their welcome ,Pride and Prejudice
we have heard only twice he wrote me a few lines on wednesday to say that he had arrived in safety and to give me his directions which i particularly begged him to do he merely added that he should not write again till he had something of importance to mention ,Pride and Prejudice
my mother is tolerably well i trust though her spirits are greatly shaken she is up stairs and will have great satisfaction in seeing you all she does not yet leave her dressingroom mary and kitty thank heaven are quite well ,Pride and Prejudice
her sister however assured her of her being perfectly well and their conversation which had been passing while mr and mrs gardiner were engaged with their children was now put an end to by the approach of the whole party jane ran to her uncle and aunt and welcomed and thanked them both with alternate smiles and tears ,Pride and Prejudice
when they were all in the drawingroom the questions which elizabeth had already asked were of course repeated by the others and they soon found that jane had no intelligence to give the sanguine hope of good however which the benevolence of her heart suggested had not yet deserted her she still expected that it would all end well and that every morning would bring some letter either from lydia or her father to explain their proceedings and perhaps announce their marriage ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet to whose apartment they all repaired after a few minutes conversation together received them exactly as might be expected with tears and lamentations of regret invectives against the villainous conduct of wickham and complaints of her own sufferings and illusage blaming everybody but the person to whose illjudging indulgence the errors of her daughter must principally be owing ,Pride and Prejudice
if i had been able said she to carry my point in going to brighton with all my family this would not have happened but poor dear lydia had nobody to take care of her why did the forsters ever let her go out of their sight i am sure there was some great neglect or other on their side for she is not the kind of girl to do such a thing if she had been well looked after i always thought they were very unfit to have the charge of her but i was overruled as i always am poor dear child and now heres mr bennet gone away and i know he will fight wickham wherever he meets him and then he will be killed and what is to become of us all the collinses will turn us out before he is cold in his grave and if you are not kind to us brother i do not know what we shall do ,Pride and Prejudice
they all exclaimed against such terrific ideas and mr gardiner after general assurances of his affection for her and all her family told her that he meant to be in london the very next day and would assist mr bennet in every endeavour for recovering lydia ,Pride and Prejudice
do not give way to useless alarm added he though it is right to be prepared for the worst there is no occasion to look on it as certain it is not quite a week since they left brighton in a few days more we may gain some news of them and till we know that they are not married and have no design of marrying do not let us give the matter over as lost as soon as i get to town i shall go to my brother and make him come home with me to gracechurch street and then we may consult together as to what is to be done ,Pride and Prejudice
oh my dear brother replied mrs bennet that is exactly what i could most wish for and now do when you get to town find them out wherever they may be and if they are not married already make them marry and as for wedding clothes do not let them wait for that but tell lydia she shall have as much money as she chooses to buy them after they are married and above all keep mr bennet from fighting tell him what a dreadful state i am in that i am frighted out of my witsand have such tremblings such flutterings all over mesuch spasms in my side and pains in my head and such beatings at heart that i can get no rest by night nor by day and tell my dear lydia not to give any directions about her clothes till she has seen me for she does not know which are the best warehouses oh brother how kind you are i know you will contrive it all ,Pride and Prejudice
but mr gardiner though he assured her again of his earnest endeavours in the cause could not avoid recommending moderation to her as well in her hopes as her fear and after talking with her in this manner till dinner was on the table they all left her to vent all her feelings on the housekeeper who attended in the absence of her daughters ,Pride and Prejudice
though her brother and sister were persuaded that there was no real occasion for such a seclusion from the family they did not attempt to oppose it for they knew that she had not prudence enough to hold her tongue before the servants while they waited at table and judged it better that one only of the household and the one whom they could most trust should comprehend all her fears and solicitude on the subject ,Pride and Prejudice
in the diningroom they were soon joined by mary and kitty who had been too busily engaged in their separate apartments to make their appearance before one came from her books and the other from her toilette the faces of both however were tolerably calm and no change was visible in either except that the loss of her favourite sister or the anger which she had herself incurred in this business had given more of fretfulness than usual to the accents of kitty as for mary she was mistress enough of herself to whisper to elizabeth with a countenance of grave reflection soon after they were seated at table ,Pride and Prejudice
then perceiving in elizabeth no inclination of replying she added unhappy as the event must be for lydia we may draw from it this useful lesson that loss of virtue in a female is irretrievable that one false step involves her in endless ruin that her reputation is no less brittle than it is beautiful and that she cannot be too much guarded in her behaviour towards the undeserving of the other sex ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth lifted up her eyes in amazement but was too much oppressed to make any reply mary however continued to console herself with such kind of moral extractions from the evil before them ,Pride and Prejudice
in the afternoon the two elder miss bennets were able to be for halfanhour by themselves and elizabeth instantly availed herself of the opportunity of making many enquiries which jane was equally eager to satisfy after joining in general lamentations over the dreadful sequel of this event which elizabeth considered as all but certain and miss bennet could not assert to be wholly impossible the former continued the subject by saying but tell me all and everything about it which i have not already heard give me further particulars what did colonel forster say had they no apprehension of anything before the elopement took place they must have seen them together for ever ,Pride and Prejudice
colonel forster did own that he had often suspected some partiality especially on lydias side but nothing to give him any alarm i am so grieved for him his behaviour was attentive and kind to the utmost he was coming to us in order to assure us of his concern before he had any idea of their not being gone to scotland when that apprehension first got abroad it hastened his journey ,Pride and Prejudice
yes but when questioned by him denny denied knowing anything of their plans and would not give his real opinion about it he did not repeat his persuasion of their not marryingand from that i am inclined to hope he might have been misunderstood before ,Pride and Prejudice
how was it possible that such an idea should enter our brains i felt a little uneasya little fearful of my sisters happiness with him in marriage because i knew that his conduct had not been always quite right my father and mother knew nothing of that they only felt how imprudent a match it must be kitty then owned with a very natural triumph on knowing more than the rest of us that in lydias last letter she had prepared her for such a step she had known it seems of their being in love with each other many weeks ,Pride and Prejudice
i must confess that he did not speak so well of wickham as he formerly did he believed him to be imprudent and extravagant and since this sad affair has taken place it is said that he left meryton greatly in debt but i hope this may be false ,Pride and Prejudice
perhaps it would have been better replied her sister but to expose the former faults of any person without knowing what their present feelings were seemed unjustifiable we acted with the best intentions ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear harriet you will laugh when you know where i am gone and i cannot help laughing myself at your surprise tomorrow morning as soon as i am missed i am going to gretna green and if you cannot guess with who i shall think you a simpleton for there is but one man in the world i love and he is an angel i should never be happy without him so think it no harm to be off you need not send them word at longbourn of my going if you do not like it for it will make the surprise the greater when i write to them and sign my name lydia wickham what a good joke it will be i can hardly write for laughing pray make my excuses to pratt for not keeping my engagement and dancing with him tonight tell him i hope he will excuse me when he knows all and tell him i will dance with him at the next ball we meet with great pleasure i shall send for my clothes when i get to longbourn but i wish you would tell sally to mend a great slit in my worked muslin gown before they are packed up goodbye give my love to colonel forster i hope you will drink to our good journey ,Pride and Prejudice
oh thoughtless thoughtless lydia cried elizabeth when she had finished it what a letter is this to be written at such a moment but at least it shows that she was serious on the subject of their journey whatever he might afterwards persuade her to it was not on her side a scheme of infamy my poor father how he must have felt it ,Pride and Prejudice
i do not know i hope there was but to be guarded at such a time is very difficult my mother was in hysterics and though i endeavoured to give her every assistance in my power i am afraid i did not do so much as i might have done but the horror of what might possibly happen almost took from me my faculties ,Pride and Prejudice
mary and kitty have been very kind and would have shared in every fatigue i am sure but i did not think it right for either of them kitty is slight and delicate and mary studies so much that her hours of repose should not be broken in on my aunt phillips came to longbourn on tuesday after my father went away and was so good as to stay till thursday with me she was of great use and comfort to us all and lady lucas has been very kind she walked here on wednesday morning to condole with us and offered her services or any of her daughters if they should be of use to us ,Pride and Prejudice
she had better have stayed at home cried elizabeth perhaps she meant well but under such a misfortune as this one cannot see too little of ones neighbours assistance is impossible condolence insufferable let them triumph over us at a distance and be satisfied ,Pride and Prejudice
he meant i believe replied jane to go to epsom the place where they last changed horses see the postilions and try if anything could be made out from them his principal object must be to discover the number of the hackney coach which took them from clapham it had come with a fare from london and as he thought that the circumstance of a gentleman and ladys removing from one carriage into another might be remarked he meant to make enquiries at clapham if he could anyhow discover at what house the coachman had before set down his fare he determined to make enquiries there and hoped it might not be impossible to find out the stand and number of the coach i do not know of any other designs that he had formed but he was in such a hurry to be gone and his spirits so greatly discomposed that i had difficulty in finding out even so much as this ,Pride and Prejudice
the whole party were in hopes of a letter from mr bennet the next morning but the post came in without bringing a single line from him his family knew him to be on all common occasions a most negligent and dilatory correspondent but at such a time they had hoped for exertion they were forced to conclude that he had no pleasing intelligence to send but even of that they would have been glad to be certain mr gardiner had waited only for the letters before he set off ,Pride and Prejudice
when he was gone they were certain at least of receiving constant information of what was going on and their uncle promised at parting to prevail on mr bennet to return to longbourn as soon as he could to the great consolation of his sister who considered it as the only security for her husbands not being killed in a duel ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner and the children were to remain in hertfordshire a few days longer as the former thought her presence might be serviceable to her nieces she shared in their attendance on mrs bennet and was a great comfort to them in their hours of freedom their other aunt also visited them frequently and always as she said with the design of cheering and heartening them upthough as she never came without reporting some fresh instance of wickhams extravagance or irregularity she seldom went away without leaving them more dispirited than she found them ,Pride and Prejudice
all meryton seemed striving to blacken the man who but three months before had been almost an angel of light he was declared to be in debt to every tradesman in the place and his intrigues all honoured with the title of seduction had been extended into every tradesmans family everybody declared that he was the wickedest young man in the world and everybody began to find out that they had always distrusted the appearance of his goodness elizabeth though she did not credit above half of what was said believed enough to make her former assurance of her sisters ruin more certain and even jane who believed still less of it became almost hopeless more especially as the time was now come when if they had gone to scotland which she had never before entirely despaired of they must in all probability have gained some news of them ,Pride and Prejudice
mr gardiner left longbourn on sunday on tuesday his wife received a letter from him it told them that on his arrival he had immediately found out his brother and persuaded him to come to gracechurch street that mr bennet had been to epsom and clapham before his arrival but without gaining any satisfactory information and that he was now determined to enquire at all the principal hotels in town as mr bennet thought it possible they might have gone to one of them on their first coming to london before they procured lodgings mr gardiner himself did not expect any success from this measure but as his brother was eager in it he meant to assist him in pursuing it he added that mr bennet seemed wholly disinclined at present to leave london and promised to write again very soon there was also a postscript to this effect ,Pride and Prejudice
i have written to colonel forster to desire him to find out if possible from some of the young mans intimates in the regiment whether wickham has any relations or connections who would be likely to know in what part of town he has now concealed himself if there were anyone that one could apply to with a probability of gaining such a clue as that it might be of essential consequence at present we have nothing to guide us colonel forster will i dare say do everything in his power to satisfy us on this head but on second thoughts perhaps lizzy could tell us what relations he has now living better than any other person ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was at no loss to understand from whence this deference to her authority proceeded but it was not in her power to give any information of so satisfactory a nature as the compliment deserved she had never heard of his having had any relations except a father and mother both of whom had been dead many years it was possible however that some of his companions in the shire might be able to give more information and though she was not very sanguine in expecting it the application was a something to look forward to ,Pride and Prejudice
every day at longbourn was now a day of anxiety but the most anxious part of each was when the post was expected the arrival of letters was the grand object of every mornings impatience through letters whatever of good or bad was to be told would be communicated and every succeeding day was expected to bring some news of importance ,Pride and Prejudice
but before they heard again from mr gardiner a letter arrived for their father from a different quarter from mr collins which as jane had received directions to open all that came for him in his absence she accordingly read and elizabeth who knew what curiosities his letters always were looked over her and read it likewise it was as follows ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear sir i feel myself called upon by our relationship and my situation in life to condole with you on the grievous affliction you are now suffering under of which we were yesterday informed by a letter from hertfordshire be assured my dear sir that mrs collins and myself sincerely sympathise with you and all your respectable family in your present distress which must be of the bitterest kind because proceeding from a cause which no time can remove no arguments shall be wanting on my part that can alleviate so severe a misfortuneor that may comfort you under a circumstance that must be of all others the most afflicting to a parents mind the death of your daughter would have been a blessing in comparison of this and it is the more to be lamented because there is reason to suppose as my dear charlotte informs me that this licentiousness of behaviour in your daughter has proceeded from a faulty degree of indulgence though at the same time for the consolation of yourself and mrs bennet i am inclined to think that her own disposition must be naturally bad or she could not be guilty of such an enormity at so early an age howsoever that may be you are grievously to be pitied in which opinion i am not only joined by mrs collins but likewise by lady catherine and her daughter to whom i have related the affair they agree with me in apprehending that this false step in one daughter will be injurious to the fortunes of all the others for who as lady catherine herself condescendingly says will connect themselves with such a family and this consideration leads me moreover to reflect with augmented satisfaction on a certain event of last november for had it been otherwise i must have been involved in all your sorrow and disgrace let me then advise you dear sir to console yourself as much as possible to throw off your unworthy child from your affection for ever and leave her to reap the fruits of her own heinous offense ,Pride and Prejudice
mr gardiner did not write again till he had received an answer from colonel forster and then he had nothing of a pleasant nature to send it was not known that wickham had a single relationship with whom he kept up any connection and it was certain that he had no near one living his former acquaintances had been numerous but since he had been in the militia it did not appear that he was on terms of particular friendship with any of them there was no one therefore who could be pointed out as likely to give any news of him and in the wretched state of his own finances there was a very powerful motive for secrecy in addition to his fear of discovery by lydias relations for it had just transpired that he had left gaming debts behind him to a very considerable amount colonel forster believed that more than a thousand pounds would be necessary to clear his expenses at brighton he owed a good deal in town but his debts of honour were still more formidable mr gardiner did not attempt to conceal these particulars from the longbourn family jane heard them with horror a gamester she cried this is wholly unexpected i had not an idea of it ,Pride and Prejudice
mr gardiner added in his letter that they might expect to see their father at home on the following day which was saturday rendered spiritless by the illsuccess of all their endeavours he had yielded to his brotherinlaws entreaty that he would return to his family and leave it to him to do whatever occasion might suggest to be advisable for continuing their pursuit when mrs bennet was told of this she did not express so much satisfaction as her children expected considering what her anxiety for his life had been before ,Pride and Prejudice
as mrs gardiner began to wish to be at home it was settled that she and the children should go to london at the same time that mr bennet came from it the coach therefore took them the first stage of their journey and brought its master back to longbourn ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs gardiner went away in all the perplexity about elizabeth and her derbyshire friend that had attended her from that part of the world his name had never been voluntarily mentioned before them by her niece and the kind of halfexpectation which mrs gardiner had formed of their being followed by a letter from him had ended in nothing elizabeth had received none since her return that could come from pemberley ,Pride and Prejudice
the present unhappy state of the family rendered any other excuse for the lowness of her spirits unnecessary nothing therefore could be fairly conjectured from that though elizabeth who was by this time tolerably well acquainted with her own feelings was perfectly aware that had she known nothing of darcy she could have borne the dread of lydias infamy somewhat better it would have spared her she thought one sleepless night out of two ,Pride and Prejudice
when mr bennet arrived he had all the appearance of his usual philosophic composure he said as little as he had ever been in the habit of saying made no mention of the business that had taken him away and it was some time before his daughters had courage to speak of it ,Pride and Prejudice
it was not till the afternoon when he had joined them at tea that elizabeth ventured to introduce the subject and then on her briefly expressing her sorrow for what he must have endured he replied say nothing of that who should suffer but myself it has been my own doing and i ought to feel it ,Pride and Prejudice
you may well warn me against such an evil human nature is so prone to fall into it no lizzy let me once in my life feel how much i have been to blame i am not afraid of being overpowered by the impression it will pass away soon enough ,Pride and Prejudice
this is a parade he cried which does one good it gives such an elegance to misfortune another day i will do the same i will sit in my library in my nightcap and powdering gown and give as much trouble as i can or perhaps i may defer it till kitty runs away ,Pride and Prejudice
you go to brighton i would not trust you so near it as eastbourne for fifty pounds no kitty i have at last learnt to be cautious and you will feel the effects of it no officer is ever to enter into my house again nor even to pass through the village balls will be absolutely prohibited unless you stand up with one of your sisters and you are never to stir out of doors till you can prove that you have spent ten minutes of every day in a rational manner ,Pride and Prejudice
two days after mr bennets return as jane and elizabeth were walking together in the shrubbery behind the house they saw the housekeeper coming towards them and concluding that she came to call them to their mother went forward to meet her but instead of the expected summons when they approached her she said to miss bennet i beg your pardon madam for interrupting you but i was in hopes you might have got some good news from town so i took the liberty of coming to ask ,Pride and Prejudice
away ran the girls too eager to get in to have time for speech they ran through the vestibule into the breakfastroom from thence to the library their father was in neither and they were on the point of seeking him up stairs with their mother when they were met by the butler who said ,Pride and Prejudice
upon this information they instantly passed through the hall once more and ran across the lawn after their father who was deliberately pursuing his way towards a small wood on one side of the paddock ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear brother at last i am able to send you some tidings of my niece and such as upon the whole i hope it will give you satisfaction soon after you left me on saturday i was fortunate enough to find out in what part of london they were the particulars i reserve till we meet it is enough to know they are discovered i have seen them both then it is as i always hoped cried jane they are married ,Pride and Prejudice
i have seen them both they are not married nor can i find there was any intention of being so but if you are willing to perform the engagements which i have ventured to make on your side i hope it will not be long before they are all that is required of you is to assure to your daughter by settlement her equal share of the five thousand pounds secured among your children after the decease of yourself and my sister and moreover to enter into an engagement of allowing her during your life one hundred pounds per annum these are conditions which considering everything i had no hesitation in complying with as far as i thought myself privileged for you i shall send this by express that no time may be lost in bringing me your answer you will easily comprehend from these particulars that mr wickhams circumstances are not so hopeless as they are generally believed to be the world has been deceived in that respect and i am happy to say there will be some little money even when all his debts are discharged to settle on my niece in addition to her own fortune if as i conclude will be the case you send me full powers to act in your name throughout the whole of this business i will immediately give directions to haggerston for preparing a proper settlement there will not be the smallest occasion for your coming to town again therefore stay quiet at longbourn and depend on my diligence and care send back your answer as fast as you can and be careful to write explicitly we have judged it best that my niece should be married from this house of which i hope you will approve she comes to us today i shall write again as soon as anything more is determined on yours etc ,Pride and Prejudice
yes yes they must marry there is nothing else to be done but there are two things that i want very much to know one is how much money your uncle has laid down to bring it about and the other how am i ever to pay him ,Pride and Prejudice
that is very true said elizabeth though it had not occurred to me before his debts to be discharged and something still to remain oh it must be my uncles doings generous good man i am afraid he has distressed himself a small sum could not do all this ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennet made no answer and each of them deep in thought continued silent till they reached the house their father then went on to the library to write and the girls walked into the breakfastroom ,Pride and Prejudice
and they are really to be married cried elizabeth as soon as they were by themselves how strange this is and for this we are to be thankful that they should marry small as is their chance of happiness and wretched as is his character we are forced to rejoice oh lydia ,Pride and Prejudice
i comfort myself with thinking replied jane that he certainly would not marry lydia if he had not a real regard for her though our kind uncle has done something towards clearing him i cannot believe that ten thousand pounds or anything like it has been advanced he has children of his own and may have more how could he spare half ten thousand pounds ,Pride and Prejudice
if he were ever able to learn what wickhams debts have been said elizabeth and how much is settled on his side on our sister we shall exactly know what mr gardiner has done for them because wickham has not sixpence of his own the kindness of my uncle and aunt can never be requited their taking her home and affording her their personal protection and countenance is such a sacrifice to her advantage as years of gratitude cannot enough acknowledge by this time she is actually with them if such goodness does not make her miserable now she will never deserve to be happy what a meeting for her when she first sees my aunt ,Pride and Prejudice
we must endeavour to forget all that has passed on either side said jane i hope and trust they will yet be happy his consenting to marry her is a proof i will believe that he is come to a right way of thinking their mutual affection will steady them and i flatter myself they will settle so quietly and live in so rational a manner as may in time make their past imprudence forgotten ,Pride and Prejudice
it now occurred to the girls that their mother was in all likelihood perfectly ignorant of what had happened they went to the library therefore and asked their father whether he would not wish them to make it known to her he was writing and without raising his head coolly replied ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth took the letter from his writingtable and they went up stairs together mary and kitty were both with mrs bennet one communication would therefore do for all after a slight preparation for good news the letter was read aloud mrs bennet could hardly contain herself as soon as jane had read mr gardiners hope of lydias being soon married her joy burst forth and every following sentence added to its exuberance she was now in an irritation as violent from delight as she had ever been fidgety from alarm and vexation to know that her daughter would be married was enough she was disturbed by no fear for her felicity nor humbled by any remembrance of her misconduct ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear dear lydia she cried this is delightful indeed she will be married i shall see her again she will be married at sixteen my good kind brother i knew how it would be i knew he would manage everything how i long to see her and to see dear wickham too but the clothes the wedding clothes i will write to my sister gardiner about them directly lizzy my dear run down to your father and ask him how much he will give her stay stay i will go myself ring the bell kitty for hill i will put on my things in a moment my dear dear lydia how merry we shall be together when we meet ,Pride and Prejudice
well cried her mother it is all very right who should do it but her own uncle if he had not had a family of his own i and my children must have had all his money you know and it is the first time we have ever had anything from him except a few presents well i am so happy in a short time i shall have a daughter married mrs wickham how well it sounds and she was only sixteen last june my dear jane i am in such a flutter that i am sure i cant write so i will dictate and you write for me we will settle with your father about the money afterwards but the things should be ordered immediately ,Pride and Prejudice
she was then proceeding to all the particulars of calico muslin and cambric and would shortly have dictated some very plentiful orders had not jane though with some difficulty persuaded her to wait till her father was at leisure to be consulted one days delay she observed would be of small importance and her mother was too happy to be quite so obstinate as usual other schemes too came into her head ,Pride and Prejudice
i will go to meryton said she as soon as i am dressed and tell the good good news to my sister philips and as i come back i can call on lady lucas and mrs long kitty run down and order the carriage an airing would do me a great deal of good i am sure girls can i do anything for you in meryton oh here comes hill my dear hill have you heard the good news miss lydia is going to be married and you shall all have a bowl of punch to make merry at her wedding ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs hill began instantly to express her joy elizabeth received her congratulations amongst the rest and then sick of this folly took refuge in her own room that she might think with freedom ,Pride and Prejudice
poor lydias situation must at best be bad enough but that it was no worse she had need to be thankful she felt it so and though in looking forward neither rational happiness nor worldly prosperity could be justly expected for her sister in looking back to what they had feared only two hours ago she felt all the advantages of what they had gained ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennet had very often wished before this period of his life that instead of spending his whole income he had laid by an annual sum for the better provision of his children and of his wife if she survived him he now wished it more than ever had he done his duty in that respect lydia need not have been indebted to her uncle for whatever of honour or credit could now be purchased for her the satisfaction of prevailing on one of the most worthless young men in great britain to be her husband might then have rested in its proper place ,Pride and Prejudice
he was seriously concerned that a cause of so little advantage to anyone should be forwarded at the sole expense of his brotherinlaw and he was determined if possible to find out the extent of his assistance and to discharge the obligation as soon as he could ,Pride and Prejudice
when first mr bennet had married economy was held to be perfectly useless for of course they were to have a son the son was to join in cutting off the entail as soon as he should be of age and the widow and younger children would by that means be provided for five daughters successively entered the world but yet the son was to come and mrs bennet for many years after lydias birth had been certain that he would this event had at last been despaired of but it was then too late to be saving mrs bennet had no turn for economy and her husbands love of independence had alone prevented their exceeding their income ,Pride and Prejudice
five thousand pounds was settled by marriage articles on mrs bennet and the children but in what proportions it should be divided amongst the latter depended on the will of the parents this was one point with regard to lydia at least which was now to be settled and mr bennet could have no hesitation in acceding to the proposal before him in terms of grateful acknowledgment for the kindness of his brother though expressed most concisely he then delivered on paper his perfect approbation of all that was done and his willingness to fulfil the engagements that had been made for him he had never before supposed that could wickham be prevailed on to marry his daughter it would be done with so little inconvenience to himself as by the present arrangement he would scarcely be ten pounds a year the loser by the hundred that was to be paid them for what with her board and pocket allowance and the continual presents in money which passed to her through her mothers hands lydias expenses had been very little within that sum ,Pride and Prejudice
that it would be done with such trifling exertion on his side too was another very welcome surprise for his wish at present was to have as little trouble in the business as possible when the first transports of rage which had produced his activity in seeking her were over he naturally returned to all his former indolence his letter was soon dispatched for though dilatory in undertaking business he was quick in its execution he begged to know further particulars of what he was indebted to his brother but was too angry with lydia to send any message to her ,Pride and Prejudice
the good news spread quickly through the house and with proportionate speed through the neighbourhood it was borne in the latter with decent philosophy to be sure it would have been more for the advantage of conversation had miss lydia bennet come upon the town or as the happiest alternative been secluded from the world in some distant farmhouse but there was much to be talked of in marrying her and the goodnatured wishes for her welldoing which had proceeded before from all the spiteful old ladies in meryton lost but a little of their spirit in this change of circumstances because with such an husband her misery was considered certain ,Pride and Prejudice
it was a fortnight since mrs bennet had been downstairs but on this happy day she again took her seat at the head of her table and in spirits oppressively high no sentiment of shame gave a damp to her triumph the marriage of a daughter which had been the first object of her wishes since jane was sixteen was now on the point of accomplishment and her thoughts and her words ran wholly on those attendants of elegant nuptials fine muslins new carriages and servants she was busily searching through the neighbourhood for a proper situation for her daughter and without knowing or considering what their income might be rejected many as deficient in size and importance ,Pride and Prejudice
haye park might do said she if the gouldings could quit itor the great house at stoke if the drawingroom were larger but ashworth is too far off i could not bear to have her ten miles from me and as for pulvis lodge the attics are dreadful ,Pride and Prejudice
her husband allowed her to talk on without interruption while the servants remained but when they had withdrawn he said to her mrs bennet before you take any or all of these houses for your son and daughter let us come to a right understanding into one house in this neighbourhood they shall never have admittance i will not encourage the impudence of either by receiving them at longbourn ,Pride and Prejudice
a long dispute followed this declaration but mr bennet was firm it soon led to another and mrs bennet found with amazement and horror that her husband would not advance a guinea to buy clothes for his daughter he protested that she should receive from him no mark of affection whatever on the occasion mrs bennet could hardly comprehend it that his anger could be carried to such a point of inconceivable resentment as to refuse his daughter a privilege without which her marriage would scarcely seem valid exceeded all she could believe possible she was more alive to the disgrace which her want of new clothes must reflect on her daughters nuptials than to any sense of shame at her eloping and living with wickham a fortnight before they took place ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was now most heartily sorry that she had from the distress of the moment been led to make mr darcy acquainted with their fears for her sister for since her marriage would so shortly give the proper termination to the elopement they might hope to conceal its unfavourable beginning from all those who were not immediately on the spot ,Pride and Prejudice
she had no fear of its spreading farther through his means there were few people on whose secrecy she would have more confidently depended but at the same time there was no one whose knowledge of a sisters frailty would have mortified her so muchnot however from any fear of disadvantage from it individually to herself for at any rate there seemed a gulf impassable between them had lydias marriage been concluded on the most honourable terms it was not to be supposed that mr darcy would connect himself with a family where to every other objection would now be added an alliance and relationship of the nearest kind with a man whom he so justly scorned ,Pride and Prejudice
from such a connection she could not wonder that he would shrink the wish of procuring her regard which she had assured herself of his feeling in derbyshire could not in rational expectation survive such a blow as this she was humbled she was grieved she repented though she hardly knew of what she became jealous of his esteem when she could no longer hope to be benefited by it she wanted to hear of him when there seemed the least chance of gaining intelligence she was convinced that she could have been happy with him when it was no longer likely they should meet ,Pride and Prejudice
what a triumph for him as she often thought could he know that the proposals which she had proudly spurned only four months ago would now have been most gladly and gratefully received he was as generous she doubted not as the most generous of his sex but while he was mortal there must be a triumph ,Pride and Prejudice
she began now to comprehend that he was exactly the man who in disposition and talents would most suit her his understanding and temper though unlike her own would have answered all her wishes it was an union that must have been to the advantage of both by her ease and liveliness his mind might have been softened his manners improved and from his judgement information and knowledge of the world she must have received benefit of greater importance ,Pride and Prejudice
but no such happy marriage could now teach the admiring multitude what connubial felicity really was an union of a different tendency and precluding the possibility of the other was soon to be formed in their family ,Pride and Prejudice
how wickham and lydia were to be supported in tolerable independence she could not imagine but how little of permanent happiness could belong to a couple who were only brought together because their passions were stronger than their virtue she could easily conjecture ,Pride and Prejudice
mr gardiner soon wrote again to his brother to mr bennets acknowledgments he briefly replied with assurance of his eagerness to promote the welfare of any of his family and concluded with entreaties that the subject might never be mentioned to him again the principal purport of his letter was to inform them that mr wickham had resolved on quitting the militia ,Pride and Prejudice
it was greatly my wish that he should do so he added as soon as his marriage was fixed on and i think you will agree with me in considering the removal from that corps as highly advisable both on his account and my nieces it is mr wickhams intention to go into the regulars and among his former friends there are still some who are able and willing to assist him in the army he has the promise of an ensigncy in general s regiment now quartered in the north it is an advantage to have it so far from this part of the kingdom he promises fairly and i hope among different people where they may each have a character to preserve they will both be more prudent i have written to colonel forster to inform him of our present arrangements and to request that he will satisfy the various creditors of mr wickham in and near brighton with assurances of speedy payment for which i have pledged myself and will you give yourself the trouble of carrying similar assurances to his creditors in meryton of whom i shall subjoin a list according to his information he has given in all his debts i hope at least he has not deceived us haggerston has our directions and all will be completed in a week they will then join his regiment unless they are first invited to longbourn and i understand from mrs gardiner that my niece is very desirous of seeing you all before she leaves the south she is well and begs to be dutifully remembered to you and her motheryours etc ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennet and his daughters saw all the advantages of wickhams removal from the shire as clearly as mr gardiner could do but mrs bennet was not so well pleased with it lydias being settled in the north just when she had expected most pleasure and pride in her company for she had by no means given up her plan of their residing in hertfordshire was a severe disappointment and besides it was such a pity that lydia should be taken from a regiment where she was acquainted with everybody and had so many favourites ,Pride and Prejudice
she is so fond of mrs forster said she it will be quite shocking to send her away and there are several of the young men too that she likes very much the officers may not be so pleasant in general s regiment ,Pride and Prejudice
his daughters request for such it might be considered of being admitted into her family again before she set off for the north received at first an absolute negative but jane and elizabeth who agreed in wishing for the sake of their sisters feelings and consequence that she should be noticed on her marriage by her parents urged him so earnestly yet so rationally and so mildly to receive her and her husband at longbourn as soon as they were married that he was prevailed on to think as they thought and act as they wished and their mother had the satisfaction of knowing that she would be able to show her married daughter in the neighbourhood before she was banished to the north when mr bennet wrote again to his brother therefore he sent his permission for them to come and it was settled that as soon as the ceremony was over they should proceed to longbourn elizabeth was surprised however that wickham should consent to such a scheme and had she consulted only her own inclination any meeting with him would have been the last object of her wishes ,Pride and Prejudice
their sisters wedding day arrived and jane and elizabeth felt for her probably more than she felt for herself the carriage was sent to meet them at  and they were to return in it by dinnertime their arrival was dreaded by the elder miss bennets and jane more especially who gave lydia the feelings which would have attended herself had she been the culprit and was wretched in the thought of what her sister must endure ,Pride and Prejudice
they came the family were assembled in the breakfast room to receive them smiles decked the face of mrs bennet as the carriage drove up to the door her husband looked impenetrably grave her daughters alarmed anxious uneasy ,Pride and Prejudice
lydias voice was heard in the vestibule the door was thrown open and she ran into the room her mother stepped forwards embraced her and welcomed her with rapture gave her hand with an affectionate smile to wickham who followed his lady and wished them both joy with an alacrity which shewed no doubt of their happiness ,Pride and Prejudice
their reception from mr bennet to whom they then turned was not quite so cordial his countenance rather gained in austerity and he scarcely opened his lips the easy assurance of the young couple indeed was enough to provoke him elizabeth was disgusted and even miss bennet was shocked lydia was lydia still untamed unabashed wild noisy and fearless she turned from sister to sister demanding their congratulations and when at length they all sat down looked eagerly round the room took notice of some little alteration in it and observed with a laugh that it was a great while since she had been there ,Pride and Prejudice
wickham was not at all more distressed than herself but his manners were always so pleasing that had his character and his marriage been exactly what they ought his smiles and his easy address while he claimed their relationship would have delighted them all elizabeth had not before believed him quite equal to such assurance but she sat down resolving within herself to draw no limits in future to the impudence of an impudent man she blushed and jane blushed but the cheeks of the two who caused their confusion suffered no variation of colour ,Pride and Prejudice
there was no want of discourse the bride and her mother could neither of them talk fast enough and wickham who happened to sit near elizabeth began enquiring after his acquaintance in that neighbourhood with a good humoured ease which she felt very unable to equal in her replies they seemed each of them to have the happiest memories in the world nothing of the past was recollected with pain and lydia led voluntarily to subjects which her sisters would not have alluded to for the world ,Pride and Prejudice
only think of its being three months she cried since i went away it seems but a fortnight i declare and yet there have been things enough happened in the time good gracious when i went away i am sure i had no more idea of being married till i came back again though i thought it would be very good fun if i was ,Pride and Prejudice
her father lifted up his eyes jane was distressed elizabeth looked expressively at lydia but she who never heard nor saw anything of which she chose to be insensible gaily continued oh mamma do the people hereabouts know i am married today i was afraid they might not and we overtook william goulding in his curricle so i was determined he should know it and so i let down the sideglass next to him and took off my glove and let my hand just rest upon the window frame so that he might see the ring and then i bowed and smiled like anything ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth could bear it no longer she got up and ran out of the room and returned no more till she heard them passing through the hall to the dining parlour she then joined them soon enough to see lydia with anxious parade walk up to her mothers right hand and hear her say to her eldest sister ah jane i take your place now and you must go lower because i am a married woman ,Pride and Prejudice
it was not to be supposed that time would give lydia that embarrassment from which she had been so wholly free at first her ease and good spirits increased she longed to see mrs phillips the lucases and all their other neighbours and to hear herself called mrs wickham by each of them and in the mean time she went after dinner to show her ring and boast of being married to mrs hill and the two housemaids ,Pride and Prejudice
well mamma said she when they were all returned to the breakfast room and what do you think of my husband is not he a charming man i am sure my sisters must all envy me i only hope they may have half my good luck they must all go to brighton that is the place to get husbands what a pity it is mamma we did not all go ,Pride and Prejudice
oh lord yesthere is nothing in that i shall like it of all things you and papa and my sisters must come down and see us we shall be at newcastle all the winter and i dare say there will be some balls and i will take care to get good partners for them all ,Pride and Prejudice
no one but mrs bennet regretted that their stay would be so short and she made the most of the time by visiting about with her daughter and having very frequent parties at home these parties were acceptable to all to avoid a family circle was even more desirable to such as did think than such as did not ,Pride and Prejudice
wickhams affection for lydia was just what elizabeth had expected to find it not equal to lydias for him she had scarcely needed her present observation to be satisfied from the reason of things that their elopement had been brought on by the strength of her love rather than by his and she would have wondered why without violently caring for her he chose to elope with her at all had she not felt certain that his flight was rendered necessary by distress of circumstances and if that were the case he was not the young man to resist an opportunity of having a companion ,Pride and Prejudice
lydia was exceedingly fond of him he was her dear wickham on every occasion no one was to be put in competition with him he did every thing best in the world and she was sure he would kill more birds on the first of september than any body else in the country ,Pride and Prejudice
la you are so strange but i must tell you how it went off we were married you know at st clements because wickhams lodgings were in that parish and it was settled that we should all be there by eleven oclock my uncle and aunt and i were to go together and the others were to meet us at the church well monday morning came and i was in such a fuss i was so afraid you know that something would happen to put it off and then i should have gone quite distracted and there was my aunt all the time i was dressing preaching and talking away just as if she was reading a sermon however i did not hear above one word in ten for i was thinking you may suppose of my dear wickham i longed to know whether he would be married in his blue coat ,Pride and Prejudice
well and so we breakfasted at ten as usual i thought it would never be over for by the bye you are to understand that my uncle and aunt were horrid unpleasant all the time i was with them if youll believe me i did not once put my foot out of doors though i was there a fortnight not one party or scheme or anything to be sure london was rather thin but however the little theatre was open well and so just as the carriage came to the door my uncle was called away upon business to that horrid man mr stone and then you know when once they get together there is no end of it well i was so frightened i did not know what to do for my uncle was to give me away and if we were beyond the hour we could not be married all day but luckily he came back again in ten minutes time and then we all set out however i recollected afterwards that if he had been prevented going the wedding need not be put off for mr darcy might have done as well ,Pride and Prejudice
oh yeshe was to come there with wickham you know but gracious me i quite forgot i ought not to have said a word about it i promised them so faithfully what will wickham say it was to be such a secret ,Pride and Prejudice
but to live in ignorance on such a point was impossible or at least it was impossible not to try for information mr darcy had been at her sisters wedding it was exactly a scene and exactly among people where he had apparently least to do and least temptation to go conjectures as to the meaning of it rapid and wild hurried into her brain but she was satisfied with none those that best pleased her as placing his conduct in the noblest light seemed most improbable she could not bear such suspense and hastily seizing a sheet of paper wrote a short letter to her aunt to request an explanation of what lydia had dropt if it were compatible with the secrecy which had been intended ,Pride and Prejudice
you may readily comprehend she added what my curiosity must be to know how a person unconnected with any of us and comparatively speaking a stranger to our family should have been amongst you at such a time pray write instantly and let me understand itunless it is for very cogent reasons to remain in the secrecy which lydia seems to think necessary and then i must endeavour to be satisfied with ignorance ,Pride and Prejudice
not that i shall though she added to herself as she finished the letter and my dear aunt if you do not tell me in an honourable manner i shall certainly be reduced to tricks and stratagems to find it out ,Pride and Prejudice
janes delicate sense of honour would not allow her to speak to elizabeth privately of what lydia had let fall elizabeth was glad of ittill it appeared whether her enquiries would receive any satisfaction she had rather be without a confidante ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth had the satisfaction of receiving an answer to her letter as soon as she possibly could she was no sooner in possession of it than hurrying into the little copse where she was least likely to be interrupted she sat down on one of the benches and prepared to be happy for the length of the letter convinced her that it did not contain a denial ,Pride and Prejudice
i have just received your letter and shall devote this whole morning to answering it as i foresee that a little writing will not comprise what i have to tell you i must confess myself surprised by your application i did not expect it from you dont think me angry however for i only mean to let you know that i had not imagined such enquiries to be necessary on your side if you do not choose to understand me forgive my impertinence your uncle is as much surprised as i amand nothing but the belief of your being a party concerned would have allowed him to act as he has done but if you are really innocent and ignorant i must be more explicit ,Pride and Prejudice
on the very day of my coming home from longbourn your uncle had a most unexpected visitor mr darcy called and was shut up with him several hours it was all over before i arrived so my curiosity was not so dreadfully racked as yours seems to have been he came to tell mr gardiner that he had found out where your sister and mr wickham were and that he had seen and talked with them both wickham repeatedly lydia once from what i can collect he left derbyshire only one day after ourselves and came to town with the resolution of hunting for them the motive professed was his conviction of its being owing to himself that wickhams worthlessness had not been so well known as to make it impossible for any young woman of character to love or confide in him he generously imputed the whole to his mistaken pride and confessed that he had before thought it beneath him to lay his private actions open to the world his character was to speak for itself he called it therefore his duty to step forward and endeavour to remedy an evil which had been brought on by himself if he had another motive i am sure it would never disgrace him he had been some days in town before he was able to discover them but he had something to direct his search which was more than we had and the consciousness of this was another reason for his resolving to follow us ,Pride and Prejudice
there is a lady it seems a mrs younge who was some time ago governess to miss darcy and was dismissed from her charge on some cause of disapprobation though he did not say what she then took a large house in edwardstreet and has since maintained herself by letting lodgings this mrs younge was he knew intimately acquainted with wickham and he went to her for intelligence of him as soon as he got to town but it was two or three days before he could get from her what he wanted she would not betray her trust i suppose without bribery and corruption for she really did know where her friend was to be found wickham indeed had gone to her on their first arrival in london and had she been able to receive them into her house they would have taken up their abode with her at length however our kind friend procured the wishedfor direction they were in  street he saw wickham and afterwards insisted on seeing lydia his first object with her he acknowledged had been to persuade her to quit her present disgraceful situation and return to her friends as soon as they could be prevailed on to receive her offering his assistance as far as it would go but he found lydia absolutely resolved on remaining where she was she cared for none of her friends she wanted no help of his she would not hear of leaving wickham she was sure they should be married some time or other and it did not much signify when since such were her feelings it only remained he thought to secure and expedite a marriage which in his very first conversation with wickham he easily learnt had never been his design he confessed himself obliged to leave the regiment on account of some debts of honour which were very pressing and scrupled not to lay all the illconsequences of lydias flight on her own folly alone he meant to resign his commission immediately and as to his future situation he could conjecture very little about it he must go somewhere but he did not know where and he knew he should have nothing to live on ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy asked him why he had not married your sister at once though mr bennet was not imagined to be very rich he would have been able to do something for him and his situation must have been benefited by marriage but he found in reply to this question that wickham still cherished the hope of more effectually making his fortune by marriage in some other country under such circumstances however he was not likely to be proof against the temptation of immediate relief ,Pride and Prejudice
everything being settled between them mr darcys next step was to make your uncle acquainted with it and he first called in gracechurch street the evening before i came home but mr gardiner could not be seen and mr darcy found on further enquiry that your father was still with him but would quit town the next morning he did not judge your father to be a person whom he could so properly consult as your uncle and therefore readily postponed seeing him till after the departure of the former he did not leave his name and till the next day it was only known that a gentleman had called on business ,Pride and Prejudice
they met again on sunday and then i saw him too it was not all settled before monday as soon as it was the express was sent off to longbourn but our visitor was very obstinate i fancy lizzy that obstinacy is the real defect of his character after all he has been accused of many faults at different times but this is the true one nothing was to be done that he did not do himself though i am sure and i do not speak it to be thanked therefore say nothing about it your uncle would most readily have settled the whole ,Pride and Prejudice
they battled it together for a long time which was more than either the gentleman or lady concerned in it deserved but at last your uncle was forced to yield and instead of being allowed to be of use to his niece was forced to put up with only having the probable credit of it which went sorely against the grain and i really believe your letter this morning gave him great pleasure because it required an explanation that would rob him of his borrowed feathers and give the praise where it was due but lizzy this must go no farther than yourself or jane at most ,Pride and Prejudice
you know pretty well i suppose what has been done for the young people his debts are to be paid amounting i believe to considerably more than a thousand pounds another thousand in addition to her own settled upon her and his commission purchased the reason why all this was to be done by him alone was such as i have given above it was owing to him to his reserve and want of proper consideration that wickhams character had been so misunderstood and consequently that he had been received and noticed as he was perhaps there was some truth in this though i doubt whether his reserve or anybodys reserve can be answerable for the event but in spite of all this fine talking my dear lizzy you may rest perfectly assured that your uncle would never have yielded if we had not given him credit for another interest in the affair ,Pride and Prejudice
when all this was resolved on he returned again to his friends who were still staying at pemberley but it was agreed that he should be in london once more when the wedding took place and all money matters were then to receive the last finish ,Pride and Prejudice
i believe i have now told you every thing it is a relation which you tell me is to give you great surprise i hope at least it will not afford you any displeasure lydia came to us and wickham had constant admission to the house he was exactly what he had been when i knew him in hertfordshire but i would not tell you how little i was satisfied with her behaviour while she staid with us if i had not perceived by janes letter last wednesday that her conduct on coming home was exactly of a piece with it and therefore what i now tell you can give you no fresh pain i talked to her repeatedly in the most serious manner representing to her all the wickedness of what she had done and all the unhappiness she had brought on her family if she heard me it was by good luck for i am sure she did not listen i was sometimes quite provoked but then i recollected my dear elizabeth and jane and for their sakes had patience with her ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy was punctual in his return and as lydia informed you attended the wedding he dined with us the next day and was to leave town again on wednesday or thursday will you be very angry with me my dear lizzy if i take this opportunity of saying what i was never bold enough to say before how much i like him his behaviour to us has in every respect been as pleasing as when we were in derbyshire his understanding and opinions all please me he wants nothing but a little more liveliness and that if he marry prudently his wife may teach him i thought him very slyhe hardly ever mentioned your name but slyness seems the fashion ,Pride and Prejudice
pray forgive me if i have been very presuming or at least do not punish me so far as to exclude me from p i shall never be quite happy till i have been all round the park a low phaeton with a nice little pair of ponies would be the very thing ,Pride and Prejudice
the contents of this letter threw elizabeth into a flutter of spirits in which it was difficult to determine whether pleasure or pain bore the greatest share the vague and unsettled suspicions which uncertainty had produced of what mr darcy might have been doing to forward her sisters match which she had feared to encourage as an exertion of goodness too great to be probable and at the same time dreaded to be just from the pain of obligation were proved beyond their greatest extent to be true he had followed them purposely to town he had taken on himself all the trouble and mortification attendant on such a research in which supplication had been necessary to a woman whom he must abominate and despise and where he was reduced to meet frequently meet reason with persuade and finally bribe the man whom he always most wished to avoid and whose very name it was punishment to him to pronounce he had done all this for a girl whom he could neither regard nor esteem her heart did whisper that he had done it for her but it was a hope shortly checked by other considerations and she soon felt that even her vanity was insufficient when required to depend on his affection for herfor a woman who had already refused himas able to overcome a sentiment so natural as abhorrence against relationship with wickham brotherinlaw of wickham every kind of pride must revolt from the connection he had to be sure done much she was ashamed to think how much but he had given a reason for his interference which asked no extraordinary stretch of belief it was reasonable that he should feel he had been wrong he had liberality and he had the means of exercising it and though she would not place herself as his principal inducement she could perhaps believe that remaining partiality for her might assist his endeavours in a cause where her peace of mind must be materially concerned it was painful exceedingly painful to know that they were under obligations to a person who could never receive a return they owed the restoration of lydia her character every thing to him oh how heartily did she grieve over every ungracious sensation she had ever encouraged every saucy speech she had ever directed towards him for herself she was humbled but she was proud of him proud that in a cause of compassion and honour he had been able to get the better of himself she read over her aunts commendation of him again and again it was hardly enough but it pleased her she was even sensible of some pleasure though mixed with regret on finding how steadfastly both she and her uncle had been persuaded that affection and confidence subsisted between mr darcy and herself ,Pride and Prejudice
i almost envy you the pleasure and yet i believe it would be too much for me or else i could take it in my way to newcastle and you saw the old housekeeper i suppose poor reynolds she was always very fond of me but of course she did not mention my name to you ,Pride and Prejudice
i have heard indeed that she is uncommonly improved within this year or two when i last saw her she was not very promising i am very glad you liked her i hope she will turn out well ,Pride and Prejudice
exceedingly well i should have considered it as part of my duty and the exertion would soon have been nothing one ought not to repinebut to be sure it would have been such a thing for me the quiet the retirement of such a life would have answered all my ideas of happiness but it was not to be did you ever hear darcy mention the circumstance when you were in kent ,Pride and Prejudice
i did hear too that there was a time when sermonmaking was not so palatable to you as it seems to be at present that you actually declared your resolution of never taking orders and that the business had been compromised accordingly ,Pride and Prejudice
mr wickham was so perfectly satisfied with this conversation that he never again distressed himself or provoked his dear sister elizabeth by introducing the subject of it and she was pleased to find that she had said enough to keep him quiet ,Pride and Prejudice
the day of his and lydias departure soon came and mrs bennet was forced to submit to a separation which as her husband by no means entered into her scheme of their all going to newcastle was likely to continue at least a twelvemonth ,Pride and Prejudice
he is as fine a fellow said mr bennet as soon as they were out of the house as ever i saw he simpers and smirks and makes love to us all i am prodigiously proud of him i defy even sir william lucas himself to produce a more valuable soninlaw ,Pride and Prejudice
it is no such thing lydia does not leave me because she is married but only because her husbands regiment happens to be so far off if that had been nearer she would not have gone so soon ,Pride and Prejudice
but the spiritless condition which this event threw her into was shortly relieved and her mind opened again to the agitation of hope by an article of news which then began to be in circulation the housekeeper at netherfield had received orders to prepare for the arrival of her master who was coming down in a day or two to shoot there for several weeks mrs bennet was quite in the fidgets she looked at jane and smiled and shook her head by turns ,Pride and Prejudice
well well and so mr bingley is coming down sister for mrs phillips first brought her the news well so much the better not that i care about it though he is nothing to us you know and i am sure i never want to see him again but however he is very welcome to come to netherfield if he likes it and who knows what may happen but that is nothing to us you know sister we agreed long ago never to mention a word about it and so is it quite certain he is coming ,Pride and Prejudice
you may depend on it replied the other for mrs nicholls was in meryton last night i saw her passing by and went out myself on purpose to know the truth of it and she told me that it was certain true he comes down on thursday at the latest very likely on wednesday she was going to the butchers she told me on purpose to order in some meat on wednesday and she has got three couple of ducks just fit to be killed ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bennet had not been able to hear of his coming without changing colour it was many months since she had mentioned his name to elizabeth but now as soon as they were alone together she said ,Pride and Prejudice
i saw you look at me today lizzy when my aunt told us of the present report and i know i appeared distressed but dont imagine it was from any silly cause i was only confused for the moment because i felt that i should be looked at i do assure you that the news does not affect me either with pleasure or pain i am glad of one thing that he comes alone because we shall see the less of him not that i am afraid of myself but i dread other peoples remarks ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth did not know what to make of it had she not seen him in derbyshire she might have supposed him capable of coming there with no other view than what was acknowledged but she still thought him partial to jane and she wavered as to the greater probability of his coming there with his friends permission or being bold enough to come without it ,Pride and Prejudice
in spite of what her sister declared and really believed to be her feelings in the expectation of his arrival elizabeth could easily perceive that her spirits were affected by it they were more disturbed more unequal than she had often seen them ,Pride and Prejudice
no no you forced me into visiting him last year and promised if i went to see him he should marry one of my daughters but it ended in nothing and i will not be sent on a fools errand again ,Pride and Prejudice
tis an etiquette i despise said he if he wants our society let him seek it he knows where we live i will not spend my hours in running after my neighbours every time they go away and come back again ,Pride and Prejudice
well all i know is that it will be abominably rude if you do not wait on him but however that shant prevent my asking him to dine here i am determined we must have mrs long and the gouldings soon that will make thirteen with ourselves so there will be just room at table for him ,Pride and Prejudice
consoled by this resolution she was the better able to bear her husbands incivility though it was very mortifying to know that her neighbours might all see mr bingley in consequence of it before they did as the day of his arrival drew near ,Pride and Prejudice
i begin to be sorry that he comes at all said jane to her sister it would be nothing i could see him with perfect indifference but i can hardly bear to hear it thus perpetually talked of my mother means well but she does not know no one can know how much i suffer from what she says happy shall i be when his stay at netherfield is over ,Pride and Prejudice
i wish i could say anything to comfort you replied elizabeth but it is wholly out of my power you must feel it and the usual satisfaction of preaching patience to a sufferer is denied me because you have always so much ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bingley arrived mrs bennet through the assistance of servants contrived to have the earliest tidings of it that the period of anxiety and fretfulness on her side might be as long as it could she counted the days that must intervene before their invitation could be sent hopeless of seeing him before but on the third morning after his arrival in hertfordshire she saw him from her dressingroom window enter the paddock and ride towards the house ,Pride and Prejudice
her daughters were eagerly called to partake of her joy jane resolutely kept her place at the table but elizabeth to satisfy her mother went to the windowshe lookedshe saw mr darcy with him and sat down again by her sister ,Pride and Prejudice
jane looked at elizabeth with surprise and concern she knew but little of their meeting in derbyshire and therefore felt for the awkwardness which must attend her sister in seeing him almost for the first time after receiving his explanatory letter both sisters were uncomfortable enough each felt for the other and of course for themselves and their mother talked on of her dislike of mr darcy and her resolution to be civil to him only as mr bingleys friend without being heard by either of them but elizabeth had sources of uneasiness which could not be suspected by jane to whom she had never yet had courage to shew mrs gardiners letter or to relate her own change of sentiment towards him to jane he could be only a man whose proposals she had refused and whose merit she had undervalued but to her own more extensive information he was the person to whom the whole family were indebted for the first of benefits and whom she regarded herself with an interest if not quite so tender at least as reasonable and just as what jane felt for bingley her astonishment at his comingat his coming to netherfield to longbourn and voluntarily seeking her again was almost equal to what she had known on first witnessing his altered behaviour in derbyshire ,Pride and Prejudice
the colour which had been driven from her face returned for half a minute with an additional glow and a smile of delight added lustre to her eyes as she thought for that space of time that his affection and wishes must still be unshaken but she would not be secure ,Pride and Prejudice
she sat intently at work striving to be composed and without daring to lift up her eyes till anxious curiosity carried them to the face of her sister as the servant was approaching the door jane looked a little paler than usual but more sedate than elizabeth had expected on the gentlemens appearing her colour increased yet she received them with tolerable ease and with a propriety of behaviour equally free from any symptom of resentment or any unnecessary complaisance ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth said as little to either as civility would allow and sat down again to her work with an eagerness which it did not often command she had ventured only one glance at darcy he looked serious as usual and she thought more as he had been used to look in hertfordshire than as she had seen him at pemberley but perhaps he could not in her mothers presence be what he was before her uncle and aunt it was a painful but not an improbable conjecture ,Pride and Prejudice
bingley she had likewise seen for an instant and in that short period saw him looking both pleased and embarrassed he was received by mrs bennet with a degree of civility which made her two daughters ashamed especially when contrasted with the cold and ceremonious politeness of her curtsey and address to his friend ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth particularly who knew that her mother owed to the latter the preservation of her favourite daughter from irremediable infamy was hurt and distressed to a most painful degree by a distinction so ill applied ,Pride and Prejudice
darcy after enquiring of her how mr and mrs gardiner did a question which she could not answer without confusion said scarcely anything he was not seated by her perhaps that was the reason of his silence but it had not been so in derbyshire there he had talked to her friends when he could not to herself but now several minutes elapsed without bringing the sound of his voice and when occasionally unable to resist the impulse of curiosity she raised her eyes to his face she as often found him looking at jane as at herself and frequently on no object but the ground more thoughtfulness and less anxiety to please than when they last met were plainly expressed she was disappointed and angry with herself for being so ,Pride and Prejudice
i began to be afraid you would never come back again people did say you meant to quit the place entirely at michaelmas but however i hope it is not true a great many changes have happened in the neighbourhood since you went away miss lucas is married and settled and one of my own daughters i suppose you have heard of it indeed you must have seen it in the papers it was in the times and the courier i know though it was not put in as it ought to be it was only said lately george wickham esq to miss lydia bennet without there being a syllable said of her father or the place where she lived or anything it was my brother gardiners drawing up too and i wonder how he came to make such an awkward business of it did you see it ,Pride and Prejudice
it is a delightful thing to be sure to have a daughter well married continued her mother but at the same time mr bingley it is very hard to have her taken such a way from me they are gone down to newcastle a place quite northward it seems and there they are to stay i do not know how long his regiment is there for i suppose you have heard of his leaving the shire and of his being gone into the regulars thank heaven he has some friends though perhaps not so many as he deserves ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth who knew this to be levelled at mr darcy was in such misery of shame that she could hardly keep her seat it drew from her however the exertion of speaking which nothing else had so effectually done before and she asked bingley whether he meant to make any stay in the country at present a few weeks he believed ,Pride and Prejudice
when you have killed all your own birds mr bingley said her mother i beg you will come here and shoot as many as you please on mr bennets manor i am sure he will be vastly happy to oblige you and will save all the best of the covies for you ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths misery increased at such unnecessary such officious attention were the same fair prospect to arise at present as had flattered them a year ago every thing she was persuaded would be hastening to the same vexatious conclusion at that instant she felt that years of happiness could not make jane or herself amends for moments of such painful confusion ,Pride and Prejudice
the first wish of my heart said she to herself is never more to be in company with either of them their society can afford no pleasure that will atone for such wretchedness as this let me never see either one or the other again ,Pride and Prejudice
yet the misery for which years of happiness were to offer no compensation received soon afterwards material relief from observing how much the beauty of her sister rekindled the admiration of her former lover when first he came in he had spoken to her but little but every five minutes seemed to be giving her more of his attention he found her as handsome as she had been last year as good natured and as unaffected though not quite so chatty jane was anxious that no difference should be perceived in her at all and was really persuaded that she talked as much as ever but her mind was so busily engaged that she did not always know when she was silent ,Pride and Prejudice
you are quite a visit in my debt mr bingley she added for when you went to town last winter you promised to take a family dinner with us as soon as you returned i have not forgot you see and i assure you i was very much disappointed that you did not come back and keep your engagement ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet had been strongly inclined to ask them to stay and dine there that day but though she always kept a very good table she did not think anything less than two courses could be good enough for a man on whom she had such anxious designs or satisfy the appetite and pride of one who had ten thousand a year ,Pride and Prejudice
as soon as they were gone elizabeth walked out to recover her spirits or in other words to dwell without interruption on those subjects that must deaden them more mr darcys behaviour astonished and vexed her ,Pride and Prejudice
he could be still amiable still pleasing to my uncle and aunt when he was in town and why not to me if he fears me why come hither if he no longer cares for me why silent teasing teasing man i will think no more about him ,Pride and Prejudice
her resolution was for a short time involuntarily kept by the approach of her sister who joined her with a cheerful look which showed her better satisfied with their visitors than elizabeth ,Pride and Prejudice
now said she that this first meeting is over i feel perfectly easy i know my own strength and i shall never be embarrassed again by his coming i am glad he dines here on tuesday it will then be publicly seen that on both sides we meet only as common and indifferent acquaintance ,Pride and Prejudice
they did not see the gentlemen again till tuesday and mrs bennet in the meanwhile was giving way to all the happy schemes which the good humour and common politeness of bingley in half an hours visit had revived ,Pride and Prejudice
on tuesday there was a large party assembled at longbourn and the two who were most anxiously expected to the credit of their punctuality as sportsmen were in very good time when they repaired to the diningroom elizabeth eagerly watched to see whether bingley would take the place which in all their former parties had belonged to him by her sister her prudent mother occupied by the same ideas forbore to invite him to sit by herself on entering the room he seemed to hesitate but jane happened to look round and happened to smile it was decided he placed himself by her ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth with a triumphant sensation looked towards his friend he bore it with noble indifference and she would have imagined that bingley had received his sanction to be happy had she not seen his eyes likewise turned towards mr darcy with an expression of halflaughing alarm ,Pride and Prejudice
his behaviour to her sister was such during dinner time as showed an admiration of her which though more guarded than formerly persuaded elizabeth that if left wholly to himself janes happiness and his own would be speedily secured though she dared not depend upon the consequence she yet received pleasure from observing his behaviour it gave her all the animation that her spirits could boast for she was in no cheerful humour mr darcy was almost as far from her as the table could divide them he was on one side of her mother she knew how little such a situation would give pleasure to either or make either appear to advantage she was not near enough to hear any of their discourse but she could see how seldom they spoke to each other and how formal and cold was their manner whenever they did her mothers ungraciousness made the sense of what they owed him more painful to elizabeths mind and she would at times have given anything to be privileged to tell him that his kindness was neither unknown nor unfelt by the whole of the family ,Pride and Prejudice
she was in hopes that the evening would afford some opportunity of bringing them together that the whole of the visit would not pass away without enabling them to enter into something more of conversation than the mere ceremonious salutation attending his entrance anxious and uneasy the period which passed in the drawingroom before the gentlemen came was wearisome and dull to a degree that almost made her uncivil she looked forward to their entrance as the point on which all her chance of pleasure for the evening must depend ,Pride and Prejudice
the gentlemen came and she thought he looked as if he would have answered her hopes but alas the ladies had crowded round the table where miss bennet was making tea and elizabeth pouring out the coffee in so close a confederacy that there was not a single vacancy near her which would admit of a chair and on the gentlemens approaching one of the girls moved closer to her than ever and said in a whisper ,Pride and Prejudice
darcy had walked away to another part of the room she followed him with her eyes envied everyone to whom he spoke had scarcely patience enough to help anybody to coffee and then was enraged against herself for being so silly ,Pride and Prejudice
a man who has once been refused how could i ever be foolish enough to expect a renewal of his love is there one among the sex who would not protest against such a weakness as a second proposal to the same woman there is no indignity so abhorrent to their feelings ,Pride and Prejudice
she could think of nothing more to say but if he wished to converse with her he might have better success he stood by her however for some minutes in silence and at last on the young ladys whispering to elizabeth again he walked away ,Pride and Prejudice
when the teathings were removed and the cardtables placed the ladies all rose and elizabeth was then hoping to be soon joined by him when all her views were overthrown by seeing him fall a victim to her mothers rapacity for whist players and in a few moments after seated with the rest of the party she now lost every expectation of pleasure they were confined for the evening at different tables and she had nothing to hope but that his eyes were so often turned towards her side of the room as to make him play as unsuccessfully as herself ,Pride and Prejudice
well girls said she as soon as they were left to themselves what say you to the day i think every thing has passed off uncommonly well i assure you the dinner was as well dressed as any i ever saw the venison was roasted to a turnand everybody said they never saw so fat a haunch the soup was fifty times better than what we had at the lucases last week and even mr darcy acknowledged that the partridges were remarkably well done and i suppose he has two or three french cooks at least and my dear jane i never saw you look in greater beauty mrs long said so too for i asked her whether you did not and what do you think she said besides ah mrs bennet we shall have her at netherfield at last she did indeed i do think mrs long is as good a creature as ever livedand her nieces are very pretty behaved girls and not at all handsome i like them prodigiously ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet in short was in very great spirits she had seen enough of bingleys behaviour to jane to be convinced that she would get him at last and her expectations of advantage to her family when in a happy humour were so far beyond reason that she was quite disappointed at not seeing him there again the next day to make his proposals ,Pride and Prejudice
lizzy you must not do so you must not suspect me it mortifies me i assure you that i have now learnt to enjoy his conversation as an agreeable and sensible young man without having a wish beyond it i am perfectly satisfied from what his manners now are that he never had any design of engaging my affection it is only that he is blessed with greater sweetness of address and a stronger desire of generally pleasing than any other man ,Pride and Prejudice
that is a question which i hardly know how to answer we all love to instruct though we can teach only what is not worth knowing forgive me and if you persist in indifference do not make me your confidante ,Pride and Prejudice
a few days after this visit mr bingley called again and alone his friend had left him that morning for london but was to return home in ten days time he sat with them above an hour and was in remarkably good spirits mrs bennet invited him to dine with them but with many expressions of concern he confessed himself engaged elsewhere ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear jane make haste and hurry down he is comemr bingley is come he is indeed make haste make haste here sarah come to miss bennet this moment and help her on with her gown never mind miss lizzys hair ,Pride and Prejudice
the same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening after tea mr bennet retired to the library as was his custom and mary went up stairs to her instrument two obstacles of the five being thus removed mrs bennet sat looking and winking at elizabeth and catherine for a considerable time without making any impression on them elizabeth would not observe her and when at last kitty did she very innocently said what is the matter mamma what do you keep winking at me for what am i to do ,Pride and Prejudice
nothing child nothing i did not wink at you she then sat still five minutes longer but unable to waste such a precious occasion she suddenly got up and saying to kitty come here my love i want to speak to you took her out of the room jane instantly gave a look at elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation and her entreaty that she would not give in to it in a few minutes mrs bennet halfopened the door and called out ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennets schemes for this day were ineffectual bingley was every thing that was charming except the professed lover of her daughter his ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party and he bore with the illjudged officiousness of the mother and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter ,Pride and Prejudice
he scarcely needed an invitation to stay supper and before he went away an engagement was formed chiefly through his own and mrs bennets means for his coming next morning to shoot with her husband ,Pride and Prejudice
after this day jane said no more of her indifference not a word passed between the sisters concerning bingley but elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded unless mr darcy returned within the stated time seriously however she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentlemans concurrence ,Pride and Prejudice
bingley was punctual to his appointment and he and mr bennet spent the morning together as had been agreed on the latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected there was nothing of presumption or folly in bingley that could provoke his ridicule or disgust him into silence and he was more communicative and less eccentric than the other had ever seen him bingley of course returned with him to dinner and in the evening mrs bennets invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter elizabeth who had a letter to write went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea for as the others were all going to sit down to cards she could not be wanted to counteract her mothers schemes ,Pride and Prejudice
but on returning to the drawingroom when her letter was finished she saw to her infinite surprise there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her on opening the door she perceived her sister and bingley standing together over the hearth as if engaged in earnest conversation and had this led to no suspicion the faces of both as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other would have told it all their situation was awkward enough but hers she thought was still worse not a syllable was uttered by either and elizabeth was on the point of going away again when bingley who as well as the other had sat down suddenly rose and whispering a few words to her sister ran out of the room ,Pride and Prejudice
jane could have no reserves from elizabeth where confidence would give pleasure and instantly embracing her acknowledged with the liveliest emotion that she was the happiest creature in the world ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths congratulations were given with a sincerity a warmth a delight which words could but poorly express every sentence of kindness was a fresh source of happiness to jane but she would not allow herself to stay with her sister or say half that remained to be said for the present ,Pride and Prejudice
i must go instantly to my mother she cried i would not on any account trifle with her affectionate solicitude or allow her to hear it from anyone but myself he is gone to my father already oh lizzy to know that what i have to relate will give such pleasure to all my dear family how shall i bear so much happiness ,Pride and Prejudice
he then shut the door and coming up to her claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship they shook hands with great cordiality and then till her sister came down she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness and of janes perfections and in spite of his being a lover elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded because they had for basis the excellent understanding and superexcellent disposition of jane and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself ,Pride and Prejudice
it was an evening of no common delight to them all the satisfaction of miss bennets mind gave a glow of such sweet animation to her face as made her look handsomer than ever kitty simpered and smiled and hoped her turn was coming soon mrs bennet could not give her consent or speak her approbation in terms warm enough to satisfy her feelings though she talked to bingley of nothing else for half an hour and when mr bennet joined them at supper his voice and manner plainly showed how really happy he was ,Pride and Prejudice
you are a good girl he replied and i have great pleasure in thinking you will be so happily settled i have not a doubt of your doing very well together your tempers are by no means unlike you are each of you so complying that nothing will ever be resolved on so easy that every servant will cheat you and so generous that you will always exceed your income ,Pride and Prejudice
exceed their income my dear mr bennet cried his wife what are you talking of why he has four or five thousand a year and very likely more then addressing her daughter oh my dear dear jane i am so happy i am sure i shant get a wink of sleep all night i knew how it would be i always said it must be so at last i was sure you could not be so beautiful for nothing i remember as soon as ever i saw him when he first came into hertfordshire last year i thought how likely it was that you should come together oh he is the handsomest young man that ever was seen ,Pride and Prejudice
wickham lydia were all forgotten jane was beyond competition her favourite child at that moment she cared for no other her younger sisters soon began to make interest with her for objects of happiness which she might in future be able to dispense ,Pride and Prejudice
bingley from this time was of course a daily visitor at longbourn coming frequently before breakfast and always remaining till after supper unless when some barbarous neighbour who could not be enough detested had given him an invitation to dinner which he thought himself obliged to accept ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth had now but little time for conversation with her sister for while he was present jane had no attention to bestow on anyone else but she found herself considerably useful to both of them in those hours of separation that must sometimes occur in the absence of jane he always attached himself to elizabeth for the pleasure of talking of her and when bingley was gone jane constantly sought the same means of relief ,Pride and Prejudice
it must have been his sisters doing they were certainly no friends to his acquaintance with me which i cannot wonder at since he might have chosen so much more advantageously in many respects but when they see as i trust they will that their brother is happy with me they will learn to be contented and we shall be on good terms again though we can never be what we once were to each other ,Pride and Prejudice
would you believe it lizzy that when he went to town last november he really loved me and nothing but a persuasion of my being indifferent would have prevented his coming down again ,Pride and Prejudice
this naturally introduced a panegyric from jane on his diffidence and the little value he put on his own good qualities elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend for though jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him ,Pride and Prejudice
i am certainly the most fortunate creature that ever existed cried jane oh lizzy why am i thus singled from my family and blessed above them all if i could but see you as happy if there were but such another man for you ,Pride and Prejudice
if you were to give me forty such men i never could be so happy as you till i have your disposition your goodness i never can have your happiness no no let me shift for myself and perhaps if i have very good luck i may meet with another mr collins in time ,Pride and Prejudice
the situation of affairs in the longbourn family could not be long a secret mrs bennet was privileged to whisper it to mrs phillips and she ventured without any permission to do the same by all her neighbours in meryton ,Pride and Prejudice
the bennets were speedily pronounced to be the luckiest family in the world though only a few weeks before when lydia had first run away they had been generally proved to be marked out for misfortune ,Pride and Prejudice
one morning about a week after bingleys engagement with jane had been formed as he and the females of the family were sitting together in the diningroom their attention was suddenly drawn to the window by the sound of a carriage and they perceived a chaise and four driving up the lawn it was too early in the morning for visitors and besides the equipage did not answer to that of any of their neighbours the horses were post and neither the carriage nor the livery of the servant who preceded it were familiar to them as it was certain however that somebody was coming bingley instantly prevailed on miss bennet to avoid the confinement of such an intrusion and walk away with him into the shrubbery they both set off and the conjectures of the remaining three continued though with little satisfaction till the door was thrown open and their visitor entered it was lady catherine de bourgh ,Pride and Prejudice
they were of course all intending to be surprised but their astonishment was beyond their expectation and on the part of mrs bennet and kitty though she was perfectly unknown to them even inferior to what elizabeth felt ,Pride and Prejudice
she entered the room with an air more than usually ungracious made no other reply to elizabeths salutation than a slight inclination of the head and sat down without saying a word elizabeth had mentioned her name to her mother on her ladyships entrance though no request of introduction had been made ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet all amazement though flattered by having a guest of such high importance received her with the utmost politeness after sitting for a moment in silence she said very stiffly to elizabeth ,Pride and Prejudice
yes madam said mrs bennet delighted to speak to lady catherine she is my youngest girl but one my youngest of all is lately married and my eldest is somewhere about the grounds walking with a young man who i believe will soon become a part of the family ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs bennet with great civility begged her ladyship to take some refreshment but lady catherine very resolutely and not very politely declined eating anything and then rising up said to elizabeth ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth obeyed and running into her own room for her parasol attended her noble guest downstairs as they passed through the hall lady catherine opened the doors into the diningparlour and drawingroom and pronouncing them after a short survey to be decent looking rooms walked on ,Pride and Prejudice
her carriage remained at the door and elizabeth saw that her waitingwoman was in it they proceeded in silence along the gravel walk that led to the copse elizabeth was determined to make no effort for conversation with a woman who was now more than usually insolent and disagreeable ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bennet replied her ladyship in an angry tone you ought to know that i am not to be trifled with but however insincere you may choose to be you shall not find me so my character has ever been celebrated for its sincerity and frankness and in a cause of such moment as this i shall certainly not depart from it a report of a most alarming nature reached me two days ago i was told that not only your sister was on the point of being most advantageously married but that you that miss elizabeth bennet would in all likelihood be soon afterwards united to my nephew my own nephew mr darcy though i know it must be a scandalous falsehood though i would not injure him so much as to suppose the truth of it possible i instantly resolved on setting off for this place that i might make my sentiments known to you ,Pride and Prejudice
if you believed it impossible to be true said elizabeth colouring with astonishment and disdain i wonder you took the trouble of coming so far what could your ladyship propose by it ,Pride and Prejudice
it ought to be so it must be so while he retains the use of his reason but your arts and allurements may in a moment of infatuation have made him forget what he owes to himself and to all his family you may have drawn him in ,Pride and Prejudice
the engagement between them is of a peculiar kind from their infancy they have been intended for each other it was the favourite wish of his mother as well as of hers while in their cradles we planned the union and now at the moment when the wishes of both sisters would be accomplished in their marriage to be prevented by a young woman of inferior birth of no importance in the world and wholly unallied to the family do you pay no regard to the wishes of his friends to his tacit engagement with miss de bourgh are you lost to every feeling of propriety and delicacy have you not heard me say that from his earliest hours he was destined for his cousin ,Pride and Prejudice
yes and i had heard it before but what is that to me if there is no other objection to my marrying your nephew i shall certainly not be kept from it by knowing that his mother and aunt wished him to marry miss de bourgh you both did as much as you could in planning the marriage its completion depended on others if mr darcy is neither by honour nor inclination confined to his cousin why is not he to make another choice and if i am that choice why may not i accept him ,Pride and Prejudice
because honour decorum prudence nay interest forbid it yes miss bennet interest for do not expect to be noticed by his family or friends if you wilfully act against the inclinations of all you will be censured slighted and despised by everyone connected with him your alliance will be a disgrace your name will never even be mentioned by any of us ,Pride and Prejudice
these are heavy misfortunes replied elizabeth but the wife of mr darcy must have such extraordinary sources of happiness necessarily attached to her situation that she could upon the whole have no cause to repine ,Pride and Prejudice
obstinate headstrong girl i am ashamed of you is this your gratitude for my attentions to you last spring is nothing due to me on that score let us sit down you are to understand miss bennet that i came here with the determined resolution of carrying my purpose nor will i be dissuaded from it i have not been used to submit to any persons whims i have not been in the habit of brooking disappointment ,Pride and Prejudice
i will not be interrupted hear me in silence my daughter and my nephew are formed for each other they are descended on the maternal side from the same noble line and on the fathers from respectable honourable and ancientthough untitledfamilies their fortune on both sides is splendid they are destined for each other by the voice of every member of their respective houses and what is to divide them the upstart pretensions of a young woman without family connections or fortune is this to be endured but it must not shall not be if you were sensible of your own good you would not wish to quit the sphere in which you have been brought up ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bennet i am shocked and astonished i expected to find a more reasonable young woman but do not deceive yourself into a belief that i will ever recede i shall not go away till you have given me the assurance i require ,Pride and Prejudice
and i certainly never shall give it i am not to be intimidated into anything so wholly unreasonable your ladyship wants mr darcy to marry your daughter but would my giving you the wishedfor promise make their marriage at all more probable supposing him to be attached to me would my refusing to accept his hand make him wish to bestow it on his cousin allow me to say lady catherine that the arguments with which you have supported this extraordinary application have been as frivolous as the application was illjudged you have widely mistaken my character if you think i can be worked on by such persuasions as these how far your nephew might approve of your interference in his affairs i cannot tell but you have certainly no right to concern yourself in mine i must beg therefore to be importuned no farther on the subject ,Pride and Prejudice
not so hasty if you please i have by no means done to all the objections i have already urged i have still another to add i am no stranger to the particulars of your youngest sisters infamous elopement i know it all that the young mans marrying her was a patchedup business at the expence of your father and uncles and is such a girl to be my nephews sister is her husband who is the son of his late fathers steward to be his brother heaven and earthof what are you thinking are the shades of pemberley to be thus polluted ,Pride and Prejudice
i have said no such thing i am only resolved to act in that manner which will in my own opinion constitute my happiness without reference to you or to any person so wholly unconnected with me ,Pride and Prejudice
it is well you refuse then to oblige me you refuse to obey the claims of duty honour and gratitude you are determined to ruin him in the opinion of all his friends and make him the contempt of the world ,Pride and Prejudice
neither duty nor honour nor gratitude replied elizabeth have any possible claim on me in the present instance no principle of either would be violated by my marriage with mr darcy and with regard to the resentment of his family or the indignation of the world if the former were excited by his marrying me it would not give me one moments concernand the world in general would have too much sense to join in the scorn ,Pride and Prejudice
and this is your real opinion this is your final resolve very well i shall now know how to act do not imagine miss bennet that your ambition will ever be gratified i came to try you i hoped to find you reasonable but depend upon it i will carry my point ,Pride and Prejudice
in this manner lady catherine talked on till they were at the door of the carriage when turning hastily round she added i take no leave of you miss bennet i send no compliments to your mother you deserve no such attention i am most seriously displeased ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth made no answer and without attempting to persuade her ladyship to return into the house walked quietly into it herself she heard the carriage drive away as she proceeded up stairs her mother impatiently met her at the door of the dressingroom to ask why lady catherine would not come in again and rest herself ,Pride and Prejudice
she is a very finelooking woman and her calling here was prodigiously civil for she only came i suppose to tell us the collinses were well she is on her road somewhere i dare say and so passing through meryton thought she might as well call on you i suppose she had nothing particular to say to you lizzy ,Pride and Prejudice
the discomposure of spirits which this extraordinary visit threw elizabeth into could not be easily overcome nor could she for many hours learn to think of it less than incessantly lady catherine it appeared had actually taken the trouble of this journey from rosings for the sole purpose of breaking off her supposed engagement with mr darcy it was a rational scheme to be sure but from what the report of their engagement could originate elizabeth was at a loss to imagine till she recollected that his being the intimate friend of bingley and her being the sister of jane was enough at a time when the expectation of one wedding made everybody eager for another to supply the idea she had not herself forgotten to feel that the marriage of her sister must bring them more frequently together and her neighbours at lucas lodge therefore for through their communication with the collinses the report she concluded had reached lady catherine had only set that down as almost certain and immediate which she had looked forward to as possible at some future time ,Pride and Prejudice
in revolving lady catherines expressions however she could not help feeling some uneasiness as to the possible consequence of her persisting in this interference from what she had said of her resolution to prevent their marriage it occurred to elizabeth that she must meditate an application to her nephew and how he might take a similar representation of the evils attached to a connection with her she dared not pronounce she knew not the exact degree of his affection for his aunt or his dependence on her judgment but it was natural to suppose that he thought much higher of her ladyship than she could do and it was certain that in enumerating the miseries of a marriage with one whose immediate connections were so unequal to his own his aunt would address him on his weakest side with his notions of dignity he would probably feel that the arguments which to elizabeth had appeared weak and ridiculous contained much good sense and solid reasoning ,Pride and Prejudice
if he had been wavering before as to what he should do which had often seemed likely the advice and entreaty of so near a relation might settle every doubt and determine him at once to be as happy as dignity unblemished could make him in that case he would return no more lady catherine might see him in her way through town and his engagement to bingley of coming again to netherfield must give way ,Pride and Prejudice
if therefore an excuse for not keeping his promise should come to his friend within a few days she added i shall know how to understand it i shall then give over every expectation every wish of his constancy if he is satisfied with only regretting me when he might have obtained my affections and hand i shall soon cease to regret him at all ,Pride and Prejudice
the surprise of the rest of the family on hearing who their visitor had been was very great but they obligingly satisfied it with the same kind of supposition which had appeased mrs bennets curiosity and elizabeth was spared from much teasing on the subject ,Pride and Prejudice
she followed him thither and her curiosity to know what he had to tell her was heightened by the supposition of its being in some manner connected with the letter he held it suddenly struck her that it might be from lady catherine and she anticipated with dismay all the consequent explanations ,Pride and Prejudice
i have received a letter this morning that has astonished me exceedingly as it principally concerns yourself you ought to know its contents i did not know before that i had two daughters on the brink of matrimony let me congratulate you on a very important conquest ,Pride and Prejudice
the colour now rushed into elizabeths cheeks in the instantaneous conviction of its being a letter from the nephew instead of the aunt and she was undetermined whether most to be pleased that he explained himself at all or offended that his letter was not rather addressed to herself when her father continued ,Pride and Prejudice
you look conscious young ladies have great penetration in such matters as these but i think i may defy even your sagacity to discover the name of your admirer this letter is from mr collins ,Pride and Prejudice
something very much to the purpose of course he begins with congratulations on the approaching nuptials of my eldest daughter of which it seems he has been told by some of the goodnatured gossiping lucases i shall not sport with your impatience by reading what he says on that point what relates to yourself is as follows having thus offered you the sincere congratulations of mrs collins and myself on this happy event let me now add a short hint on the subject of another of which we have been advertised by the same authority your daughter elizabeth it is presumed will not long bear the name of bennet after her elder sister has resigned it and the chosen partner of her fate may be reasonably looked up to as one of the most illustrious personages in this land ,Pride and Prejudice
can you possibly guess lizzy who is meant by this this young gentleman is blessed in a peculiar way with every thing the heart of mortal can most desiresplendid property noble kindred and extensive patronage yet in spite of all these temptations let me warn my cousin elizabeth and yourself of what evils you may incur by a precipitate closure with this gentlemans proposals which of course you will be inclined to take immediate advantage of ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy you see is the man now lizzy i think i have surprised you could he or the lucases have pitched on any man within the circle of our acquaintance whose name would have given the lie more effectually to what they related mr darcy who never looks at any woman but to see a blemish and who probably never looked at you in his life it is admirable ,Pride and Prejudice
after mentioning the likelihood of this marriage to her ladyship last night she immediately with her usual condescension expressed what she felt on the occasion when it became apparent that on the score of some family objections on the part of my cousin she would never give her consent to what she termed so disgraceful a match i thought it my duty to give the speediest intelligence of this to my cousin that she and her noble admirer may be aware of what they are about and not run hastily into a marriage which has not been properly sanctioned mr collins moreover adds i am truly rejoiced that my cousin lydias sad business has been so well hushed up and am only concerned that their living together before the marriage took place should be so generally known i must not however neglect the duties of my station or refrain from declaring my amazement at hearing that you received the young couple into your house as soon as they were married it was an encouragement of vice and had i been the rector of longbourn i should very strenuously have opposed it you ought certainly to forgive them as a christian but never to admit them in your sight or allow their names to be mentioned in your hearing that is his notion of christian forgiveness the rest of his letter is only about his dear charlottes situation and his expectation of a young olivebranch but lizzy you look as if you did not enjoy it you are not going to be missish i hope and pretend to be affronted at an idle report for what do we live but to make sport for our neighbours and laugh at them in our turn ,Pride and Prejudice
yesthat is what makes it amusing had they fixed on any other man it would have been nothing but his perfect indifference and your pointed dislike make it so delightfully absurd much as i abominate writing i would not give up mr collinss correspondence for any consideration nay when i read a letter of his i cannot help giving him the preference even over wickham much as i value the impudence and hypocrisy of my soninlaw and pray lizzy what said lady catherine about this report did she call to refuse her consent ,Pride and Prejudice
to this question his daughter replied only with a laugh and as it had been asked without the least suspicion she was not distressed by his repeating it elizabeth had never been more at a loss to make her feelings appear what they were not it was necessary to laugh when she would rather have cried her father had most cruelly mortified her by what he said of mr darcys indifference and she could do nothing but wonder at such a want of penetration or fear that perhaps instead of his seeing too little she might have fancied too much ,Pride and Prejudice
instead of receiving any such letter of excuse from his friend as elizabeth half expected mr bingley to do he was able to bring darcy with him to longbourn before many days had passed after lady catherines visit the gentlemen arrived early and before mrs bennet had time to tell him of their having seen his aunt of which her daughter sat in momentary dread bingley who wanted to be alone with jane proposed their all walking out it was agreed to mrs bennet was not in the habit of walking mary could never spare time but the remaining five set off together bingley and jane however soon allowed the others to outstrip them they lagged behind while elizabeth kitty and darcy were to entertain each other very little was said by either kitty was too much afraid of him to talk elizabeth was secretly forming a desperate resolution and perhaps he might be doing the same ,Pride and Prejudice
they walked towards the lucases because kitty wished to call upon maria and as elizabeth saw no occasion for making it a general concern when kitty left them she went boldly on with him alone now was the moment for her resolution to be executed and while her courage was high she immediately said ,Pride and Prejudice
mr darcy i am a very selfish creature and for the sake of giving relief to my own feelings care not how much i may be wounding yours i can no longer help thanking you for your unexampled kindness to my poor sister ever since i have known it i have been most anxious to acknowledge to you how gratefully i feel it were it known to the rest of my family i should not have merely my own gratitude to express ,Pride and Prejudice
i am sorry exceedingly sorry replied darcy in a tone of surprise and emotion that you have ever been informed of what may in a mistaken light have given you uneasiness i did not think mrs gardiner was so little to be trusted ,Pride and Prejudice
you must not blame my aunt lydias thoughtlessness first betrayed to me that you had been concerned in the matter and of course i could not rest till i knew the particulars let me thank you again and again in the name of all my family for that generous compassion which induced you to take so much trouble and bear so many mortifications for the sake of discovering them ,Pride and Prejudice
if you will thank me he replied let it be for yourself alone that the wish of giving happiness to you might add force to the other inducements which led me on i shall not attempt to deny but your family owe me nothing much as i respect them i believe i thought only of you ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth was too much embarrassed to say a word after a short pause her companion added you are too generous to trifle with me if your feelings are still what they were last april tell me so at once my affections and wishes are unchanged but one word from you will silence me on this subject for ever ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth feeling all the more than common awkwardness and anxiety of his situation now forced herself to speak and immediately though not very fluently gave him to understand that her sentiments had undergone so material a change since the period to which he alluded as to make her receive with gratitude and pleasure his present assurances the happiness which this reply produced was such as he had probably never felt before and he expressed himself on the occasion as sensibly and as warmly as a man violently in love can be supposed to do had elizabeth been able to encounter his eye she might have seen how well the expression of heartfelt delight diffused over his face became him but though she could not look she could listen and he told her of feelings which in proving of what importance she was to him made his affection every moment more valuable ,Pride and Prejudice
they walked on without knowing in what direction there was too much to be thought and felt and said for attention to any other objects she soon learnt that they were indebted for their present good understanding to the efforts of his aunt who did call on him in her return through london and there relate her journey to longbourn its motive and the substance of her conversation with elizabeth dwelling emphatically on every expression of the latter which in her ladyships apprehension peculiarly denoted her perverseness and assurance in the belief that such a relation must assist her endeavours to obtain that promise from her nephew which she had refused to give but unluckily for her ladyship its effect had been exactly contrariwise ,Pride and Prejudice
it taught me to hope said he as i had scarcely ever allowed myself to hope before i knew enough of your disposition to be certain that had you been absolutely irrevocably decided against me you would have acknowledged it to lady catherine frankly and openly ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth coloured and laughed as she replied yes you know enough of my frankness to believe me capable of that after abusing you so abominably to your face i could have no scruple in abusing you to all your relations ,Pride and Prejudice
what did you say of me that i did not deserve for though your accusations were illfounded formed on mistaken premises my behaviour to you at the time had merited the severest reproof it was unpardonable i cannot think of it without abhorrence ,Pride and Prejudice
we will not quarrel for the greater share of blame annexed to that evening said elizabeth the conduct of neither if strictly examined will be irreproachable but since then we have both i hope improved in civility ,Pride and Prejudice
i cannot be so easily reconciled to myself the recollection of what i then said of my conduct my manners my expressions during the whole of it is now and has been many months inexpressibly painful to me your reproof so well applied i shall never forget had you behaved in a more gentlemanlike manner those were your words you know not you can scarcely conceive how they have tortured methough it was some time i confess before i was reasonable enough to allow their justice ,Pride and Prejudice
i can easily believe it you thought me then devoid of every proper feeling i am sure you did the turn of your countenance i shall never forget as you said that i could not have addressed you in any possible way that would induce you to accept me ,Pride and Prejudice
i knew said he that what i wrote must give you pain but it was necessary i hope you have destroyed the letter there was one part especially the opening of it which i should dread your having the power of reading again i can remember some expressions which might justly make you hate me ,Pride and Prejudice
the letter shall certainly be burnt if you believe it essential to the preservation of my regard but though we have both reason to think my opinions not entirely unalterable they are not i hope quite so easily changed as that implies ,Pride and Prejudice
the letter perhaps began in bitterness but it did not end so the adieu is charity itself but think no more of the letter the feelings of the person who wrote and the person who received it are now so widely different from what they were then that every unpleasant circumstance attending it ought to be forgotten you must learn some of my philosophy think only of the past as its remembrance gives you pleasure ,Pride and Prejudice
i cannot give you credit for any philosophy of the kind your retrospections must be so totally void of reproach that the contentment arising from them is not of philosophy but what is much better of innocence but with me it is not so painful recollections will intrude which cannot which ought not to be repelled i have been a selfish being all my life in practice though not in principle as a child i was taught what was right but i was not taught to correct my temper i was given good principles but left to follow them in pride and conceit unfortunately an only son for many years an only child i was spoilt by my parents who though good themselves my father particularly all that was benevolent and amiable allowed encouraged almost taught me to be selfish and overbearing to care for none beyond my own family circle to think meanly of all the rest of the world to wish at least to think meanly of their sense and worth compared with my own such i was from eight to eight and twenty and such i might still have been but for you dearest loveliest elizabeth what do i not owe you you taught me a lesson hard indeed at first but most advantageous by you i was properly humbled i came to you without a doubt of my reception you showed me how insufficient were all my pretensions to please a woman worthy of being pleased ,Pride and Prejudice
my manners must have been in fault but not intentionally i assure you i never meant to deceive you but my spirits might often lead me wrong how you must have hated me after that evening ,Pride and Prejudice
your surprise could not be greater than mine in being noticed by you my conscience told me that i deserved no extraordinary politeness and i confess that i did not expect to receive more than my due ,Pride and Prejudice
my object then replied darcy was to show you by every civility in my power that i was not so mean as to resent the past and i hoped to obtain your forgiveness to lessen your ill opinion by letting you see that your reproofs had been attended to how soon any other wishes introduced themselves i can hardly tell but i believe in about half an hour after i had seen you ,Pride and Prejudice
he then told her of georgianas delight in her acquaintance and of her disappointment at its sudden interruption which naturally leading to the cause of that interruption she soon learnt that his resolution of following her from derbyshire in quest of her sister had been formed before he quitted the inn and that his gravity and thoughtfulness there had arisen from no other struggles than what such a purpose must comprehend ,Pride and Prejudice
what could become of mr bingley and jane was a wonder which introduced the discussion of their affairs darcy was delighted with their engagement his friend had given him the earliest information of it ,Pride and Prejudice
on the evening before my going to london said he i made a confession to him which i believe i ought to have made long ago i told him of all that had occurred to make my former interference in his affairs absurd and impertinent his surprise was great he had never had the slightest suspicion i told him moreover that i believed myself mistaken in supposing as i had done that your sister was indifferent to him and as i could easily perceive that his attachment to her was unabated i felt no doubt of their happiness together ,Pride and Prejudice
it did bingley is most unaffectedly modest his diffidence had prevented his depending on his own judgment in so anxious a case but his reliance on mine made every thing easy i was obliged to confess one thing which for a time and not unjustly offended him i could not allow myself to conceal that your sister had been in town three months last winter that i had known it and purposely kept it from him he was angry but his anger i am persuaded lasted no longer than he remained in any doubt of your sisters sentiments he has heartily forgiven me now ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth longed to observe that mr bingley had been a most delightful friend so easily guided that his worth was invaluable but she checked herself she remembered that he had yet to learn to be laughed at and it was rather too early to begin in anticipating the happiness of bingley which of course was to be inferior only to his own he continued the conversation till they reached the house in the hall they parted ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear lizzy where can you have been walking to was a question which elizabeth received from jane as soon as she entered their room and from all the others when they sat down to table she had only to say in reply that they had wandered about till she was beyond her own knowledge she coloured as she spoke but neither that nor anything else awakened a suspicion of the truth ,Pride and Prejudice
the evening passed quietly unmarked by anything extraordinary the acknowledged lovers talked and laughed the unacknowledged were silent darcy was not of a disposition in which happiness overflows in mirth and elizabeth agitated and confused rather knew that she was happy than felt herself to be so for besides the immediate embarrassment there were other evils before her she anticipated what would be felt in the family when her situation became known she was aware that no one liked him but jane and even feared that with the others it was a dislike which not all his fortune and consequence might do away ,Pride and Prejudice
this is a wretched beginning indeed my sole dependence was on you and i am sure nobody else will believe me if you do not yet indeed i am in earnest i speak nothing but the truth he still loves me and we are engaged ,Pride and Prejudice
you know nothing of the matter that is all to be forgot perhaps i did not always love him so well as i do now but in such cases as these a good memory is unpardonable this is the last time i shall ever remember it myself ,Pride and Prejudice
good heaven can it be really so yet now i must believe you cried jane my dear dear lizzy i wouldi do congratulate youbut are you certain forgive the questionare you quite certain that you can be happy with him ,Pride and Prejudice
very very much nothing could give either bingley or myself more delight but we considered it we talked of it as impossible and do you really love him quite well enough oh lizzy do anything rather than marry without affection are you quite sure that you feel what you ought to do ,Pride and Prejudice
another entreaty that she would be serious however produced the desired effect and she soon satisfied jane by her solemn assurances of attachment when convinced on that article miss bennet had nothing further to wish ,Pride and Prejudice
now i am quite happy said she for you will be as happy as myself i always had a value for him were it for nothing but his love of you i must always have esteemed him but now as bingleys friend and your husband there can be only bingley and yourself more dear to me but lizzy you have been very sly very reserved with me how little did you tell me of what passed at pemberley and lambton i owe all that i know of it to another not to you ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth told her the motives of her secrecy she had been unwilling to mention bingley and the unsettled state of her own feelings had made her equally avoid the name of his friend but now she would no longer conceal from her his share in lydias marriage all was acknowledged and half the night spent in conversation ,Pride and Prejudice
good gracious cried mrs bennet as she stood at a window the next morning if that disagreeable mr darcy is not coming here again with our dear bingley what can he mean by being so tiresome as to be always coming here i had no notion but he would go ashooting or something or other and not disturb us with his company what shall we do with him lizzy you must walk out with him again that he may not be in bingleys way ,Pride and Prejudice
as soon as they entered bingley looked at her so expressively and shook hands with such warmth as left no doubt of his good information and he soon afterwards said aloud mrs bennet have you no more lanes hereabouts in which lizzy may lose her way again today ,Pride and Prejudice
it may do very well for the others replied mr bingley but i am sure it will be too much for kitty wont it kitty kitty owned that she had rather stay at home darcy professed a great curiosity to see the view from the mount and elizabeth silently consented as she went up stairs to get ready mrs bennet followed her saying ,Pride and Prejudice
i am quite sorry lizzy that you should be forced to have that disagreeable man all to yourself but i hope you will not mind it it is all for janes sake you know and there is no occasion for talking to him except just now and then so do not put yourself to inconvenience ,Pride and Prejudice
during their walk it was resolved that mr bennets consent should be asked in the course of the evening elizabeth reserved to herself the application for her mothers she could not determine how her mother would take it sometimes doubting whether all his wealth and grandeur would be enough to overcome her abhorrence of the man but whether she were violently set against the match or violently delighted with it it was certain that her manner would be equally ill adapted to do credit to her sense and she could no more bear that mr darcy should hear the first raptures of her joy than the first vehemence of her disapprobation ,Pride and Prejudice
in the evening soon after mr bennet withdrew to the library she saw mr darcy rise also and follow him and her agitation on seeing it was extreme she did not fear her fathers opposition but he was going to be made unhappy and that it should be through her meansthat she his favourite child should be distressing him by her choice should be filling him with fears and regrets in disposing of herwas a wretched reflection and she sat in misery till mr darcy appeared again when looking at him she was a little relieved by his smile in a few minutes he approached the table where she was sitting with kitty and while pretending to admire her work said in a whisper go to your father he wants you in the library she was gone directly ,Pride and Prejudice
how earnestly did she then wish that her former opinions had been more reasonable her expressions more moderate it would have spared her from explanations and professions which it was exceedingly awkward to give but they were now necessary and she assured him with some confusion of her attachment to mr darcy ,Pride and Prejudice
i do i do like him she replied with tears in her eyes i love him indeed he has no improper pride he is perfectly amiable you do not know what he really is then pray do not pain me by speaking of him in such terms ,Pride and Prejudice
lizzy said her father i have given him my consent he is the kind of man indeed to whom i should never dare refuse anything which he condescended to ask i now give it to you if you are resolved on having him but let me advise you to think better of it i know your disposition lizzy i know that you could be neither happy nor respectable unless you truly esteemed your husband unless you looked up to him as a superior your lively talents would place you in the greatest danger in an unequal marriage you could scarcely escape discredit and misery my child let me not have the grief of seeing you unable to respect your partner in life you know not what you are about ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeth still more affected was earnest and solemn in her reply and at length by repeated assurances that mr darcy was really the object of her choice by explaining the gradual change which her estimation of him had undergone relating her absolute certainty that his affection was not the work of a day but had stood the test of many months suspense and enumerating with energy all his good qualities she did conquer her fathers incredulity and reconcile him to the match ,Pride and Prejudice
this is an evening of wonders indeed and so darcy did every thing made up the match gave the money paid the fellows debts and got him his commission so much the better it will save me a world of trouble and economy had it been your uncles doing i must and would have paid him but these violent young lovers carry every thing their own way i shall offer to pay him tomorrow he will rant and storm about his love for you and there will be an end of the matter ,Pride and Prejudice
he then recollected her embarrassment a few days before on his reading mr collinss letter and after laughing at her some time allowed her at last to gosaying as she quitted the room if any young men come for mary or kitty send them in for i am quite at leisure ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths mind was now relieved from a very heavy weight and after half an hours quiet reflection in her own room she was able to join the others with tolerable composure every thing was too recent for gaiety but the evening passed tranquilly away there was no longer anything material to be dreaded and the comfort of ease and familiarity would come in time ,Pride and Prejudice
when her mother went up to her dressingroom at night she followed her and made the important communication its effect was most extraordinary for on first hearing it mrs bennet sat quite still and unable to utter a syllable nor was it under many many minutes that she could comprehend what she heard though not in general backward to credit what was for the advantage of her family or that came in the shape of a lover to any of them she began at length to recover to fidget about in her chair get up sit down again wonder and bless herself ,Pride and Prejudice
good gracious lord bless me only think dear me mr darcy who would have thought it and is it really true oh my sweetest lizzy how rich and how great you will be what pinmoney what jewels what carriages you will have janes is nothing to itnothing at all i am so pleasedso happy such a charming manso handsome so talloh my dear lizzy pray apologise for my having disliked him so much before i hope he will overlook it dear dear lizzy a house in town every thing that is charming three daughters married ten thousand a year oh lord what will become of me i shall go distracted ,Pride and Prejudice
this was enough to prove that her approbation need not be doubted and elizabeth rejoicing that such an effusion was heard only by herself soon went away but before she had been three minutes in her own room her mother followed her ,Pride and Prejudice
my dearest child she cried i can think of nothing else ten thousand a year and very likely more tis as good as a lord and a special licence you must and shall be married by a special licence but my dearest love tell me what dish mr darcy is particularly fond of that i may have it tomorrow ,Pride and Prejudice
this was a sad omen of what her mothers behaviour to the gentleman himself might be and elizabeth found that though in the certain possession of his warmest affection and secure of her relations consent there was still something to be wished for but the morrow passed off much better than she expected for mrs bennet luckily stood in such awe of her intended soninlaw that she ventured not to speak to him unless it was in her power to offer him any attention or mark her deference for his opinion ,Pride and Prejudice
elizabeths spirits soon rising to playfulness again she wanted mr darcy to account for his having ever fallen in love with her how could you begin said she i can comprehend your going on charmingly when you had once made a beginning but what could set you off in the first place ,Pride and Prejudice
my beauty you had early withstood and as for my mannersmy behaviour to you was at least always bordering on the uncivil and i never spoke to you without rather wishing to give you pain than not now be sincere did you admire me for my impertinence ,Pride and Prejudice
you may as well call it impertinence at once it was very little less the fact is that you were sick of civility of deference of officious attention you were disgusted with the women who were always speaking and looking and thinking for your approbation alone i roused and interested you because i was so unlike them had you not been really amiable you would have hated me for it but in spite of the pains you took to disguise yourself your feelings were always noble and just and in your heart you thoroughly despised the persons who so assiduously courted you therei have saved you the trouble of accounting for it and really all things considered i begin to think it perfectly reasonable to be sure you knew no actual good of mebut nobody thinks of that when they fall in love ,Pride and Prejudice
dearest jane who could have done less for her but make a virtue of it by all means my good qualities are under your protection and you are to exaggerate them as much as possible and in return it belongs to me to find occasions for teasing and quarrelling with you as often as may be and i shall begin directly by asking you what made you so unwilling to come to the point at last what made you so shy of me when you first called and afterwards dined here why especially when you called did you look as if you did not care about me ,Pride and Prejudice
how unlucky that you should have a reasonable answer to give and that i should be so reasonable as to admit it but i wonder how long you would have gone on if you had been left to yourself i wonder when you would have spoken if i had not asked you my resolution of thanking you for your kindness to lydia had certainly great effect too much i am afraid for what becomes of the moral if our comfort springs from a breach of promise for i ought not to have mentioned the subject this will never do ,Pride and Prejudice
you need not distress yourself the moral will be perfectly fair lady catherines unjustifiable endeavours to separate us were the means of removing all my doubts i am not indebted for my present happiness to your eager desire of expressing your gratitude i was not in a humour to wait for any opening of yours my aunts intelligence had given me hope and i was determined at once to know every thing ,Pride and Prejudice
lady catherine has been of infinite use which ought to make her happy for she loves to be of use but tell me what did you come down to netherfield for was it merely to ride to longbourn and be embarrassed or had you intended any more serious consequence ,Pride and Prejudice
my real purpose was to see you and to judge if i could whether i might ever hope to make you love me my avowed one or what i avowed to myself was to see whether your sister were still partial to bingley and if she were to make the confession to him which i have since made ,Pride and Prejudice
and if i had not a letter to write myself i might sit by you and admire the evenness of your writing as another young lady once did but i have an aunt too who must not be longer neglected ,Pride and Prejudice
from an unwillingness to confess how much her intimacy with mr darcy had been overrated elizabeth had never yet answered mrs gardiners long letter but now having that to communicate which she knew would be most welcome she was almost ashamed to find that her uncle and aunt had already lost three days of happiness and immediately wrote as follows ,Pride and Prejudice
i would have thanked you before my dear aunt as i ought to have done for your long kind satisfactory detail of particulars but to say the truth i was too cross to write you supposed more than really existed but now suppose as much as you choose give a loose rein to your fancy indulge your imagination in every possible flight which the subject will afford and unless you believe me actually married you cannot greatly err you must write again very soon and praise him a great deal more than you did in your last i thank you again and again for not going to the lakes how could i be so silly as to wish it your idea of the ponies is delightful we will go round the park every day i am the happiest creature in the world perhaps other people have said so before but not one with such justice i am happier even than jane she only smiles i laugh mr darcy sends you all the love in the world that he can spare from me you are all to come to pemberley at christmas yours etc ,Pride and Prejudice
dear sir i must trouble you once more for congratulations elizabeth will soon be the wife of mr darcy console lady catherine as well as you can but if i were you i would stand by the nephew he has more to give ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bingleys congratulations to her brother on his approaching marriage were all that was affectionate and insincere she wrote even to jane on the occasion to express her delight and repeat all her former professions of regard jane was not deceived but she was affected and though feeling no reliance on her could not help writing her a much kinder answer than she knew was deserved ,Pride and Prejudice
the joy which miss darcy expressed on receiving similar information was as sincere as her brothers in sending it four sides of paper were insufficient to contain all her delight and all her earnest desire of being loved by her sister ,Pride and Prejudice
before any answer could arrive from mr collins or any congratulations to elizabeth from his wife the longbourn family heard that the collinses were come themselves to lucas lodge the reason of this sudden removal was soon evident lady catherine had been rendered so exceedingly angry by the contents of her nephews letter that charlotte really rejoicing in the match was anxious to get away till the storm was blown over at such a moment the arrival of her friend was a sincere pleasure to elizabeth though in the course of their meetings she must sometimes think the pleasure dearly bought when she saw mr darcy exposed to all the parading and obsequious civility of her husband he bore it however with admirable calmness he could even listen to sir william lucas when he complimented him on carrying away the brightest jewel of the country and expressed his hopes of their all meeting frequently at st jamess with very decent composure if he did shrug his shoulders it was not till sir william was out of sight ,Pride and Prejudice
mrs phillipss vulgarity was another and perhaps a greater tax on his forbearance and though mrs phillips as well as her sister stood in too much awe of him to speak with the familiarity which bingleys good humour encouraged yet whenever she did speak she must be vulgar nor was her respect for him though it made her more quiet at all likely to make her more elegant elizabeth did all she could to shield him from the frequent notice of either and was ever anxious to keep him to herself and to those of her family with whom he might converse without mortification and though the uncomfortable feelings arising from all this took from the season of courtship much of its pleasure it added to the hope of the future and she looked forward with delight to the time when they should be removed from society so little pleasing to either to all the comfort and elegance of their family party at pemberley ,Pride and Prejudice
happy for all her maternal feelings was the day on which mrs bennet got rid of her two most deserving daughters with what delighted pride she afterwards visited mrs bingley and talked of mrs darcy may be guessed i wish i could say for the sake of her family that the accomplishment of her earnest desire in the establishment of so many of her children produced so happy an effect as to make her a sensible amiable wellinformed woman for the rest of her life though perhaps it was lucky for her husband who might not have relished domestic felicity in so unusual a form that she still was occasionally nervous and invariably silly ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bennet missed his second daughter exceedingly his affection for her drew him oftener from home than anything else could do he delighted in going to pemberley especially when he was least expected ,Pride and Prejudice
mr bingley and jane remained at netherfield only a twelvemonth so near a vicinity to her mother and meryton relations was not desirable even to his easy temper or her affectionate heart the darling wish of his sisters was then gratified he bought an estate in a neighbouring county to derbyshire and jane and elizabeth in addition to every other source of happiness were within thirty miles of each other ,Pride and Prejudice
kitty to her very material advantage spent the chief of her time with her two elder sisters in society so superior to what she had generally known her improvement was great she was not of so ungovernable a temper as lydia and removed from the influence of lydias example she became by proper attention and management less irritable less ignorant and less insipid from the further disadvantage of lydias society she was of course carefully kept and though mrs wickham frequently invited her to come and stay with her with the promise of balls and young men her father would never consent to her going ,Pride and Prejudice
mary was the only daughter who remained at home and she was necessarily drawn from the pursuit of accomplishments by mrs bennets being quite unable to sit alone mary was obliged to mix more with the world but she could still moralize over every morning visit and as she was no longer mortified by comparisons between her sisters beauty and her own it was suspected by her father that she submitted to the change without much reluctance ,Pride and Prejudice
as for wickham and lydia their characters suffered no revolution from the marriage of her sisters he bore with philosophy the conviction that elizabeth must now become acquainted with whatever of his ingratitude and falsehood had before been unknown to her and in spite of every thing was not wholly without hope that darcy might yet be prevailed on to make his fortune the congratulatory letter which elizabeth received from lydia on her marriage explained to her that by his wife at least if not by himself such a hope was cherished the letter was to this effect ,Pride and Prejudice
my dear lizzy i wish you joy if you love mr darcy half as well as i do my dear wickham you must be very happy it is a great comfort to have you so rich and when you have nothing else to do i hope you will think of us i am sure wickham would like a place at court very much and i do not think we shall have quite money enough to live upon without some help any place would do of about three or four hundred a year but however do not speak to mr darcy about it if you had rather not ,Pride and Prejudice
as it happened that elizabeth had much rather not she endeavoured in her answer to put an end to every entreaty and expectation of the kind such relief however as it was in her power to afford by the practice of what might be called economy in her own private expences she frequently sent them it had always been evident to her that such an income as theirs under the direction of two persons so extravagant in their wants and heedless of the future must be very insufficient to their support and whenever they changed their quarters either jane or herself were sure of being applied to for some little assistance towards discharging their bills their manner of living even when the restoration of peace dismissed them to a home was unsettled in the extreme they were always moving from place to place in quest of a cheap situation and always spending more than they ought his affection for her soon sunk into indifference hers lasted a little longer and in spite of her youth and her manners she retained all the claims to reputation which her marriage had given her ,Pride and Prejudice
though darcy could never receive him at pemberley yet for elizabeths sake he assisted him further in his profession lydia was occasionally a visitor there when her husband was gone to enjoy himself in london or bath and with the bingleys they both of them frequently staid so long that even bingleys good humour was overcome and he proceeded so far as to talk of giving them a hint to be gone ,Pride and Prejudice
miss bingley was very deeply mortified by darcys marriage but as she thought it advisable to retain the right of visiting at pemberley she dropt all her resentment was fonder than ever of georgiana almost as attentive to darcy as heretofore and paid off every arrear of civility to elizabeth ,Pride and Prejudice
pemberley was now georgianas home and the attachment of the sisters was exactly what darcy had hoped to see they were able to love each other even as well as they intended georgiana had the highest opinion in the world of elizabeth though at first she often listened with an astonishment bordering on alarm at her lively sportive manner of talking to her brother he who had always inspired in herself a respect which almost overcame her affection she now saw the object of open pleasantry her mind received knowledge which had never before fallen in her way by elizabeths instructions she began to comprehend that a woman may take liberties with her husband which a brother will not always allow in a sister more than ten years younger than himself ,Pride and Prejudice
lady catherine was extremely indignant on the marriage of her nephew and as she gave way to all the genuine frankness of her character in her reply to the letter which announced its arrangement she sent him language so very abusive especially of elizabeth that for some time all intercourse was at an end but at length by elizabeths persuasion he was prevailed on to overlook the offence and seek a reconciliation and after a little further resistance on the part of his aunt her resentment gave way either to her affection for him or her curiosity to see how his wife conducted herself and she condescended to wait on them at pemberley in spite of that pollution which its woods had received not merely from the presence of such a mistress but the visits of her uncle and aunt from the city ,Pride and Prejudice
with the gardiners they were always on the most intimate terms darcy as well as elizabeth really loved them and they were both ever sensible of the warmest gratitude towards the persons who by bringing her into derbyshire had been the means of uniting them ,Pride and Prejudice
the artist is the creator of beautiful things to reveal art and conceal the artist is arts aim the critic is he who can translate into another manner or a new material his impression of beautiful things ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the nineteenth century dislike of romanticism is the rage of caliban not seeing his own face in a glass the moral life of man forms part of the subjectmatter of the artist but the morality of art consists in the perfect use of an imperfect medium no artist desires to prove anything even things that are true can be proved no artist has ethical sympathies an ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style no artist is ever morbid the artist can express everything thought and language are to the artist instruments of an art vice and virtue are to the artist materials for an art from the point of view of form the type of all the arts is the art of the musician from the point of view of feeling the actors craft is the type all art is at once surface and symbol those who go beneath the surface do so at their peril those who read the symbol do so at their peril it is the spectator and not life that art really mirrors diversity of opinion about a work of art shows that the work is new complex and vital when critics disagree the artist is in accord with himself we can forgive a man for making a useful thing as long as he does not admire it the only excuse for making a useless thing is that one admires it intensely ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the studio was filled with the rich odour of roses and when the light summer wind stirred amidst the trees of the garden there came through the open door the heavy scent of the lilac or the more delicate perfume of the pinkflowering thorn ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
from the corner of the divan of persian saddlebags on which he was lying smoking as was his custom innumerable cigarettes lord henry wotton could just catch the gleam of the honeysweet and honeycoloured blossoms of a laburnum whose tremulous branches seemed hardly able to bear the burden of a beauty so flamelike as theirs and now and then the fantastic shadows of birds in flight flitted across the long tussoresilk curtains that were stretched in front of the huge window producing a kind of momentary japanese effect and making him think of those pallid jadefaced painters of tokyo who through the medium of an art that is necessarily immobile seek to convey the sense of swiftness and motion the sullen murmur of the bees shouldering their way through the long unmown grass or circling with monotonous insistence round the dusty gilt horns of the straggling woodbine seemed to make the stillness more oppressive the dim roar of london was like the bourdon note of a distant organ ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
in the centre of the room clamped to an upright easel stood the fulllength portrait of a young man of extraordinary personal beauty and in front of it some little distance away was sitting the artist himself basil hallward whose sudden disappearance some years ago caused at the time such public excitement and gave rise to so many strange conjectures ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as the painter looked at the gracious and comely form he had so skilfully mirrored in his art a smile of pleasure passed across his face and seemed about to linger there but he suddenly started up and closing his eyes placed his fingers upon the lids as though he sought to imprison within his brain some curious dream from which he feared he might awake ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it is your best work basil the best thing you have ever done said lord henry languidly you must certainly send it next year to the grosvenor the academy is too large and too vulgar whenever i have gone there there have been either so many people that i have not been able to see the pictures which was dreadful or so many pictures that i have not been able to see the people which was worse the grosvenor is really the only place ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry elevated his eyebrows and looked at him in amazement through the thin blue wreaths of smoke that curled up in such fanciful whorls from his heavy opiumtainted cigarette not send it anywhere my dear fellow why have you any reason what odd chaps you painters are you do anything in the world to gain a reputation as soon as you have one you seem to want to throw it away it is silly of you for there is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about and that is not being talked about a portrait like this would set you far above all the young men in england and make the old men quite jealous if old men are ever capable of any emotion ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
too much of yourself in it upon my word basil i didnt know you were so vain and i really cant see any resemblance between you with your rugged strong face and your coalblack hair and this young adonis who looks as if he was made out of ivory and roseleaves why my dear basil he is a narcissus and youwell of course you have an intellectual expression and all that but beauty real beauty ends where an intellectual expression begins intellect is in itself a mode of exaggeration and destroys the harmony of any face the moment one sits down to think one becomes all nose or all forehead or something horrid look at the successful men in any of the learned professions how perfectly hideous they are except of course in the church but then in the church they dont think a bishop keeps on saying at the age of eighty what he was told to say when he was a boy of eighteen and as a natural consequence he always looks absolutely delightful your mysterious young friend whose name you have never told me but whose picture really fascinates me never thinks i feel quite sure of that he is some brainless beautiful creature who should be always here in winter when we have no flowers to look at and always here in summer when we want something to chill our intelligence dont flatter yourself basil you are not in the least like him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you dont understand me harry answered the artist of course i am not like him i know that perfectly well indeed i should be sorry to look like him you shrug your shoulders i am telling you the truth there is a fatality about all physical and intellectual distinction the sort of fatality that seems to dog through history the faltering steps of kings it is better not to be different from ones fellows the ugly and the stupid have the best of it in this world they can sit at their ease and gape at the play if they know nothing of victory they are at least spared the knowledge of defeat they live as we all should liveundisturbed indifferent and without disquiet they neither bring ruin upon others nor ever receive it from alien hands your rank and wealth harry my brains such as they aremy art whatever it may be worth dorian grays good lookswe shall all suffer for what the gods have given us suffer terribly ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh i cant explain when i like people immensely i never tell their names to any one it is like surrendering a part of them i have grown to love secrecy it seems to be the one thing that can make modern life mysterious or marvellous to us the commonest thing is delightful if one only hides it when i leave town now i never tell my people where i am going if i did i would lose all my pleasure it is a silly habit i dare say but somehow it seems to bring a great deal of romance into ones life i suppose you think me awfully foolish about it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
not at all answered lord henry not at all my dear basil you seem to forget that i am married and the one charm of marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties i never know where my wife is and my wife never knows what i am doing when we meetwe do meet occasionally when we dine out together or go down to the dukeswe tell each other the most absurd stories with the most serious faces my wife is very good at itmuch better in fact than i am she never gets confused over her dates and i always do but when she does find me out she makes no row at all i sometimes wish she would but she merely laughs at me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i hate the way you talk about your married life harry said basil hallward strolling towards the door that led into the garden i believe that you are really a very good husband but that you are thoroughly ashamed of your own virtues you are an extraordinary fellow you never say a moral thing and you never do a wrong thing your cynicism is simply a pose ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
being natural is simply a pose and the most irritating pose i know cried lord henry laughing and the two young men went out into the garden together and ensconced themselves on a long bamboo seat that stood in the shade of a tall laurel bush the sunlight slipped over the polished leaves in the grass white daisies were tremulous ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
harry said basil hallward looking him straight in the face every portrait that is painted with feeling is a portrait of the artist not of the sitter the sitter is merely the accident the occasion it is not he who is revealed by the painter it is rather the painter who on the coloured canvas reveals himself the reason i will not exhibit this picture is that i am afraid that i have shown in it the secret of my own soul ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry smiled and leaning down plucked a pinkpetalled daisy from the grass and examined it i am quite sure i shall understand it he replied gazing intently at the little golden whitefeathered disk and as for believing things i can believe anything provided that it is quite incredible ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the wind shook some blossoms from the trees and the heavy lilacblooms with their clustering stars moved to and fro in the languid air a grasshopper began to chirrup by the wall and like a blue thread a long thin dragonfly floated past on its brown gauze wings lord henry felt as if he could hear basil hallwards heart beating and wondered what was coming ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the story is simply this said the painter after some time two months ago i went to a crush at lady brandons you know we poor artists have to show ourselves in society from time to time just to remind the public that we are not savages with an evening coat and a white tie as you told me once anybody even a stockbroker can gain a reputation for being civilized well after i had been in the room about ten minutes talking to huge overdressed dowagers and tedious academicians i suddenly became conscious that some one was looking at me i turned halfway round and saw dorian gray for the first time when our eyes met i felt that i was growing pale a curious sensation of terror came over me i knew that i had come face to face with some one whose mere personality was so fascinating that if i allowed it to do so it would absorb my whole nature my whole soul my very art itself i did not want any external influence in my life you know yourself harry how independent i am by nature i have always been my own master had at least always been so till i met dorian gray thenbut i dont know how to explain it to you something seemed to tell me that i was on the verge of a terrible crisis in my life i had a strange feeling that fate had in store for me exquisite joys and exquisite sorrows i grew afraid and turned to quit the room it was not conscience that made me do so it was a sort of cowardice i take no credit to myself for trying to escape ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i dont believe that harry and i dont believe you do either however whatever was my motiveand it may have been pride for i used to be very proudi certainly struggled to the door there of course i stumbled against lady brandon you are not going to run away so soon mr hallward she screamed out you know her curiously shrill voice ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i could not get rid of her she brought me up to royalties and people with stars and garters and elderly ladies with gigantic tiaras and parrot noses she spoke of me as her dearest friend i had only met her once before but she took it into her head to lionize me i believe some picture of mine had made a great success at the time at least had been chattered about in the penny newspapers which is the nineteenthcentury standard of immortality suddenly i found myself face to face with the young man whose personality had so strangely stirred me we were quite close almost touching our eyes met again it was reckless of me but i asked lady brandon to introduce me to him perhaps it was not so reckless after all it was simply inevitable we would have spoken to each other without any introduction i am sure of that dorian told me so afterwards he too felt that we were destined to know each other ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and how did lady brandon describe this wonderful young man asked his companion i know she goes in for giving a rapid prcis of all her guests i remember her bringing me up to a truculent and redfaced old gentleman covered all over with orders and ribbons and hissing into my ear in a tragic whisper which must have been perfectly audible to everybody in the room the most astounding details i simply fled i like to find out people for myself but lady brandon treats her guests exactly as an auctioneer treats his goods she either explains them entirely away or tells one everything about them except what one wants to know ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh something like charming boypoor dear mother and i absolutely inseparable quite forget what he doesafraid hedoesnt do anythingoh yes plays the pianoor is it the violin dear mr gray neither of us could help laughing and we became friends at once ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
how horribly unjust of you cried lord henry tilting his hat back and looking up at the little clouds that like ravelled skeins of glossy white silk were drifting across the hollowed turquoise of the summer sky yes horribly unjust of you i make a great difference between people i choose my friends for their good looks my acquaintances for their good characters and my enemies for their good intellects a man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies i have not got one who is a fool they are all men of some intellectual power and consequently they all appreciate me is that very vain of me i think it is rather vain ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear fellow i am not quite serious but i cant help detesting my relations i suppose it comes from the fact that none of us can stand other people having the same faults as ourselves i quite sympathize with the rage of the english democracy against what they call the vices of the upper orders the masses feel that drunkenness stupidity and immorality should be their own special property and that if any one of us makes an ass of himself he is poaching on their preserves when poor southwark got into the divorce court their indignation was quite magnificent and yet i dont suppose that ten per cent of the proletariat live correctly ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry stroked his pointed brown beard and tapped the toe of his patentleather boot with a tasselled ebony cane how english you are basil that is the second time you have made that observation if one puts forward an idea to a true englishmanalways a rash thing to dohe never dreams of considering whether the idea is right or wrong the only thing he considers of any importance is whether one believes it oneself now the value of an idea has nothing whatsoever to do with the sincerity of the man who expresses it indeed the probabilities are that the more insincere the man is the more purely intellectual will the idea be as in that case it will not be coloured by either his wants his desires or his prejudices however i dont propose to discuss politics sociology or metaphysics with you i like persons better than principles and i like persons with no principles better than anything else in the world tell me more about mr dorian gray how often do you see him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he is all my art to me now said the painter gravely i sometimes think harry that there are only two eras of any importance in the worlds history the first is the appearance of a new medium for art and the second is the appearance of a new personality for art also what the invention of oilpainting was to the venetians the face of antinous was to late greek sculpture and the face of dorian gray will some day be to me it is not merely that i paint from him draw from him sketch from him of course i have done all that but he is much more to me than a model or a sitter i wont tell you that i am dissatisfied with what i have done of him or that his beauty is such that art cannot express it there is nothing that art cannot express and i know that the work i have done since i met dorian gray is good work is the best work of my life but in some curious wayi wonder will you understand mehis personality has suggested to me an entirely new manner in art an entirely new mode of style i see things differently i think of them differently i can now recreate life in a way that was hidden from me before a dream of form in days of thoughtwho is it who says that i forget but it is what dorian gray has been to me the merely visible presence of this ladfor he seems to me little more than a lad though he is really over twentyhis merely visible presenceah i wonder can you realize all that that means unconsciously he defines for me the lines of a fresh school a school that is to have in it all the passion of the romantic spirit all the perfection of the spirit that is greek the harmony of soul and bodyhow much that is we in our madness have separated the two and have invented a realism that is vulgar an ideality that is void harry if you only knew what dorian gray is to me you remember that landscape of mine for which agnew offered me such a huge price but which i would not part with it is one of the best things i have ever done and why is it so because while i was painting it dorian gray sat beside me some subtle influence passed from him to me and for the first time in my life i saw in the plain woodland the wonder i had always looked for and always missed ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
hallward got up from the seat and walked up and down the garden after some time he came back harry he said dorian gray is to me simply a motive in art you might see nothing in him i see everything in him he is never more present in my work than when no image of him is there he is a suggestion as i have said of a new manner i find him in the curves of certain lines in the loveliness and subtleties of certain colours that is all ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
because without intending it i have put into it some expression of all this curious artistic idolatry of which of course i have never cared to speak to him he knows nothing about it he shall never know anything about it but the world might guess it and i will not bare my soul to their shallow prying eyes my heart shall never be put under their microscope there is too much of myself in the thing harrytoo much of myself ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i hate them for it cried hallward an artist should create beautiful things but should put nothing of his own life into them we live in an age when men treat art as if it were meant to be a form of autobiography we have lost the abstract sense of beauty some day i will show the world what it is and for that reason the world shall never see my portrait of dorian gray ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the painter considered for a few moments he likes me he answered after a pause i know he likes me of course i flatter him dreadfully i find a strange pleasure in saying things to him that i know i shall be sorry for having said as a rule he is charming to me and we sit in the studio and talk of a thousand things now and then however he is horribly thoughtless and seems to take a real delight in giving me pain then i feel harry that i have given away my whole soul to some one who treats it as if it were a flower to put in his coat a bit of decoration to charm his vanity an ornament for a summers day ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
days in summer basil are apt to linger murmured lord henry perhaps you will tire sooner than he will it is a sad thing to think of but there is no doubt that genius lasts longer than beauty that accounts for the fact that we all take such pains to overeducate ourselves in the wild struggle for existence we want to have something that endures and so we fill our minds with rubbish and facts in the silly hope of keeping our place the thoroughly wellinformed manthat is the modern ideal and the mind of the thoroughly wellinformed man is a dreadful thing it is like a bricbrac shop all monsters and dust with everything priced above its proper value i think you will tire first all the same some day you will look at your friend and he will seem to you to be a little out of drawing or you wont like his tone of colour or something you will bitterly reproach him in your own heart and seriously think that he has behaved very badly to you the next time he calls you will be perfectly cold and indifferent it will be a great pity for it will alter you what you have told me is quite a romance a romance of art one might call it and the worst of having a romance of any kind is that it leaves one so unromantic ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
ah my dear basil that is exactly why i can feel it those who are faithful know only the trivial side of love it is the faithless who know loves tragedies and lord henry struck a light on a dainty silver case and began to smoke a cigarette with a selfconscious and satisfied air as if he had summed up the world in a phrase there was a rustle of chirruping sparrows in the green lacquer leaves of the ivy and the blue cloudshadows chased themselves across the grass like swallows how pleasant it was in the garden and how delightful other peoples emotions weremuch more delightful than their ideas it seemed to him ones own soul and the passions of ones friendsthose were the fascinating things in life he pictured to himself with silent amusement the tedious luncheon that he had missed by staying so long with basil hallward had he gone to his aunts he would have been sure to have met lord goodbody there and the whole conversation would have been about the feeding of the poor and the necessity for model lodginghouses each class would have preached the importance of those virtues for whose exercise there was no necessity in their own lives the rich would have spoken on the value of thrift and the idle grown eloquent over the dignity of labour it was charming to have escaped all that as he thought of his aunt an idea seemed to strike him he turned to hallward and said my dear fellow i have just remembered ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dont look so angry basil it was at my aunt lady agathas she told me she had discovered a wonderful young man who was going to help her in the east end and that his name was dorian gray i am bound to state that she never told me he was goodlooking women have no appreciation of good looks at least good women have not she said that he was very earnest and had a beautiful nature i at once pictured to myself a creature with spectacles and lank hair horribly freckled and tramping about on huge feet i wish i had known it was your friend ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
then he looked at lord henry dorian gray is my dearest friend he said he has a simple and a beautiful nature your aunt was quite right in what she said of him dont spoil him dont try to influence him your influence would be bad the world is wide and has many marvellous people in it dont take away from me the one person who gives to my art whatever charm it possesses my life as an artist depends on him mind harry i trust you he spoke very slowly and the words seemed wrung out of him almost against his will ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as they entered they saw dorian gray he was seated at the piano with his back to them turning over the pages of a volume of schumanns forest scenes you must lend me these basil he cried i want to learn them they are perfectly charming ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh i am tired of sitting and i dont want a lifesized portrait of myself answered the lad swinging round on the musicstool in a wilful petulant manner when he caught sight of lord henry a faint blush coloured his cheeks for a moment and he started up i beg your pardon basil but i didnt know you had any one with you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you have not spoiled my pleasure in meeting you mr gray said lord henry stepping forward and extending his hand my aunt has often spoken to me about you you are one of her favourites and i am afraid one of her victims also ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am in lady agathas black books at present answered dorian with a funny look of penitence i promised to go to a club in whitechapel with her last tuesday and i really forgot all about it we were to have played a duet togetherthree duets i believe i dont know what she will say to me i am far too frightened to call ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh i will make your peace with my aunt she is quite devoted to you and i dont think it really matters about your not being there the audience probably thought it was a duet when aunt agatha sits down to the piano she makes quite enough noise for two people ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry looked at him yes he was certainly wonderfully handsome with his finely curved scarlet lips his frank blue eyes his crisp gold hair there was something in his face that made one trust him at once all the candour of youth was there as well as all youths passionate purity one felt that he had kept himself unspotted from the world no wonder basil hallward worshipped him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the painter had been busy mixing his colours and getting his brushes ready he was looking worried and when he heard lord henrys last remark he glanced at him hesitated for a moment and then said harry i want to finish this picture today would you think it awfully rude of me if i asked you to go away ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i dont know that i shall tell you that mr gray it is so tedious a subject that one would have to talk seriously about it but i certainly shall not run away now that you have asked me to stop you dont really mind basil do you you have often told me that you liked your sitters to have some one to chat to ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry took up his hat and gloves you are very pressing basil but i am afraid i must go i have promised to meet a man at the orleans goodbye mr gray come and see me some afternoon in curzon street i am nearly always at home at five oclock write to me when you are coming i should be sorry to miss you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
basil cried dorian gray if lord henry wotton goes i shall go too you never open your lips while you are painting and it is horribly dull standing on a platform and trying to look pleasant ask him to stay i insist upon it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
stay harry to oblige dorian and to oblige me said hallward gazing intently at his picture it is quite true i never talk when i am working and never listen either and it must be dreadfully tedious for my unfortunate sitters i beg you to stay ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the painter laughed i dont think there will be any difficulty about that sit down again harry and now dorian get up on the platform and dont move about too much or pay any attention to what lord henry says he has a very bad influence over all his friends with the single exception of myself ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray stepped up on the dais with the air of a young greek martyr and made a little moue of discontent to lord henry to whom he had rather taken a fancy he was so unlike basil they made a delightful contrast and he had such a beautiful voice after a few moments he said to him have you really a very bad influence lord henry as bad as basil says ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
because to influence a person is to give him ones own soul he does not think his natural thoughts or burn with his natural passions his virtues are not real to him his sins if there are such things as sins are borrowed he becomes an echo of some one elses music an actor of a part that has not been written for him the aim of life is selfdevelopment to realize ones nature perfectlythat is what each of us is here for people are afraid of themselves nowadays they have forgotten the highest of all duties the duty that one owes to ones self of course they are charitable they feed the hungry and clothe the beggar but their own souls starve and are naked courage has gone out of our race perhaps we never really had it the terror of society which is the basis of morals the terror of god which is the secret of religionthese are the two things that govern us and yet ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and yet continued lord henry in his low musical voice and with that graceful wave of the hand that was always so characteristic of him and that he had even in his eton days i believe that if one man were to live out his life fully and completely were to give form to every feeling expression to every thought reality to every dreami believe that the world would gain such a fresh impulse of joy that we would forget all the maladies of medivalism and return to the hellenic idealto something finer richer than the hellenic ideal it may be but the bravest man amongst us is afraid of himself the mutilation of the savage has its tragic survival in the selfdenial that mars our lives we are punished for our refusals every impulse that we strive to strangle broods in the mind and poisons us the body sins once and has done with its sin for action is a mode of purification nothing remains then but the recollection of a pleasure or the luxury of a regret the only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it resist it and your soul grows sick with longing for the things it has forbidden to itself with desire for what its monstrous laws have made monstrous and unlawful it has been said that the great events of the world take place in the brain it is in the brain and the brain only that the great sins of the world take place also you mr gray you yourself with your rosered youth and your rosewhite boyhood you have had passions that have made you afraid thoughts that have filled you with terror daydreams and sleeping dreams whose mere memory might stain your cheek with shame ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for nearly ten minutes he stood there motionless with parted lips and eyes strangely bright he was dimly conscious that entirely fresh influences were at work within him yet they seemed to him to have come really from himself the few words that basils friend had said to himwords spoken by chance no doubt and with wilful paradox in themhad touched some secret chord that had never been touched before but that he felt was now vibrating and throbbing to curious pulses ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
music had stirred him like that music had troubled him many times but music was not articulate it was not a new world but rather another chaos that it created in us words mere words how terrible they were how clear and vivid and cruel one could not escape from them and yet what a subtle magic there was in them they seemed to be able to give a plastic form to formless things and to have a music of their own as sweet as that of viol or of lute mere words was there anything so real as words ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes there had been things in his boyhood that he had not understood he understood them now life suddenly became fierycoloured to him it seemed to him that he had been walking in fire why had he not known it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
with his subtle smile lord henry watched him he knew the precise psychological moment when to say nothing he felt intensely interested he was amazed at the sudden impression that his words had produced and remembering a book that he had read when he was sixteen a book which had revealed to him much that he had not known before he wondered whether dorian gray was passing through a similar experience he had merely shot an arrow into the air had it hit the mark how fascinating the lad was ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear fellow i am so sorry when i am painting i cant think of anything else but you never sat better you were perfectly still and i have caught the effect i wantedthe halfparted lips and the bright look in the eyes i dont know what harry has been saying to you but he has certainly made you have the most wonderful expression i suppose he has been paying you compliments you mustnt believe a word that he says ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you know you believe it all said lord henry looking at him with his dreamy languorous eyes i will go out to the garden with you it is horribly hot in the studio basil let us have something iced to drink something with strawberries in it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
certainly harry just touch the bell and when parker comes i will tell him what you want i have got to work up this background so i will join you later on dont keep dorian too long i have never been in better form for painting than i am today this is going to be my masterpiece it is my masterpiece as it stands ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry went out to the garden and found dorian gray burying his face in the great cool lilacblossoms feverishly drinking in their perfume as if it had been wine he came close to him and put his hand upon his shoulder you are quite right to do that he murmured nothing can cure the soul but the senses just as nothing can cure the senses but the soul ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the lad started and drew back he was bareheaded and the leaves had tossed his rebellious curls and tangled all their gilded threads there was a look of fear in his eyes such as people have when they are suddenly awakened his finely chiselled nostrils quivered and some hidden nerve shook the scarlet of his lips and left them trembling ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes continued lord henry that is one of the great secrets of lifeto cure the soul by means of the senses and the senses by means of the soul you are a wonderful creation you know more than you think you know just as you know less than you want to know ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray frowned and turned his head away he could not help liking the tall graceful young man who was standing by him his romantic olivecoloured face and worn expression interested him there was something in his low languid voice that was absolutely fascinating his cool white flowerlike hands even had a curious charm they moved as he spoke like music and seemed to have a language of their own but he felt afraid of him and ashamed of being afraid why had it been left for a stranger to reveal him to himself he had known basil hallward for months but the friendship between them had never altered him suddenly there had come some one across his life who seemed to have disclosed to him lifes mystery and yet what was there to be afraid of he was not a schoolboy or a girl it was absurd to be frightened ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
let us go and sit in the shade said lord henry parker has brought out the drinks and if you stay any longer in this glare you will be quite spoiled and basil will never paint you again you really must not allow yourself to become sunburnt it would be unbecoming ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
no you dont feel it now some day when you are old and wrinkled and ugly when thought has seared your forehead with its lines and passion branded your lips with its hideous fires you will feel it you will feel it terribly now wherever you go you charm the world will it always be so  you have a wonderfully beautiful face mr gray dont frown you have and beauty is a form of geniusis higher indeed than genius as it needs no explanation it is of the great facts of the world like sunlight or springtime or the reflection in dark waters of that silver shell we call the moon it cannot be questioned it has its divine right of sovereignty it makes princes of those who have it you smile ah when you have lost it you wont smile people say sometimes that beauty is only superficial that may be so but at least it is not so superficial as thought is to me beauty is the wonder of wonders it is only shallow people who do not judge by appearances the true mystery of the world is the visible not the invisible yes mr gray the gods have been good to you but what the gods give they quickly take away you have only a few years in which to live really perfectly and fully when your youth goes your beauty will go with it and then you will suddenly discover that there are no triumphs left for you or have to content yourself with those mean triumphs that the memory of your past will make more bitter than defeats every month as it wanes brings you nearer to something dreadful time is jealous of you and wars against your lilies and your roses you will become sallow and hollowcheeked and dulleyed you will suffer horribly ah realize your youth while you have it dont squander the gold of your days listening to the tedious trying to improve the hopeless failure or giving away your life to the ignorant the common and the vulgar these are the sickly aims the false ideals of our age live live the wonderful life that is in you let nothing be lost upon you be always searching for new sensations be afraid of nothing a new hedonismthat is what our century wants you might be its visible symbol with your personality there is nothing you could not do the world belongs to you for a season the moment i met you i saw that you were quite unconscious of what you really are of what you really might be there was so much in you that charmed me that i felt i must tell you something about yourself i thought how tragic it would be if you were wasted for there is such a little time that your youth will lastsuch a little time the common hillflowers wither but they blossom again the laburnum will be as yellow next june as it is now in a month there will be purple stars on the clematis and year after year the green night of its leaves will hold its purple stars but we never get back our youth the pulse of joy that beats in us at twenty becomes sluggish our limbs fail our senses rot we degenerate into hideous puppets haunted by the memory of the passions of which we were too much afraid and the exquisite temptations that we had not the courage to yield to youth youth there is absolutely nothing in the world but youth ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray listened openeyed and wondering the spray of lilac fell from his hand upon the gravel a furry bee came and buzzed round it for a moment then it began to scramble all over the oval stellated globe of the tiny blossoms he watched it with that strange interest in trivial things that we try to develop when things of high import make us afraid or when we are stirred by some new emotion for which we cannot find expression or when some thought that terrifies us lays sudden siege to the brain and calls on us to yield after a time the bee flew away he saw it creeping into the stained trumpet of a tyrian convolvulus the flower seemed to quiver and then swayed gently to and fro ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
always that is a dreadful word it makes me shudder when i hear it women are so fond of using it they spoil every romance by trying to make it last for ever it is a meaningless word too the only difference between a caprice and a lifelong passion is that the caprice lasts a little longer ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as they entered the studio dorian gray put his hand upon lord henrys arm in that case let our friendship be a caprice he murmured flushing at his own boldness then stepped up on the platform and resumed his pose ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry flung himself into a large wicker armchair and watched him the sweep and dash of the brush on the canvas made the only sound that broke the stillness except when now and then hallward stepped back to look at his work from a distance in the slanting beams that streamed through the open doorway the dust danced and was golden the heavy scent of the roses seemed to brood over everything ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after about a quarter of an hour hallward stopped painting looked for a long time at dorian gray and then for a long time at the picture biting the end of one of his huge brushes and frowning it is quite finished he cried at last and stooping down he wrote his name in long vermilion letters on the lefthand corner of the canvas ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian made no answer but passed listlessly in front of his picture and turned towards it when he saw it he drew back and his cheeks flushed for a moment with pleasure a look of joy came into his eyes as if he had recognized himself for the first time he stood there motionless and in wonder dimly conscious that hallward was speaking to him but not catching the meaning of his words the sense of his own beauty came on him like a revelation he had never felt it before basil hallwards compliments had seemed to him to be merely the charming exaggeration of friendship he had listened to them laughed at them forgotten them they had not influenced his nature then had come lord henry wotton with his strange panegyric on youth his terrible warning of its brevity that had stirred him at the time and now as he stood gazing at the shadow of his own loveliness the full reality of the description flashed across him yes there would be a day when his face would be wrinkled and wizen his eyes dim and colourless the grace of his figure broken and deformed the scarlet would pass away from his lips and the gold steal from his hair the life that was to make his soul would mar his body he would become dreadful hideous and uncouth ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as he thought of it a sharp pang of pain struck through him like a knife and made each delicate fibre of his nature quiver his eyes deepened into amethyst and across them came a mist of tears he felt as if a hand of ice had been laid upon his heart ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
how sad it is murmured dorian gray with his eyes still fixed upon his own portrait how sad it is i shall grow old and horrible and dreadful but this picture will remain always young it will never be older than this particular day of june if it were only the other way if it were i who was to be always young and the picture that was to grow old for thatfor thati would give everything yes there is nothing in the whole world i would not give i would give my soul for that ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes he continued i am less to you than your ivory hermes or your silver faun you will like them always how long will you like me till i have my first wrinkle i suppose i know now that when one loses ones good looks whatever they may be one loses everything your picture has taught me that lord henry wotton is perfectly right youth is the only thing worth having when i find that i am growing old i shall kill myself ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
hallward turned pale and caught his hand dorian dorian he cried dont talk like that i have never had such a friend as you and i shall never have such another you are not jealous of material things are youyou who are finer than any of them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am jealous of everything whose beauty does not die i am jealous of the portrait you have painted of me why should it keep what i must lose every moment that passes takes something from me and gives something to it oh if it were only the other way if the picture could change and i could be always what i am now why did you paint it it will mock me some daymock me horribly the hot tears welled into his eyes he tore his hand away and flinging himself on the divan he buried his face in the cushions as though he was praying ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
harry i cant quarrel with my two best friends at once but between you both you have made me hate the finest piece of work i have ever done and i will destroy it what is it but canvas and colour i will not let it come across our three lives and mar them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray lifted his golden head from the pillow and with pallid face and tearstained eyes looked at him as he walked over to the deal paintingtable that was set beneath the high curtained window what was he doing there his fingers were straying about among the litter of tin tubes and dry brushes seeking for something yes it was for the long paletteknife with its thin blade of lithe steel he had found it at last he was going to rip up the canvas ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
well as soon as you are dry you shall be varnished and framed and sent home then you can do what you like with yourself and he walked across the room and rang the bell for tea you will have tea of course dorian and so will you harry or do you object to such simple pleasures ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i adore simple pleasures said lord henry they are the last refuge of the complex but i dont like scenes except on the stage what absurd fellows you are both of you i wonder who it was defined man as a rational animal it was the most premature definition ever given man is many things but he is not rational i am glad he is not after allthough i wish you chaps would not squabble over the picture you had much better let me have it basil this silly boy doesnt really want it and i really do ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there came a knock at the door and the butler entered with a laden teatray and set it down upon a small japanese table there was a rattle of cups and saucers and the hissing of a fluted georgian urn two globeshaped china dishes were brought in by a page dorian gray went over and poured out the tea the two men sauntered languidly to the table and examined what was under the covers ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
let us go to the theatre tonight said lord henry there is sure to be something on somewhere i have promised to dine at whites but it is only with an old friend so i can send him a wire to say that i am ill or that i am prevented from coming in consequence of a subsequent engagement i think that would be a rather nice excuse it would have all the surprise of candour ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
what a fuss people make about fidelity exclaimed lord henry why even in love it is purely a question for physiology it has nothing to do with our own will young men want to be faithful and are not old men want to be faithless and cannot that is all one can say ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
very well said hallward and he went over and laid down his cup on the tray it is rather late and as you have to dress you had better lose no time goodbye harry goodbye dorian come and see me soon come tomorrow ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at halfpast twelve next day lord henry wotton strolled from curzon street over to the albany to call on his uncle lord fermor a genial if somewhat roughmannered old bachelor whom the outside world called selfish because it derived no particular benefit from him but who was considered generous by society as he fed the people who amused him his father had been our ambassador at madrid when isabella was young and prim unthought of but had retired from the diplomatic service in a capricious moment of annoyance on not being offered the embassy at paris a post to which he considered that he was fully entitled by reason of his birth his indolence the good english of his dispatches and his inordinate passion for pleasure the son who had been his fathers secretary had resigned along with his chief somewhat foolishly as was thought at the time and on succeeding some months later to the title had set himself to the serious study of the great aristocratic art of doing absolutely nothing he had two large town houses but preferred to live in chambers as it was less trouble and took most of his meals at his club he paid some attention to the management of his collieries in the midland counties excusing himself for this taint of industry on the ground that the one advantage of having coal was that it enabled a gentleman to afford the decency of burning wood on his own hearth in politics he was a tory except when the tories were in office during which period he roundly abused them for being a pack of radicals he was a hero to his valet who bullied him and a terror to most of his relations whom he bullied in turn only england could have produced him and he always said that the country was going to the dogs his principles were out of date but there was a good deal to be said for his prejudices ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when lord henry entered the room he found his uncle sitting in a rough shootingcoat smoking a cheroot and grumbling over the times well harry said the old gentleman what brings you out so early i thought you dandies never got up till two and were not visible till five ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes murmured lord henry settling his buttonhole in his coat and when they grow older they know it but i dont want money it is only people who pay their bills who want that uncle george and i never pay mine credit is the capital of a younger son and one lives charmingly upon it besides i always deal with dartmoors tradesmen and consequently they never bother me what i want is information not useful information of course useless information ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
well i can tell you anything that is in an english blue book harry although those fellows nowadays write a lot of nonsense when i was in the diplomatic things were much better but i hear they let them in now by examination what can you expect examinations sir are pure humbug from beginning to end if a man is a gentleman he knows quite enough and if he is not a gentleman whatever he knows is bad for him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
that is what i have come to learn uncle george or rather i know who he is he is the last lord kelsos grandson his mother was a devereux lady margaret devereux i want you to tell me about his mother what was she like whom did she marry you have known nearly everybody in your time so you might have known her i am very much interested in mr gray at present i have only just met him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
kelsos grandson echoed the old gentleman kelsos grandson  of course i knew his mother intimately i believe i was at her christening she was an extraordinarily beautiful girl margaret devereux and made all the men frantic by running away with a penniless young fellowa mere nobody sir a subaltern in a foot regiment or something of that kind certainly i remember the whole thing as if it happened yesterday the poor chap was killed in a duel at spa a few months after the marriage there was an ugly story about it they said kelso got some rascally adventurer some belgian brute to insult his soninlaw in publicpaid him sir to do it paid himand that the fellow spitted his man as if he had been a pigeon the thing was hushed up but egad kelso ate his chop alone at the club for some time afterwards he brought his daughter back with him i was told and she never spoke to him again oh yes it was a bad business the girl died too died within a year so she left a son did she i had forgotten that what sort of boy is he if he is like his mother he must be a goodlooking chap ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i hope he will fall into proper hands continued the old man he should have a pot of money waiting for him if kelso did the right thing by him his mother had money too all the selby property came to her through her grandfather her grandfather hated kelso thought him a mean dog he was too came to madrid once when i was there egad i was ashamed of him the queen used to ask me about the english noble who was always quarrelling with the cabmen about their fares they made quite a story of it i didnt dare show my face at court for a month i hope he treated his grandson better than he did the jarvies ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
margaret devereux was one of the loveliest creatures i ever saw harry what on earth induced her to behave as she did i never could understand she could have married anybody she chose carlington was mad after her she was romantic though all the women of that family were the men were a poor lot but egad the women were wonderful carlington went on his knees to her told me so himself she laughed at him and there wasnt a girl in london at the time who wasnt after him and by the way harry talking about silly marriages what is this humbug your father tells me about dartmoor wanting to marry an american aint english girls good enough for him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it is that is the reason why like eve they are so excessively anxious to get out of it said lord henry goodbye uncle george i shall be late for lunch if i stop any longer thanks for giving me the information i wanted i always like to know everything about my new friends and nothing about my old ones ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
so that was the story of dorian grays parentage crudely as it had been told to him it had yet stirred him by its suggestion of a strange almost modern romance a beautiful woman risking everything for a mad passion a few wild weeks of happiness cut short by a hideous treacherous crime months of voiceless agony and then a child born in pain the mother snatched away by death the boy left to solitude and the tyranny of an old and loveless man yes it was an interesting background it posed the lad made him more perfect as it were behind every exquisite thing that existed there was something tragic worlds had to be in travail that the meanest flower might blow and how charming he had been at dinner the night before as with startled eyes and lips parted in frightened pleasure he had sat opposite to him at the club the red candleshades staining to a richer rose the wakening wonder of his face talking to him was like playing upon an exquisite violin he answered to every touch and thrill of the bow there was something terribly enthralling in the exercise of influence no other activity was like it to project ones soul into some gracious form and let it tarry there for a moment to hear ones own intellectual views echoed back to one with all the added music of passion and youth to convey ones temperament into another as though it were a subtle fluid or a strange perfume there was a real joy in thatperhaps the most satisfying joy left to us in an age so limited and vulgar as our own an age grossly carnal in its pleasures and grossly common in its aims he was a marvellous type too this lad whom by so curious a chance he had met in basils studio or could be fashioned into a marvellous type at any rate grace was his and the white purity of boyhood and beauty such as old greek marbles kept for us there was nothing that one could not do with him he could be made a titan or a toy what a pity it was that such beauty was destined to fade  and basil from a psychological point of view how interesting he was the new manner in art the fresh mode of looking at life suggested so strangely by the merely visible presence of one who was unconscious of it all the silent spirit that dwelt in dim woodland and walked unseen in open field suddenly showing herself dryadlike and not afraid because in his soul who sought for her there had been wakened that wonderful vision to which alone are wonderful things revealed the mere shapes and patterns of things becoming as it were refined and gaining a kind of symbolical value as though they were themselves patterns of some other and more perfect form whose shadow they made real how strange it all was he remembered something like it in history was it not plato that artist in thought who had first analyzed it was it not buonarotti who had carved it in the coloured marbles of a sonnetsequence but in our own century it was strange yes he would try to be to dorian gray what without knowing it the lad was to the painter who had fashioned the wonderful portrait he would seek to dominate himhad already indeed half done so he would make that wonderful spirit his own there was something fascinating in this son of love and death ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
suddenly he stopped and glanced up at the houses he found that he had passed his aunts some distance and smiling to himself turned back when he entered the somewhat sombre hall the butler told him that they had gone in to lunch he gave one of the footmen his hat and stick and passed into the diningroom ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he invented a facile excuse and having taken the vacant seat next to her looked round to see who was there dorian bowed to him shyly from the end of the table a flush of pleasure stealing into his cheek opposite was the duchess of harley a lady of admirable goodnature and good temper much liked by every one who knew her and of those ample architectural proportions that in women who are not duchesses are described by contemporary historians as stoutness next to her sat on her right sir thomas burdon a radical member of parliament who followed his leader in public life and in private life followed the best cooks dining with the tories and thinking with the liberals in accordance with a wise and wellknown rule the post on her left was occupied by mr erskine of treadley an old gentleman of considerable charm and culture who had fallen however into bad habits of silence having as he explained once to lady agatha said everything that he had to say before he was thirty his own neighbour was mrs vandeleur one of his aunts oldest friends a perfect saint amongst women but so dreadfully dowdy that she reminded one of a badly bound hymnbook fortunately for him she had on the other side lord faudel a most intelligent middleaged mediocrity as bald as a ministerial statement in the house of commons with whom she was conversing in that intensely earnest manner which is the one unpardonable error as he remarked once himself that all really good people fall into and from which none of them ever quite escape ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when america was discovered said the radical memberand he began to give some wearisome facts like all people who try to exhaust a subject he exhausted his listeners the duchess sighed and exercised her privilege of interruption i wish to goodness it never had been discovered at all she exclaimed really our girls have no chance nowadays it is most unfair ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh but i have seen specimens of the inhabitants answered the duchess vaguely i must confess that most of them are extremely pretty and they dress well too they get all their dresses in paris i wish i could afford to do the same ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
sir thomas frowned i am afraid that your nephew is prejudiced against that great country he said to lady agatha i have travelled all over it in cars provided by the directors who in such matters are extremely civil i assure you that it is an education to visit it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
sir thomas waved his hand mr erskine of treadley has the world on his shelves we practical men like to see things not to read about them the americans are an extremely interesting people they are absolutely reasonable i think that is their distinguishing characteristic yes mr erskine an absolutely reasonable people i assure you there is no nonsense about the americans ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
was that a paradox asked mr erskine i did not think so perhaps it was well the way of paradoxes is the way of truth to test reality we must see it on the tight rope when the verities become acrobats we can judge them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dear me said lady agatha how you men argue i am sure i never can make out what you are talking about oh harry i am quite vexed with you why do you try to persuade our nice mr dorian gray to give up the east end i assure you he would be quite invaluable they would love his playing ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i can sympathize with everything except suffering said lord henry shrugging his shoulders i cannot sympathize with that it is too ugly too horrible too distressing there is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain one should sympathize with the colour the beauty the joy of life the less said about lifes sores the better ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry laughed i dont desire to change anything in england except the weather he answered i am quite content with philosophic contemplation but as the nineteenth century has gone bankrupt through an overexpenditure of sympathy i would suggest that we should appeal to science to put us straight the advantage of the emotions is that they lead us astray and the advantage of science is that it is not emotional ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you are really very comforting warbled the duchess i have always felt rather guilty when i came to see your dear aunt for i take no interest at all in the east end for the future i shall be able to look her in the face without a blush ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes he continued that is one of the great secrets of life nowadays most people die of a sort of creeping common sense and discover when it is too late that the only things one never regrets are ones mistakes ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he played with the idea and grew wilful tossed it into the air and transformed it let it escape and recaptured it made it iridescent with fancy and winged it with paradox the praise of folly as he went on soared into a philosophy and philosophy herself became young and catching the mad music of pleasure wearing one might fancy her winestained robe and wreath of ivy danced like a bacchante over the hills of life and mocked the slow silenus for being sober facts fled before her like frightened forest things her white feet trod the huge press at which wise omar sits till the seething grapejuice rose round her bare limbs in waves of purple bubbles or crawled in red foam over the vats black dripping sloping sides it was an extraordinary improvisation he felt that the eyes of dorian gray were fixed on him and the consciousness that amongst his audience there was one whose temperament he wished to fascinate seemed to give his wit keenness and to lend colour to his imagination he was brilliant fantastic irresponsible he charmed his listeners out of themselves and they followed his pipe laughing dorian gray never took his gaze off him but sat like one under a spell smiles chasing each other over his lips and wonder growing grave in his darkening eyes ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at last liveried in the costume of the age reality entered the room in the shape of a servant to tell the duchess that her carriage was waiting she wrung her hands in mock despair how annoying she cried i must go i have to call for my husband at the club to take him to some absurd meeting at williss rooms where he is going to be in the chair if i am late he is sure to be furious and i couldnt have a scene in this bonnet it is far too fragile a harsh word would ruin it no i must go dear agatha goodbye lord henry you are quite delightful and dreadfully demoralizing i am sure i dont know what to say about your views you must come and dine with us some night tuesday are you disengaged tuesday ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am too fond of reading books to care to write them mr erskine i should like to write a novel certainly a novel that would be as lovely as a persian carpet and as unreal but there is no literary public in england for anything except newspapers primers and encyclopaedias of all people in the world the english have the least sense of the beauty of literature ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i fear you are right answered mr erskine i myself used to have literary ambitions but i gave them up long ago and now my dear young friend if you will allow me to call you so may i ask if you really meant all that you said to us at lunch ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
very bad indeed in fact i consider you extremely dangerous and if anything happens to our good duchess we shall all look on you as being primarily responsible but i should like to talk to you about life the generation into which i was born was tedious some day when you are tired of london come down to treadley and expound to me your philosophy of pleasure over some admirable burgundy i am fortunate enough to possess ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
one afternoon a month later dorian gray was reclining in a luxurious armchair in the little library of lord henrys house in mayfair it was in its way a very charming room with its high panelled wainscoting of olivestained oak its creamcoloured frieze and ceiling of raised plasterwork and its brickdust felt carpet strewn with silk longfringed persian rugs on a tiny satinwood table stood a statuette by clodion and beside it lay a copy of les cent nouvelles bound for margaret of valois by clovis eve and powdered with the gilt daisies that queen had selected for her device some large blue china jars and parrottulips were ranged on the mantelshelf and through the small leaded panes of the window streamed the apricotcoloured light of a summer day in london ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry had not yet come in he was always late on principle his principle being that punctuality is the thief of time so the lad was looking rather sulky as with listless fingers he turned over the pages of an elaborately illustrated edition of manon lescaut that he had found in one of the bookcases the formal monotonous ticking of the louis quatorze clock annoyed him once or twice he thought of going away ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
well eighteen then and i saw you with him the other night at the opera she laughed nervously as she spoke and watched him with her vague forgetmenot eyes she was a curious woman whose dresses always looked as if they had been designed in a rage and put on in a tempest she was usually in love with somebody and as her passion was never returned she had kept all her illusions she tried to look picturesque but only succeeded in being untidy her name was victoria and she had a perfect mania for going to church ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes it was at dear lohengrin i like wagners music better than anybodys it is so loud that one can talk the whole time without other people hearing what one says that is a great advantage dont you think so mr gray ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
ah that is one of harrys views isnt it mr gray i always hear harrys views from his friends it is the only way i get to know of them but you must not think i dont like good music i adore it but i am afraid of it it makes me too romantic i have simply worshipped pianiststwo at a time sometimes harry tells me i dont know what it is about them perhaps it is that they are foreigners they all are aint they even those that are born in england become foreigners after a time dont they it is so clever of them and such a compliment to art makes it quite cosmopolitan doesnt it you have never been to any of my parties have you mr gray you must come i cant afford orchids but i spare no expense in foreigners they make ones rooms look so picturesque but here is harry harry i came in to look for you to ask you somethingi forget what it wasand i found mr gray here we have had such a pleasant chat about music we have quite the same ideas no i think our ideas are quite different but he has been most pleasant i am so glad ive seen him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am charmed my love quite charmed said lord henry elevating his dark crescentshaped eyebrows and looking at them both with an amused smile so sorry i am late dorian i went to look after a piece of old brocade in wardour street and had to bargain for hours for it nowadays people know the price of everything and the value of nothing ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am afraid i must be going exclaimed lady henry breaking an awkward silence with her silly sudden laugh i have promised to drive with the duchess goodbye mr gray goodbye harry you are dining out i suppose so am i perhaps i shall see you at lady thornburys ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i dare say my dear said lord henry shutting the door behind her as looking like a bird of paradise that had been out all night in the rain she flitted out of the room leaving a faint odour of frangipanni then he lit a cigarette and flung himself down on the sofa ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear boy no woman is a genius women are a decorative sex they never have anything to say but they say it charmingly women represent the triumph of matter over mind just as men represent the triumph of mind over morals ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear dorian it is quite true i am analysing women at present so i ought to know the subject is not so abstruse as i thought it was i find that ultimately there are only two kinds of women the plain and the coloured the plain women are very useful if you want to gain a reputation for respectability you have merely to take them down to supper the other women are very charming they commit one mistake however they paint in order to try and look young our grandmothers painted in order to try and talk brilliantly rouge and esprit used to go together that is all over now as long as a woman can look ten years younger than her own daughter she is perfectly satisfied as for conversation there are only five women in london worth talking to and two of these cant be admitted into decent society however tell me about your genius how long have you known her ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i will tell you harry but you mustnt be unsympathetic about it after all it never would have happened if i had not met you you filled me with a wild desire to know everything about life for days after i met you something seemed to throb in my veins as i lounged in the park or strolled down piccadilly i used to look at every one who passed me and wonder with a mad curiosity what sort of lives they led some of them fascinated me others filled me with terror there was an exquisite poison in the air i had a passion for sensations well one evening about seven oclock i determined to go out in search of some adventure i felt that this grey monstrous london of ours with its myriads of people its sordid sinners and its splendid sins as you once phrased it must have something in store for me i fancied a thousand things the mere danger gave me a sense of delight i remembered what you had said to me on that wonderful evening when we first dined together about the search for beauty being the real secret of life i dont know what i expected but i went out and wandered eastward soon losing my way in a labyrinth of grimy streets and black grassless squares about halfpast eight i passed by an absurd little theatre with great flaring gasjets and gaudy playbills a hideous jew in the most amazing waistcoat i ever beheld in my life was standing at the entrance smoking a vile cigar he had greasy ringlets and an enormous diamond blazed in the centre of a soiled shirt have a box my lord he said when he saw me and he took off his hat with an air of gorgeous servility there was something about him harry that amused me he was such a monster you will laugh at me i know but i really went in and paid a whole guinea for the stagebox to the present day i cant make out why i did so and yet if i hadntmy dear harry if i hadnti should have missed the greatest romance of my life i see you are laughing it is horrid of you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am not laughing dorian at least i am not laughing at you but you should not say the greatest romance of your life you should say the first romance of your life you will always be loved and you will always be in love with love a grande passion is the privilege of people who have nothing to do that is the one use of the idle classes of a country dont be afraid there are exquisite things in store for you this is merely the beginning ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear boy the people who love only once in their lives are really the shallow people what they call their loyalty and their fidelity i call either the lethargy of custom or their lack of imagination faithfulness is to the emotional life what consistency is to the life of the intellectsimply a confession of failure faithfulness i must analyse it some day the passion for property is in it there are many things that we would throw away if we were not afraid that others might pick them up but i dont want to interrupt you go on with your story ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
well i found myself seated in a horrid little private box with a vulgar dropscene staring me in the face i looked out from behind the curtain and surveyed the house it was a tawdry affair all cupids and cornucopias like a thirdrate weddingcake the gallery and pit were fairly full but the two rows of dingy stalls were quite empty and there was hardly a person in what i suppose they called the dresscircle women went about with oranges and gingerbeer and there was a terrible consumption of nuts going on ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i should think the idiot boy or dumb but innocent our fathers used to like that sort of piece i believe the longer i live dorian the more keenly i feel that whatever was good enough for our fathers is not good enough for us in art as in politics les grandpres ont toujours tort ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
this play was good enough for us harry it was romeo and juliet i must admit that i was rather annoyed at the idea of seeing shakespeare done in such a wretched hole of a place still i felt interested in a sort of way at any rate i determined to wait for the first act there was a dreadful orchestra presided over by a young hebrew who sat at a cracked piano that nearly drove me away but at last the dropscene was drawn up and the play began romeo was a stout elderly gentleman with corked eyebrows a husky tragedy voice and a figure like a beerbarrel mercutio was almost as bad he was played by the lowcomedian who had introduced gags of his own and was on most friendly terms with the pit they were both as grotesque as the scenery and that looked as if it had come out of a countrybooth but juliet harry imagine a girl hardly seventeen years of age with a little flowerlike face a small greek head with plaited coils of darkbrown hair eyes that were violet wells of passion lips that were like the petals of a rose she was the loveliest thing i had ever seen in my life you said to me once that pathos left you unmoved but that beauty mere beauty could fill your eyes with tears i tell you harry i could hardly see this girl for the mist of tears that came across me and her voicei never heard such a voice it was very low at first with deep mellow notes that seemed to fall singly upon ones ear then it became a little louder and sounded like a flute or a distant hautboy in the gardenscene it had all the tremulous ecstasy that one hears just before dawn when nightingales are singing there were moments later on when it had the wild passion of violins you know how a voice can stir one your voice and the voice of sibyl vane are two things that i shall never forget when i close my eyes i hear them and each of them says something different i dont know which to follow why should i not love her harry i do love her she is everything to me in life night after night i go to see her play one evening she is rosalind and the next evening she is imogen i have seen her die in the gloom of an italian tomb sucking the poison from her lovers lips i have watched her wandering through the forest of arden disguised as a pretty boy in hose and doublet and dainty cap she has been mad and has come into the presence of a guilty king and given him rue to wear and bitter herbs to taste of she has been innocent and the black hands of jealousy have crushed her reedlike throat i have seen her in every age and in every costume ordinary women never appeal to ones imagination they are limited to their century no glamour ever transfigures them one knows their minds as easily as one knows their bonnets one can always find them there is no mystery in any of them they ride in the park in the morning and chatter at teaparties in the afternoon they have their stereotyped smile and their fashionable manner they are quite obvious but an actress how different an actress is harry why didnt you tell me that the only thing worth loving is an actress ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
people like youthe wilful sunbeams of lifedont commit crimes dorian but i am much obliged for the compliment all the same and now tell mereach me the matches like a good boythankswhat are your actual relations with sibyl vane ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it is only the sacred things that are worth touching dorian said lord henry with a strange touch of pathos in his voice but why should you be annoyed i suppose she will belong to you some day when one is in love one always begins by deceiving ones self and one always ends by deceiving others that is what the world calls a romance you know her at any rate i suppose ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
of course i know her on the first night i was at the theatre the horrid old jew came round to the box after the performance was over and offered to take me behind the scenes and introduce me to her i was furious with him and told him that juliet had been dead for hundreds of years and that her body was lying in a marble tomb in verona i think from his blank look of amazement that he was under the impression that i had taken too much champagne or something ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
then he asked me if i wrote for any of the newspapers i told him i never even read them he seemed terribly disappointed at that and confided to me that all the dramatic critics were in a conspiracy against him and that they were every one of them to be bought ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
well he seemed to think they were beyond his means laughed dorian by this time however the lights were being put out in the theatre and i had to go he wanted me to try some cigars that he strongly recommended i declined the next night of course i arrived at the place again when he saw me he made me a low bow and assured me that i was a munificent patron of art he was a most offensive brute though he had an extraordinary passion for shakespeare he told me once with an air of pride that his five bankruptcies were entirely due to the bard as he insisted on calling him he seemed to think it a distinction ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was a distinction my dear doriana great distinction most people become bankrupt through having invested too heavily in the prose of life to have ruined ones self over poetry is an honour but when did you first speak to miss sibyl vane ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the third night she had been playing rosalind i could not help going round i had thrown her some flowers and she had looked at meat least i fancied that she had the old jew was persistent he seemed determined to take me behind so i consented it was curious my not wanting to know her wasnt it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
sibyl oh she was so shy and so gentle there is something of a child about her her eyes opened wide in exquisite wonder when i told her what i thought of her performance and she seemed quite unconscious of her power i think we were both rather nervous the old jew stood grinning at the doorway of the dusty greenroom making elaborate speeches about us both while we stood looking at each other like children he would insist on calling me my lord so i had to assure sibyl that i was not anything of the kind she said quite simply to me you look more like a prince i must call you prince charming ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you dont understand her harry she regarded me merely as a person in a play she knows nothing of life she lives with her mother a faded tired woman who played lady capulet in a sort of magenta dressingwrapper on the first night and looks as if she had seen better days ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
sibyl is the only thing i care about what is it to me where she came from from her little head to her little feet she is absolutely and entirely divine every night of my life i go to see her act and every night she is more marvellous ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
well i cant help going to see sibyl play he cried even if it is only for a single act i get hungry for her presence and when i think of the wonderful soul that is hidden away in that little ivory body i am filled with awe ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
how horrid you are she is all the great heroines of the world in one she is more than an individual you laugh but i tell you she has genius i love her and i must make her love me you who know all the secrets of life tell me how to charm sibyl vane to love me i want to make romeo jealous i want the dead lovers of the world to hear our laughter and grow sad i want a breath of our passion to stir their dust into consciousness to wake their ashes into pain my god harry how i worship her he was walking up and down the room as he spoke hectic spots of red burned on his cheeks he was terribly excited ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry watched him with a subtle sense of pleasure how different he was now from the shy frightened boy he had met in basil hallwards studio his nature had developed like a flower had borne blossoms of scarlet flame out of its secret hidingplace had crept his soul and desire had come to meet it on the way ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i want you and basil to come with me some night and see her act i have not the slightest fear of the result you are certain to acknowledge her genius then we must get her out of the jews hands she is bound to him for three yearsat least for two years and eight monthsfrom the present time i shall have to pay him something of course when all that is settled i shall take a west end theatre and bring her out properly she will make the world as mad as she has made me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
halfpast six what an hour it will be like having a meattea or reading an english novel it must be seven no gentleman dines before seven shall you see basil between this and then or shall i write to him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dear basil i have not laid eyes on him for a week it is rather horrid of me as he has sent me my portrait in the most wonderful frame specially designed by himself and though i am a little jealous of the picture for being a whole month younger than i am i must admit that i delight in it perhaps you had better write to him i dont want to see him alone he says things that annoy me he gives me good advice ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
basil my dear boy puts everything that is charming in him into his work the consequence is that he has nothing left for life but his prejudices his principles and his common sense the only artists i have ever known who are personally delightful are bad artists good artists exist simply in what they make and consequently are perfectly uninteresting in what they are a great poet a really great poet is the most unpoetical of all creatures but inferior poets are absolutely fascinating the worse their rhymes are the more picturesque they look the mere fact of having published a book of secondrate sonnets makes a man quite irresistible he lives the poetry that he cannot write the others write the poetry that they dare not realize ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i wonder is that really so harry said dorian gray putting some perfume on his handkerchief out of a large goldtopped bottle that stood on the table it must be if you say it and now i am off imogen is waiting for me dont forget about tomorrow goodbye ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as he left the room lord henrys heavy eyelids drooped and he began to think certainly few people had ever interested him so much as dorian gray and yet the lads mad adoration of some one else caused him not the slightest pang of annoyance or jealousy he was pleased by it it made him a more interesting study he had been always enthralled by the methods of natural science but the ordinary subjectmatter of that science had seemed to him trivial and of no import and so he had begun by vivisecting himself as he had ended by vivisecting others human lifethat appeared to him the one thing worth investigating compared to it there was nothing else of any value it was true that as one watched life in its curious crucible of pain and pleasure one could not wear over ones face a mask of glass nor keep the sulphurous fumes from troubling the brain and making the imagination turbid with monstrous fancies and misshapen dreams there were poisons so subtle that to know their properties one had to sicken of them there were maladies so strange that one had to pass through them if one sought to understand their nature and yet what a great reward one received how wonderful the whole world became to one to note the curious hard logic of passion and the emotional coloured life of the intellectto observe where they met and where they separated at what point they were in unison and at what point they were at discordthere was a delight in that what matter what the cost was one could never pay too high a price for any sensation ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he was consciousand the thought brought a gleam of pleasure into his brown agate eyesthat it was through certain words of his musical words said with musical utterance that dorian grays soul had turned to this white girl and bowed in worship before her to a large extent the lad was his own creation he had made him premature that was something ordinary people waited till life disclosed to them its secrets but to the few to the elect the mysteries of life were revealed before the veil was drawn away sometimes this was the effect of art and chiefly of the art of literature which dealt immediately with the passions and the intellect but now and then a complex personality took the place and assumed the office of art was indeed in its way a real work of art life having its elaborate masterpieces just as poetry has or sculpture or painting ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes the lad was premature he was gathering his harvest while it was yet spring the pulse and passion of youth were in him but he was becoming selfconscious it was delightful to watch him with his beautiful face and his beautiful soul he was a thing to wonder at it was no matter how it all ended or was destined to end he was like one of those gracious figures in a pageant or a play whose joys seem to be remote from one but whose sorrows stir ones sense of beauty and whose wounds are like red roses ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
soul and body body and soulhow mysterious they were there was animalism in the soul and the body had its moments of spirituality the senses could refine and the intellect could degrade who could say where the fleshly impulse ceased or the psychical impulse began how shallow were the arbitrary definitions of ordinary psychologists and yet how difficult to decide between the claims of the various schools was the soul a shadow seated in the house of sin or was the body really in the soul as giordano bruno thought the separation of spirit from matter was a mystery and the union of spirit with matter was a mystery also ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he began to wonder whether we could ever make psychology so absolute a science that each little spring of life would be revealed to us as it was we always misunderstood ourselves and rarely understood others experience was of no ethical value it was merely the name men gave to their mistakes moralists had as a rule regarded it as a mode of warning had claimed for it a certain ethical efficacy in the formation of character had praised it as something that taught us what to follow and showed us what to avoid but there was no motive power in experience it was as little of an active cause as conscience itself all that it really demonstrated was that our future would be the same as our past and that the sin we had done once and with loathing we would do many times and with joy ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was clear to him that the experimental method was the only method by which one could arrive at any scientific analysis of the passions and certainly dorian gray was a subject made to his hand and seemed to promise rich and fruitful results his sudden mad love for sibyl vane was a psychological phenomenon of no small interest there was no doubt that curiosity had much to do with it curiosity and the desire for new experiences yet it was not a simple but rather a very complex passion what there was in it of the purely sensuous instinct of boyhood had been transformed by the workings of the imagination changed into something that seemed to the lad himself to be remote from sense and was for that very reason all the more dangerous it was the passions about whose origin we deceived ourselves that tyrannized most strongly over us our weakest motives were those of whose nature we were conscious it often happened that when we thought we were experimenting on others we were really experimenting on ourselves ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
while lord henry sat dreaming on these things a knock came to the door and his valet entered and reminded him it was time to dress for dinner he got up and looked out into the street the sunset had smitten into scarlet gold the upper windows of the houses opposite the panes glowed like plates of heated metal the sky above was like a faded rose he thought of his friends young fierycoloured life and wondered how it was all going to end ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when he arrived home about halfpast twelve oclock he saw a telegram lying on the hall table he opened it and found it was from dorian gray it was to tell him that he was engaged to be married to sibyl vane ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
mother mother i am so happy whispered the girl burying her face in the lap of the faded tiredlooking woman who with back turned to the shrill intrusive light was sitting in the one armchair that their dingy sittingroom contained i am so happy she repeated and you must be happy too ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
mrs vane winced and put her thin bismuthwhitened hands on her daughters head happy she echoed i am only happy sibyl when i see you act you must not think of anything but your acting mr isaacs has been very good to us and we owe him money ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
sibyl vane tossed her head and laughed we dont want him any more mother prince charming rules life for us now then she paused a rose shook in her blood and shadowed her cheeks quick breath parted the petals of her lips they trembled some southern wind of passion swept over her and stirred the dainty folds of her dress i love him she said simply ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the girl laughed again the joy of a caged bird was in her voice her eyes caught the melody and echoed it in radiance then closed for a moment as though to hide their secret when they opened the mist of a dream had passed across them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
thinlipped wisdom spoke at her from the worn chair hinted at prudence quoted from that book of cowardice whose author apes the name of common sense she did not listen she was free in her prison of passion her prince prince charming was with her she had called on memory to remake him she had sent her soul to search for him and it had brought him back his kiss burned again upon her mouth her eyelids were warm with his breath ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
then wisdom altered its method and spoke of espial and discovery this young man might be rich if so marriage should be thought of against the shell of her ear broke the waves of worldly cunning the arrows of craft shot by her she saw the thin lips moving and smiled ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
suddenly she felt the need to speak the wordy silence troubled her mother mother she cried why does he love me so much i know why i love him i love him because he is like what love himself should be but what does he see in me i am not worthy of him and yetwhy i cannot tellthough i feel so much beneath him i dont feel humble i feel proud terribly proud mother did you love my father as i love prince charming ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the elder woman grew pale beneath the coarse powder that daubed her cheeks and her dry lips twitched with a spasm of pain sybil rushed to her flung her arms round her neck and kissed her forgive me mother i know it pains you to talk about our father but it only pains you because you loved him so much dont look so sad i am as happy today as you were twenty years ago ah let me be happy for ever ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my child you are far too young to think of falling in love besides what do you know of this young man you dont even know his name the whole thing is most inconvenient and really when james is going away to australia and i have so much to think of i must say that you should have shown more consideration however as i said before if he is rich  ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
mrs vane glanced at her and with one of those false theatrical gestures that so often become a mode of second nature to a stageplayer clasped her in her arms at this moment the door opened and a young lad with rough brown hair came into the room he was thickset of figure and his hands and feet were large and somewhat clumsy in movement he was not so finely bred as his sister one would hardly have guessed the close relationship that existed between them mrs vane fixed her eyes on him and intensified her smile she mentally elevated her son to the dignity of an audience she felt sure that the tableau was interesting ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my son dont say such dreadful things murmured mrs vane taking up a tawdry theatrical dress with a sigh and beginning to patch it she felt a little disappointed that he had not joined the group it would have increased the theatrical picturesqueness of the situation ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you pain me my son i trust you will return from australia in a position of affluence i believe there is no society of any kind in the coloniesnothing that i would call societyso when you have made your fortune you must come back and assert yourself in london ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh jim said sibyl laughing how unkind of you but are you really going for a walk with me that will be nice i was afraid you were going to say goodbye to some of your friendsto tom hardy who gave you that hideous pipe or ned langton who makes fun of you for smoking it it is very sweet of you to let me have your last afternoon where shall we go let us go to the park ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
quite ready james she answered keeping her eyes on her work for some months past she had felt ill at ease when she was alone with this rough stern son of hers her shallow secret nature was troubled when their eyes met she used to wonder if he suspected anything the silence for he made no other observation became intolerable to her she began to complain women defend themselves by attacking just as they attack by sudden and strange surrenders i hope you will be contented james with your seafaring life she said you must remember that it is your own choice you might have entered a solicitors office solicitors are a very respectable class and in the country often dine with the best families ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you are speaking about things you dont understand james in the profession we are accustomed to receive a great deal of most gratifying attention i myself used to receive many bouquets at one time that was when acting was really understood as for sibyl i do not know at present whether her attachment is serious or not but there is no doubt that the young man in question is a perfect gentleman he is always most polite to me besides he has the appearance of being rich and the flowers he sends are lovely ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my son you distress me very much sibyl is always under my special care of course if this gentleman is wealthy there is no reason why she should not contract an alliance with him i trust he is one of the aristocracy he has all the appearance of it i must say it might be a most brilliant marriage for sibyl they would make a charming couple his good looks are really quite remarkable everybody notices them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
they went out into the flickering windblown sunlight and strolled down the dreary euston road the passersby glanced in wonder at the sullen heavy youth who in coarse illfitting clothes was in the company of such a graceful refinedlooking girl he was like a common gardener walking with a rose ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
jim frowned from time to time when he caught the inquisitive glance of some stranger he had that dislike of being stared at which comes on geniuses late in life and never leaves the commonplace sibyl however was quite unconscious of the effect she was producing her love was trembling in laughter on her lips she was thinking of prince charming and that she might think of him all the more she did not talk of him but prattled on about the ship in which jim was going to sail about the gold he was certain to find about the wonderful heiress whose life he was to save from the wicked redshirted bushrangers for he was not to remain a sailor or a supercargo or whatever he was going to be oh no a sailors existence was dreadful fancy being cooped up in a horrid ship with the hoarse humpbacked waves trying to get in and a black wind blowing the masts down and tearing the sails into long screaming ribands he was to leave the vessel at melbourne bid a polite goodbye to the captain and go off at once to the goldfields before a week was over he was to come across a large nugget of pure gold the largest nugget that had ever been discovered and bring it down to the coast in a waggon guarded by six mounted policemen the bushrangers were to attack them three times and be defeated with immense slaughter or no he was not to go to the goldfields at all they were horrid places where men got intoxicated and shot each other in barrooms and used bad language he was to be a nice sheepfarmer and one evening as he was riding home he was to see the beautiful heiress being carried off by a robber on a black horse and give chase and rescue her of course she would fall in love with him and he with her and they would get married and come home and live in an immense house in london yes there were delightful things in store for him but he must be very good and not lose his temper or spend his money foolishly she was only a year older than he was but she knew so much more of life he must be sure also to write to her by every mail and to say his prayers each night before he went to sleep god was very good and would watch over him she would pray for him too and in a few years he would come back quite rich and happy ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yet it was not this alone that made him gloomy and morose inexperienced though he was he had still a strong sense of the danger of sibyls position this young dandy who was making love to her could mean her no good he was a gentleman and he hated him for that hated him through some curious raceinstinct for which he could not account and which for that reason was all the more dominant within him he was conscious also of the shallowness and vanity of his mothers nature and in that saw infinite peril for sibyl and sibyls happiness children begin by loving their parents as they grow older they judge them sometimes they forgive them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
his mother he had something on his mind to ask of her something that he had brooded on for many months of silence a chance phrase that he had heard at the theatre a whispered sneer that had reached his ears one night as he waited at the stagedoor had set loose a train of horrible thoughts he remembered it as if it had been the lash of a huntingcrop across his face his brows knit together into a wedgelike furrow and with a twitch of pain he bit his underlip ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he is called prince charming dont you like the name oh you silly boy you should never forget it if you only saw him you would think him the most wonderful person in the world some day you will meet himwhen you come back from australia you will like him so much everybody likes him and i  love him i wish you could come to the theatre tonight he is going to be there and i am to play juliet oh how i shall play it fancy jim to be in love and play juliet to have him sitting there to play for his delight i am afraid i may frighten the company frighten or enthrall them to be in love is to surpass ones self poor dreadful mr isaacs will be shouting genius to his loafers at the bar he has preached me as a dogma tonight he will announce me as a revelation i feel it and it is all his his only prince charming my wonderful lover my god of graces but i am poor beside him poor what does that matter when poverty creeps in at the door love flies in through the window our proverbs want rewriting they were made in winter and it is summer now springtime for me i think a very dance of blossoms in blue skies ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she laughed and took his arm you dear old jim you talk as if you were a hundred some day you will be in love yourself then you will know what it is dont look so sulky surely you should be glad to think that though you are going away you leave me happier than i have ever been before life has been hard for us both terribly hard and difficult but it will be different now you are going to a new world and i have found one here are two chairs let us sit down and see the smart people go by ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
they took their seats amidst a crowd of watchers the tulipbeds across the road flamed like throbbing rings of fire a white dusttremulous cloud of orrisroot it seemedhung in the panting air the brightly coloured parasols danced and dipped like monstrous butterflies ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she made her brother talk of himself his hopes his prospects he spoke slowly and with effort they passed words to each other as players at a game pass counters sibyl felt oppressed she could not communicate her joy a faint smile curving that sullen mouth was all the echo she could win after some time she became silent suddenly she caught a glimpse of golden hair and laughing lips and in an open carriage with two ladies dorian gray drove past ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he jumped up and seized her roughly by the arm show him to me which is he point him out i must see him he exclaimed but at that moment the duke of berwicks fourinhand came between and when it had left the space clear the carriage had swept out of the park ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when they reached the achilles statue she turned round there was pity in her eyes that became laughter on her lips she shook her head at him you are foolish jim utterly foolish a badtempered boy that is all how can you say such horrible things you dont know what you are talking about you are simply jealous and unkind ah i wish you would fall in love love makes people good and what you said was wicked ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am sixteen he answered and i know what i am about mother is no help to you she doesnt understand how to look after you i wish now that i was not going to australia at all i have a great mind to chuck the whole thing up i would if my articles hadnt been signed ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh dont be so serious jim you are like one of the heroes of those silly melodramas mother used to be so fond of acting in i am not going to quarrel with you i have seen him and oh to see him is perfect happiness we wont quarrel i know you would never harm any one i love would you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at the marble arch they hailed an omnibus which left them close to their shabby home in the euston road it was after five oclock and sibyl had to lie down for a couple of hours before acting jim insisted that she should do so he said that he would sooner part with her when their mother was not present she would be sure to make a scene and he detested scenes of every kind ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
in sybils own room they parted there was jealousy in the lads heart and a fierce murderous hatred of the stranger who as it seemed to him had come between them yet when her arms were flung round his neck and her fingers strayed through his hair he softened and kissed her with real affection there were tears in his eyes as he went downstairs ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
his mother was waiting for him below she grumbled at his unpunctuality as he entered he made no answer but sat down to his meagre meal the flies buzzed round the table and crawled over the stained cloth through the rumble of omnibuses and the clatter of streetcabs he could hear the droning voice devouring each minute that was left to him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after some time he thrust away his plate and put his head in his hands he felt that he had a right to know it should have been told to him before if it was as he suspected leaden with fear his mother watched him words dropped mechanically from her lips a tattered lace handkerchief twitched in her fingers when the clock struck six he got up and went to the door then he turned back and looked at her their eyes met in hers he saw a wild appeal for mercy it enraged him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she heaved a deep sigh it was a sigh of relief the terrible moment the moment that night and day for weeks and months she had dreaded had come at last and yet she felt no terror indeed in some measure it was a disappointment to her the vulgar directness of the question called for a direct answer the situation had not been gradually led up to it was crude it reminded her of a bad rehearsal ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she shook her head i knew he was not free we loved each other very much if he had lived he would have made provision for us dont speak against him my son he was your father and a gentleman indeed he was highly connected ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the lad was touched he went towards her and stooping down he kissed her i am sorry if i have pained you by asking about my father he said but i could not help it i must go now goodbye dont forget that you will have only one child now to look after and believe me that if this man wrongs my sister i will find out who he is track him down and kill him like a dog i swear it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the exaggerated folly of the threat the passionate gesture that accompanied it the mad melodramatic words made life seem more vivid to her she was familiar with the atmosphere she breathed more freely and for the first time for many months she really admired her son she would have liked to have continued the scene on the same emotional scale but he cut her short trunks had to be carried down and mufflers looked for the lodginghouse drudge bustled in and out there was the bargaining with the cabman the moment was lost in vulgar details it was with a renewed feeling of disappointment that she waved the tattered lace handkerchief from the window as her son drove away she was conscious that a great opportunity had been wasted she consoled herself by telling sibyl how desolate she felt her life would be now that she had only one child to look after she remembered the phrase it had pleased her of the threat she said nothing it was vividly and dramatically expressed she felt that they would all laugh at it some day ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
no harry answered the artist giving his hat and coat to the bowing waiter what is it nothing about politics i hope they dont interest me there is hardly a single person in the house of commons worth painting though many of them would be the better for a little whitewashing ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
except in america rejoined lord henry languidly but i didnt say he was married i said he was engaged to be married there is a great difference i have a distinct remembrance of being married but i have no recollection at all of being engaged i am inclined to think that i never was engaged ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh she is better than goodshe is beautiful murmured lord henry sipping a glass of vermouth and orangebitters dorian says she is beautiful and he is not often wrong about things of that kind your portrait of him has quickened his appreciation of the personal appearance of other people it has had that excellent effect amongst others we are to see her tonight if that boy doesnt forget his appointment ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i never approve or disapprove of anything now it is an absurd attitude to take towards life we are not sent into the world to air our moral prejudices i never take any notice of what common people say and i never interfere with what charming people do if a personality fascinates me whatever mode of expression that personality selects is absolutely delightful to me dorian gray falls in love with a beautiful girl who acts juliet and proposes to marry her why not if he wedded messalina he would be none the less interesting you know i am not a champion of marriage the real drawback to marriage is that it makes one unselfish and unselfish people are colourless they lack individuality still there are certain temperaments that marriage makes more complex they retain their egotism and add to it many other egos they are forced to have more than one life they become more highly organized and to be highly organized is i should fancy the object of mans existence besides every experience is of value and whatever one may say against marriage it is certainly an experience i hope that dorian gray will make this girl his wife passionately adore her for six months and then suddenly become fascinated by some one else he would be a wonderful study ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry laughed the reason we all like to think so well of others is that we are all afraid for ourselves the basis of optimism is sheer terror we think that we are generous because we credit our neighbour with the possession of those virtues that are likely to be a benefit to us we praise the banker that we may overdraw our account and find good qualities in the highwayman in the hope that he may spare our pockets i mean everything that i have said i have the greatest contempt for optimism as for a spoiled life no life is spoiled but one whose growth is arrested if you want to mar a nature you have merely to reform it as for marriage of course that would be silly but there are other and more interesting bonds between men and women i will certainly encourage them they have the charm of being fashionable but here is dorian himself he will tell you more than i can ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear harry my dear basil you must both congratulate me said the lad throwing off his evening cape with its satinlined wings and shaking each of his friends by the hand in turn i have never been so happy of course it is suddenall really delightful things are and yet it seems to me to be the one thing i have been looking for all my life he was flushed with excitement and pleasure and looked extraordinarily handsome ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and i dont forgive you for being late for dinner broke in lord henry putting his hand on the lads shoulder and smiling as he spoke come let us sit down and try what the new chef here is like and then you will tell us how it all came about ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there is really not much to tell cried dorian as they took their seats at the small round table what happened was simply this after i left you yesterday evening harry i dressed had some dinner at that little italian restaurant in rupert street you introduced me to and went down at eight oclock to the theatre sibyl was playing rosalind of course the scenery was dreadful and the orlando absurd but sibyl you should have seen her when she came on in her boys clothes she was perfectly wonderful she wore a mosscoloured velvet jerkin with cinnamon sleeves slim brown crossgartered hose a dainty little green cap with a hawks feather caught in a jewel and a hooded cloak lined with dull red she had never seemed to me more exquisite she had all the delicate grace of that tanagra figurine that you have in your studio basil her hair clustered round her face like dark leaves round a pale rose as for her actingwell you shall see her tonight she is simply a born artist i sat in the dingy box absolutely enthralled i forgot that i was in london and in the nineteenth century i was away with my love in a forest that no man had ever seen after the performance was over i went behind and spoke to her as we were sitting together suddenly there came into her eyes a look that i had never seen there before my lips moved towards hers we kissed each other i cant describe to you what i felt at that moment it seemed to me that all my life had been narrowed to one perfect point of rosecoloured joy she trembled all over and shook like a white narcissus then she flung herself on her knees and kissed my hands i feel that i should not tell you all this but i cant help it of course our engagement is a dead secret she has not even told her own mother i dont know what my guardians will say lord radley is sure to be furious i dont care i shall be of age in less than a year and then i can do what i like i have been right basil havent i to take my love out of poetry and to find my wife in shakespeares plays lips that shakespeare taught to speak have whispered their secret in my ear i have had the arms of rosalind around me and kissed juliet on the mouth ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear harry i did not treat it as a business transaction and i did not make any formal proposal i told her that i loved her and she said she was not worthy to be my wife not worthy why the whole world is nothing to me compared with her ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry looked across the table dorian is never annoyed with me he answered i asked the question for the best reason possible for the only reason indeed that excuses one for asking any questionsimple curiosity i have a theory that it is always the women who propose to us and not we who propose to the women except of course in middleclass life but then the middle classes are not modern ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray laughed and tossed his head you are quite incorrigible harry but i dont mind it is impossible to be angry with you when you see sibyl vane you will feel that the man who could wrong her would be a beast a beast without a heart i cannot understand how any one can wish to shame the thing he loves i love sibyl vane i want to place her on a pedestal of gold and to see the world worship the woman who is mine what is marriage an irrevocable vow you mock at it for that ah dont mock it is an irrevocable vow that i want to take her trust makes me faithful her belief makes me good when i am with her i regret all that you have taught me i become different from what you have known me to be i am changed and the mere touch of sibyl vanes hand makes me forget you and all your wrong fascinating poisonous delightful theories ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
pleasure is the only thing worth having a theory about he answered in his slow melodious voice but i am afraid i cannot claim my theory as my own it belongs to nature not to me pleasure is natures test her sign of approval when we are happy we are always good but when we are good we are not always happy ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
to be good is to be in harmony with ones self he replied touching the thin stem of his glass with his pale finepointed fingers discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others ones own lifethat is the important thing as for the lives of ones neighbours if one wishes to be a prig or a puritan one can flaunt ones moral views about them but they are not ones concern besides individualism has really the higher aim modern morality consists in accepting the standard of ones age i consider that for any man of culture to accept the standard of his age is a form of the grossest immorality ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes we are overcharged for everything nowadays i should fancy that the real tragedy of the poor is that they can afford nothing but selfdenial beautiful sins like beautiful things are the privilege of the rich ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry shrugged his shoulders my dear fellow medival art is charming but medival emotions are out of date one can use them in fiction of course but then the only things that one can use in fiction are the things that one has ceased to use in fact believe me no civilized man ever regrets a pleasure and no uncivilized man ever knows what a pleasure is ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
that is certainly better than being adored he answered toying with some fruits being adored is a nuisance women treat us just as humanity treats its gods they worship us and are always bothering us to do something for them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
possibly he sighed but they invariably want it back in such very small change that is the worry women as some witty frenchman once put it inspire us with the desire to do masterpieces and always prevent us from carrying them out ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you will always like me dorian he replied will you have some coffee you fellows waiter bring coffee and finechampagne and some cigarettes no dont mind the cigarettesi have some basil i cant allow you to smoke cigars you must have a cigarette a cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure it is exquisite and it leaves one unsatisfied what more can one want yes dorian you will always be fond of me i represent to you all the sins you have never had the courage to commit ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
what nonsense you talk harry cried the lad taking a light from a firebreathing silver dragon that the waiter had placed on the table let us go down to the theatre when sibyl comes on the stage you will have a new ideal of life she will represent something to you that you have never known ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i have known everything said lord henry with a tired look in his eyes but i am always ready for a new emotion i am afraid however that for me at any rate there is no such thing still your wonderful girl may thrill me i love acting it is so much more real than life let us go dorian you will come with me i am so sorry basil but there is only room for two in the brougham you must follow us in a hansom ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
they got up and put on their coats sipping their coffee standing the painter was silent and preoccupied there was a gloom over him he could not bear this marriage and yet it seemed to him to be better than many other things that might have happened after a few minutes they all passed downstairs he drove off by himself as had been arranged and watched the flashing lights of the little brougham in front of him a strange sense of loss came over him he felt that dorian gray would never again be to him all that he had been in the past life had come between them his eyes darkened and the crowded flaring streets became blurred to his eyes when the cab drew up at the theatre it seemed to him that he had grown years older ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for some reason or other the house was crowded that night and the fat jew manager who met them at the door was beaming from ear to ear with an oily tremulous smile he escorted them to their box with a sort of pompous humility waving his fat jewelled hands and talking at the top of his voice dorian gray loathed him more than ever he felt as if he had come to look for miranda and had been met by caliban lord henry upon the other hand rather liked him at least he declared he did and insisted on shaking him by the hand and assuring him that he was proud to meet a man who had discovered a real genius and gone bankrupt over a poet hallward amused himself with watching the faces in the pit the heat was terribly oppressive and the huge sunlight flamed like a monstrous dahlia with petals of yellow fire the youths in the gallery had taken off their coats and waistcoats and hung them over the side they talked to each other across the theatre and shared their oranges with the tawdry girls who sat beside them some women were laughing in the pit their voices were horribly shrill and discordant the sound of the popping of corks came from the bar ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes answered dorian gray it was here i found her and she is divine beyond all living things when she acts you will forget everything these common rough people with their coarse faces and brutal gestures become quite different when she is on the stage they sit silently and watch her they weep and laugh as she wills them to do she makes them as responsive as a violin she spiritualizes them and one feels that they are of the same flesh and blood as ones self ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dont pay any attention to him dorian said the painter i understand what you mean and i believe in this girl any one you love must be marvellous and any girl who has the effect you describe must be fine and noble to spiritualize ones agethat is something worth doing if this girl can give a soul to those who have lived without one if she can create the sense of beauty in people whose lives have been sordid and ugly if she can strip them of their selfishness and lend them tears for sorrows that are not their own she is worthy of all your adoration worthy of the adoration of the world this marriage is quite right i did not think so at first but i admit it now the gods made sibyl vane for you without her you would have been incomplete ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
thanks basil answered dorian gray pressing his hand i knew that you would understand me harry is so cynical he terrifies me but here is the orchestra it is quite dreadful but it only lasts for about five minutes then the curtain rises and you will see the girl to whom i am going to give all my life to whom i have given everything that is good in me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a quarter of an hour afterwards amidst an extraordinary turmoil of applause sibyl vane stepped on to the stage yes she was certainly lovely to look atone of the loveliest creatures lord henry thought that he had ever seen there was something of the fawn in her shy grace and startled eyes a faint blush like the shadow of a rose in a mirror of silver came to her cheeks as she glanced at the crowded enthusiastic house she stepped back a few paces and her lips seemed to tremble basil hallward leaped to his feet and began to applaud motionless and as one in a dream sat dorian gray gazing at her lord henry peered through his glasses murmuring charming charming ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the scene was the hall of capulets house and romeo in his pilgrims dress had entered with mercutio and his other friends the band such as it was struck up a few bars of music and the dance began through the crowd of ungainly shabbily dressed actors sibyl vane moved like a creature from a finer world her body swayed while she danced as a plant sways in the water the curves of her throat were the curves of a white lily her hands seemed to be made of cool ivory ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
good pilgrim you do wrong your hand too much which mannerly devotion shows in this for saints have hands that pilgrims hands do touch and palm to palm is holy palmers kiss ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
with the brief dialogue that follows were spoken in a thoroughly artificial manner the voice was exquisite but from the point of view of tone it was absolutely false it was wrong in colour it took away all the life from the verse it made the passion unreal ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she looked charming as she came out in the moonlight that could not be denied but the staginess of her acting was unbearable and grew worse as she went on her gestures became absurdly artificial she overemphasized everything that she had to say the beautiful passage ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
although i joy in thee i have no joy of this contract tonight it is too rash too unadvised too sudden too like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it lightens sweet goodnight this bud of love by summers ripening breath may prove a beauteous flower when next we meet ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
even the common uneducated audience of the pit and gallery lost their interest in the play they got restless and began to talk loudly and to whistle the jew manager who was standing at the back of the dresscircle stamped and swore with rage the only person unmoved was the girl herself ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
they are both simply forms of imitation remarked lord henry but do let us go dorian you must not stay here any longer it is not good for ones morals to see bad acting besides i dont suppose you will want your wife to act so what does it matter if she plays juliet like a wooden doll she is very lovely and if she knows as little about life as she does about acting she will be a delightful experience there are only two kinds of people who are really fascinatingpeople who know absolutely everything and people who know absolutely nothing good heavens my dear boy dont look so tragic the secret of remaining young is never to have an emotion that is unbecoming come to the club with basil and myself we will smoke cigarettes and drink to the beauty of sibyl vane she is beautiful what more can you want ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
go away harry cried the lad i want to be alone basil you must go ah cant you see that my heart is breaking the hot tears came to his eyes his lips trembled and rushing to the back of the box he leaned up against the wall hiding his face in his hands ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a few moments afterwards the footlights flared up and the curtain rose on the third act dorian gray went back to his seat he looked pale and proud and indifferent the play dragged on and seemed interminable half of the audience went out tramping in heavy boots and laughing the whole thing was a fiasco the last act was played to almost empty benches the curtain went down on a titter and some groans ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as soon as it was over dorian gray rushed behind the scenes into the greenroom the girl was standing there alone with a look of triumph on her face her eyes were lit with an exquisite fire there was a radiance about her her parted lips were smiling over some secret of their own ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the girl smiled dorian she answered lingering over his name with longdrawn music in her voice as though it were sweeter than honey to the red petals of her mouth dorian you should have understood but you understand now dont you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian dorian she cried before i knew you acting was the one reality of my life it was only in the theatre that i lived i thought that it was all true i was rosalind one night and portia the other the joy of beatrice was my joy and the sorrows of cordelia were mine also i believed in everything the common people who acted with me seemed to me to be godlike the painted scenes were my world i knew nothing but shadows and i thought them real you cameoh my beautiful loveand you freed my soul from prison you taught me what reality really is tonight for the first time in my life i saw through the hollowness the sham the silliness of the empty pageant in which i had always played tonight for the first time i became conscious that the romeo was hideous and old and painted that the moonlight in the orchard was false that the scenery was vulgar and that the words i had to speak were unreal were not my words were not what i wanted to say you had brought me something higher something of which all art is but a reflection you had made me understand what love really is my love my love prince charming prince of life i have grown sick of shadows you are more to me than all art can ever be what have i to do with the puppets of a play when i came on tonight i could not understand how it was that everything had gone from me i thought that i was going to be wonderful i found that i could do nothing suddenly it dawned on my soul what it all meant the knowledge was exquisite to me i heard them hissing and i smiled what could they know of love such as ours take me away doriantake me away with you where we can be quite alone i hate the stage i might mimic a passion that i do not feel but i cannot mimic one that burns me like fire oh dorian dorian you understand now what it signifies even if i could do it it would be profanation for me to play at being in love you have made me see that ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she looked at him in wonder and laughed he made no answer she came across to him and with her little fingers stroked his hair she knelt down and pressed his hands to her lips he drew them away and a shudder ran through him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
then he leaped up and went to the door yes he cried you have killed my love you used to stir my imagination now you dont even stir my curiosity you simply produce no effect i loved you because you were marvellous because you had genius and intellect because you realized the dreams of great poets and gave shape and substance to the shadows of art you have thrown it all away you are shallow and stupid my god how mad i was to love you what a fool i have been you are nothing to me now i will never see you again i will never think of you i will never mention your name you dont know what you were to me once why once  oh i cant bear to think of it i wish i had never laid eyes upon you you have spoiled the romance of my life how little you can know of love if you say it mars your art without your art you are nothing i would have made you famous splendid magnificent the world would have worshipped you and you would have borne my name what are you now a thirdrate actress with a pretty face ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a low moan broke from her and she flung herself at his feet and lay there like a trampled flower dorian dorian dont leave me she whispered i am so sorry i didnt act well i was thinking of you all the time but i will tryindeed i will try it came so suddenly across me my love for you i think i should never have known it if you had not kissed meif we had not kissed each other kiss me again my love dont go away from me i couldnt bear it oh dont go away from me my brother  no never mind he didnt mean it he was in jest but you oh cant you forgive me for tonight i will work so hard and try to improve dont be cruel to me because i love you better than anything in the world after all it is only once that i have not pleased you but you are quite right dorian i should have shown myself more of an artist it was foolish of me and yet i couldnt help it oh dont leave me dont leave me a fit of passionate sobbing choked her she crouched on the floor like a wounded thing and dorian gray with his beautiful eyes looked down at her and his chiselled lips curled in exquisite disdain there is always something ridiculous about the emotions of people whom one has ceased to love sibyl vane seemed to him to be absurdly melodramatic her tears and sobs annoyed him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she wept silently and made no answer but crept nearer her little hands stretched blindly out and appeared to be seeking for him he turned on his heel and left the room in a few moments he was out of the theatre ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
where he went to he hardly knew he remembered wandering through dimly lit streets past gaunt blackshadowed archways and evillooking houses women with hoarse voices and harsh laughter had called after him drunkards had reeled by cursing and chattering to themselves like monstrous apes he had seen grotesque children huddled upon doorsteps and heard shrieks and oaths from gloomy courts ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as the dawn was just breaking he found himself close to covent garden the darkness lifted and flushed with faint fires the sky hollowed itself into a perfect pearl huge carts filled with nodding lilies rumbled slowly down the polished empty street the air was heavy with the perfume of the flowers and their beauty seemed to bring him an anodyne for his pain he followed into the market and watched the men unloading their waggons a whitesmocked carter offered him some cherries he thanked him wondered why he refused to accept any money for them and began to eat them listlessly they had been plucked at midnight and the coldness of the moon had entered into them a long line of boys carrying crates of striped tulips and of yellow and red roses defiled in front of him threading their way through the huge jadegreen piles of vegetables under the portico with its grey sunbleached pillars loitered a troop of draggled bareheaded girls waiting for the auction to be over others crowded round the swinging doors of the coffeehouse in the piazza the heavy carthorses slipped and stamped upon the rough stones shaking their bells and trappings some of the drivers were lying asleep on a pile of sacks irisnecked and pinkfooted the pigeons ran about picking up seeds ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after a little while he hailed a hansom and drove home for a few moments he loitered upon the doorstep looking round at the silent square with its blank closeshuttered windows and its staring blinds the sky was pure opal now and the roofs of the houses glistened like silver against it from some chimney opposite a thin wreath of smoke was rising it curled a violet riband through the nacrecoloured air ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
in the huge gilt venetian lantern spoil of some doges barge that hung from the ceiling of the great oakpanelled hall of entrance lights were still burning from three flickering jets thin blue petals of flame they seemed rimmed with white fire he turned them out and having thrown his hat and cape on the table passed through the library towards the door of his bedroom a large octagonal chamber on the ground floor that in his newborn feeling for luxury he had just had decorated for himself and hung with some curious renaissance tapestries that had been discovered stored in a disused attic at selby royal as he was turning the handle of the door his eye fell upon the portrait basil hallward had painted of him he started back as if in surprise then he went on into his own room looking somewhat puzzled after he had taken the buttonhole out of his coat he seemed to hesitate finally he came back went over to the picture and examined it in the dim arrested light that struggled through the creamcoloured silk blinds the face appeared to him to be a little changed the expression looked different one would have said that there was a touch of cruelty in the mouth it was certainly strange ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he turned round and walking to the window drew up the blind the bright dawn flooded the room and swept the fantastic shadows into dusky corners where they lay shuddering but the strange expression that he had noticed in the face of the portrait seemed to linger there to be more intensified even the quivering ardent sunlight showed him the lines of cruelty round the mouth as clearly as if he had been looking into a mirror after he had done some dreadful thing ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he winced and taking up from the table an oval glass framed in ivory cupids one of lord henrys many presents to him glanced hurriedly into its polished depths no line like that warped his red lips what did it mean ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he rubbed his eyes and came close to the picture and examined it again there were no signs of any change when he looked into the actual painting and yet there was no doubt that the whole expression had altered it was not a mere fancy of his own the thing was horribly apparent ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he threw himself into a chair and began to think suddenly there flashed across his mind what he had said in basil hallwards studio the day the picture had been finished yes he remembered it perfectly he had uttered a mad wish that he himself might remain young and the portrait grow old that his own beauty might be untarnished and the face on the canvas bear the burden of his passions and his sins that the painted image might be seared with the lines of suffering and thought and that he might keep all the delicate bloom and loveliness of his then just conscious boyhood surely his wish had not been fulfilled such things were impossible it seemed monstrous even to think of them and yet there was the picture before him with the touch of cruelty in the mouth ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
cruelty had he been cruel it was the girls fault not his he had dreamed of her as a great artist had given his love to her because he had thought her great then she had disappointed him she had been shallow and unworthy and yet a feeling of infinite regret came over him as he thought of her lying at his feet sobbing like a little child he remembered with what callousness he had watched her why had he been made like that why had such a soul been given to him but he had suffered also during the three terrible hours that the play had lasted he had lived centuries of pain aeon upon aeon of torture his life was well worth hers she had marred him for a moment if he had wounded her for an age besides women were better suited to bear sorrow than men they lived on their emotions they only thought of their emotions when they took lovers it was merely to have some one with whom they could have scenes lord henry had told him that and lord henry knew what women were why should he trouble about sibyl vane she was nothing to him now ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
but the picture what was he to say of that it held the secret of his life and told his story it had taught him to love his own beauty would it teach him to loathe his own soul would he ever look at it again ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
no it was merely an illusion wrought on the troubled senses the horrible night that he had passed had left phantoms behind it suddenly there had fallen upon his brain that tiny scarlet speck that makes men mad the picture had not changed it was folly to think so ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yet it was watching him with its beautiful marred face and its cruel smile its bright hair gleamed in the early sunlight its blue eyes met his own a sense of infinite pity not for himself but for the painted image of himself came over him it had altered already and would alter more its gold would wither into grey its red and white roses would die for every sin that he committed a stain would fleck and wreck its fairness but he would not sin the picture changed or unchanged would be to him the visible emblem of conscience he would resist temptation he would not see lord henry any morewould not at any rate listen to those subtle poisonous theories that in basil hallwards garden had first stirred within him the passion for impossible things he would go back to sibyl vane make her amends marry her try to love her again yes it was his duty to do so she must have suffered more than he had poor child he had been selfish and cruel to her the fascination that she had exercised over him would return they would be happy together his life with her would be beautiful and pure ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he got up from his chair and drew a large screen right in front of the portrait shuddering as he glanced at it how horrible he murmured to himself and he walked across to the window and opened it when he stepped out on to the grass he drew a deep breath the fresh morning air seemed to drive away all his sombre passions he thought only of sibyl a faint echo of his love came back to him he repeated her name over and over again the birds that were singing in the dewdrenched garden seemed to be telling the flowers about her ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was long past noon when he awoke his valet had crept several times on tiptoe into the room to see if he was stirring and had wondered what made his young master sleep so late finally his bell sounded and victor came in softly with a cup of tea and a pile of letters on a small tray of old sevres china and drew back the olivesatin curtains with their shimmering blue lining that hung in front of the three tall windows ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
how late it was he sat up and having sipped some tea turned over his letters one of them was from lord henry and had been brought by hand that morning he hesitated for a moment and then put it aside the others he opened listlessly they contained the usual collection of cards invitations to dinner tickets for private views programmes of charity concerts and the like that are showered on fashionable young men every morning during the season there was a rather heavy bill for a chased silver louisquinze toiletset that he had not yet had the courage to send on to his guardians who were extremely oldfashioned people and did not realize that we live in an age when unnecessary things are our only necessities and there were several very courteously worded communications from jermyn street moneylenders offering to advance any sum of money at a moments notice and at the most reasonable rates of interest ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after about ten minutes he got up and throwing on an elaborate dressinggown of silkembroidered cashmere wool passed into the onyxpaved bathroom the cool water refreshed him after his long sleep he seemed to have forgotten all that he had gone through a dim sense of having taken part in some strange tragedy came to him once or twice but there was the unreality of a dream about it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as soon as he was dressed he went into the library and sat down to a light french breakfast that had been laid out for him on a small round table close to the open window it was an exquisite day the warm air seemed laden with spices a bee flew in and buzzed round the bluedragon bowl that filled with sulphuryellow roses stood before him he felt perfectly happy ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
was it all true had the portrait really changed or had it been simply his own imagination that had made him see a look of evil where there had been a look of joy surely a painted canvas could not alter the thing was absurd it would serve as a tale to tell basil some day it would make him smile ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and yet how vivid was his recollection of the whole thing first in the dim twilight and then in the bright dawn he had seen the touch of cruelty round the warped lips he almost dreaded his valet leaving the room he knew that when he was alone he would have to examine the portrait he was afraid of certainty when the coffee and cigarettes had been brought and the man turned to go he felt a wild desire to tell him to remain as the door was closing behind him he called him back the man stood waiting for his orders dorian looked at him for a moment i am not at home to any one victor he said with a sigh the man bowed and retired ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
then he rose from the table lit a cigarette and flung himself down on a luxuriously cushioned couch that stood facing the screen the screen was an old one of gilt spanish leather stamped and wrought with a rather florid louisquatorze pattern he scanned it curiously wondering if ever before it had concealed the secret of a mans life ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
should he move it aside after all why not let it stay there what was the use of knowing if the thing was true it was terrible if it was not true why trouble about it but what if by some fate or deadlier chance eyes other than his spied behind and saw the horrible change what should he do if basil hallward came and asked to look at his own picture basil would be sure to do that no the thing had to be examined and at once anything would be better than this dreadful state of doubt ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he got up and locked both doors at least he would be alone when he looked upon the mask of his shame then he drew the screen aside and saw himself face to face it was perfectly true the portrait had altered ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as he often remembered afterwards and always with no small wonder he found himself at first gazing at the portrait with a feeling of almost scientific interest that such a change should have taken place was incredible to him and yet it was a fact was there some subtle affinity between the chemical atoms that shaped themselves into form and colour on the canvas and the soul that was within him could it be that what that soul thought they realizedthat what it dreamed they made true or was there some other more terrible reason he shuddered and felt afraid and going back to the couch lay there gazing at the picture in sickened horror ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
one thing however he felt that it had done for him it had made him conscious how unjust how cruel he had been to sibyl vane it was not too late to make reparation for that she could still be his wife his unreal and selfish love would yield to some higher influence would be transformed into some nobler passion and the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him would be a guide to him through life would be to him what holiness is to some and conscience to others and the fear of god to us all there were opiates for remorse drugs that could lull the moral sense to sleep but here was a visible symbol of the degradation of sin here was an everpresent sign of the ruin men brought upon their souls ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
three oclock struck and four and the halfhour rang its double chime but dorian gray did not stir he was trying to gather up the scarlet threads of life and to weave them into a pattern to find his way through the sanguine labyrinth of passion through which he was wandering he did not know what to do or what to think finally he went over to the table and wrote a passionate letter to the girl he had loved imploring her forgiveness and accusing himself of madness he covered page after page with wild words of sorrow and wilder words of pain there is a luxury in selfreproach when we blame ourselves we feel that no one else has a right to blame us it is the confession not the priest that gives us absolution when dorian had finished the letter he felt that he had been forgiven ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he made no answer at first but remained quite still the knocking still continued and grew louder yes it was better to let lord henry in and to explain to him the new life he was going to lead to quarrel with him if it became necessary to quarrel to part if parting was inevitable he jumped up drew the screen hastily across the picture and unlocked the door ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes of course answered lord henry sinking into a chair and slowly pulling off his yellow gloves it is dreadful from one point of view but it was not your fault tell me did you go behind and see her after the play was over ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i have got through all that said dorian shaking his head and smiling i am perfectly happy now i know what conscience is to begin with it is not what you told me it was it is the divinest thing in us dont sneer at it harry any moreat least not before me i want to be good i cant bear the idea of my soul being hideous ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes harry i know what you are going to say something dreadful about marriage dont say it dont ever say things of that kind to me again two days ago i asked sibyl to marry me i am not going to break my word to her she is to be my wife ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry walked across the room and sitting down by dorian gray took both his hands in his own and held them tightly dorian he said my letterdont be frightenedwas to tell you that sibyl vane is dead ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it is quite true dorian said lord henry gravely it is in all the morning papers i wrote down to you to ask you not to see any one till i came there will have to be an inquest of course and you must not be mixed up in it things like that make a man fashionable in paris but in london people are so prejudiced here one should never make ones dbut with a scandal one should reserve that to give an interest to ones old age i suppose they dont know your name at the theatre if they dont it is all right did any one see you going round to her room that is an important point ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian did not answer for a few moments he was dazed with horror finally he stammered in a stifled voice harry did you say an inquest what did you mean by that did sibyl oh harry i cant bear it but be quick tell me everything at once ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i have no doubt it was not an accident dorian though it must be put in that way to the public it seems that as she was leaving the theatre with her mother about halfpast twelve or so she said she had forgotten something upstairs they waited some time for her but she did not come down again they ultimately found her lying dead on the floor of her dressingroom she had swallowed something by mistake some dreadful thing they use at theatres i dont know what it was but it had either prussic acid or white lead in it i should fancy it was prussic acid as she seems to have died instantaneously ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes it is very tragic of course but you must not get yourself mixed up in it i see by the standard that she was seventeen i should have thought she was almost younger than that she looked such a child and seemed to know so little about acting dorian you mustnt let this thing get on your nerves you must come and dine with me and afterwards we will look in at the opera it is a patti night and everybody will be there you can come to my sisters box she has got some smart women with her ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
so i have murdered sibyl vane said dorian gray half to himself murdered her as surely as if i had cut her little throat with a knife yet the roses are not less lovely for all that the birds sing just as happily in my garden and tonight i am to dine with you and then go on to the opera and sup somewhere i suppose afterwards how extraordinarily dramatic life is if i had read all this in a book harry i think i would have wept over it somehow now that it has happened actually and to me it seems far too wonderful for tears here is the first passionate loveletter i have ever written in my life strange that my first passionate loveletter should have been addressed to a dead girl can they feel i wonder those white silent people we call the dead sibyl can she feel or know or listen oh harry how i loved her once it seems years ago to me now she was everything to me then came that dreadful nightwas it really only last nightwhen she played so badly and my heart almost broke she explained it all to me it was terribly pathetic but i was not moved a bit i thought her shallow suddenly something happened that made me afraid i cant tell you what it was but it was terrible i said i would go back to her i felt i had done wrong and now she is dead my god my god harry what shall i do you dont know the danger i am in and there is nothing to keep me straight she would have done that for me she had no right to kill herself it was selfish of her ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear dorian answered lord henry taking a cigarette from his case and producing a goldlatten matchbox the only way a woman can ever reform a man is by boring him so completely that he loses all possible interest in life if you had married this girl you would have been wretched of course you would have treated her kindly one can always be kind to people about whom one cares nothing but she would have soon found out that you were absolutely indifferent to her and when a woman finds that out about her husband she either becomes dreadfully dowdy or wears very smart bonnets that some other womans husband has to pay for i say nothing about the social mistake which would have been abjectwhich of course i would not have allowedbut i assure you that in any case the whole thing would have been an absolute failure ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i suppose it would muttered the lad walking up and down the room and looking horribly pale but i thought it was my duty it is not my fault that this terrible tragedy has prevented my doing what was right i remember your saying once that there is a fatality about good resolutionsthat they are always made too late mine certainly were ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
good resolutions are useless attempts to interfere with scientific laws their origin is pure vanity their result is absolutely nil they give us now and then some of those luxurious sterile emotions that have a certain charm for the weak that is all that can be said for them they are simply cheques that men draw on a bank where they have no account ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the lad frowned i dont like that explanation harry he rejoined but i am glad you dont think i am heartless i am nothing of the kind i know i am not and yet i must admit that this thing that has happened does not affect me as it should it seems to me to be simply like a wonderful ending to a wonderful play it has all the terrible beauty of a greek tragedy a tragedy in which i took a great part but by which i have not been wounded ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it is an interesting question said lord henry who found an exquisite pleasure in playing on the lads unconscious egotism an extremely interesting question i fancy that the true explanation is this it often happens that the real tragedies of life occur in such an inartistic manner that they hurt us by their crude violence their absolute incoherence their absurd want of meaning their entire lack of style they affect us just as vulgarity affects us they give us an impression of sheer brute force and we revolt against that sometimes however a tragedy that possesses artistic elements of beauty crosses our lives if these elements of beauty are real the whole thing simply appeals to our sense of dramatic effect suddenly we find that we are no longer the actors but the spectators of the play or rather we are both we watch ourselves and the mere wonder of the spectacle enthralls us in the present case what is it that has really happened some one has killed herself for love of you i wish that i had ever had such an experience it would have made me in love with love for the rest of my life the people who have adored methere have not been very many but there have been somehave always insisted on living on long after i had ceased to care for them or they to care for me they have become stout and tedious and when i meet them they go in at once for reminiscences that awful memory of woman what a fearful thing it is and what an utter intellectual stagnation it reveals one should absorb the colour of life but one should never remember its details details are always vulgar ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there is no necessity rejoined his companion life has always poppies in her hands of course now and then things linger i once wore nothing but violets all through one season as a form of artistic mourning for a romance that would not die ultimately however it did die i forget what killed it i think it was her proposing to sacrifice the whole world for me that is always a dreadful moment it fills one with the terror of eternity wellwould you believe ita week ago at lady hampshires i found myself seated at dinner next the lady in question and she insisted on going over the whole thing again and digging up the past and raking up the future i had buried my romance in a bed of asphodel she dragged it out again and assured me that i had spoiled her life i am bound to state that she ate an enormous dinner so i did not feel any anxiety but what a lack of taste she showed the one charm of the past is that it is the past but women never know when the curtain has fallen they always want a sixth act and as soon as the interest of the play is entirely over they propose to continue it if they were allowed their own way every comedy would have a tragic ending and every tragedy would culminate in a farce they are charmingly artificial but they have no sense of art you are more fortunate than i am i assure you dorian that not one of the women i have known would have done for me what sibyl vane did for you ordinary women always console themselves some of them do it by going in for sentimental colours never trust a woman who wears mauve whatever her age may be or a woman over thirtyfive who is fond of pink ribbons it always means that they have a history others find a great consolation in suddenly discovering the good qualities of their husbands they flaunt their conjugal felicity in ones face as if it were the most fascinating of sins religion consoles some its mysteries have all the charm of a flirtation a woman once told me and i can quite understand it besides nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner conscience makes egotists of us all yes there is really no end to the consolations that women find in modern life indeed i have not mentioned the most important one ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh the obvious consolation taking some one elses admirer when one loses ones own in good society that always whitewashes a woman but really dorian how different sibyl vane must have been from all the women one meets there is something to me quite beautiful about her death i am glad i am living in a century when such wonders happen they make one believe in the reality of the things we all play with such as romance passion and love ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am afraid that women appreciate cruelty downright cruelty more than anything else they have wonderfully primitive instincts we have emancipated them but they remain slaves looking for their masters all the same they love being dominated i am sure you were splendid i have never seen you really and absolutely angry but i can fancy how delightful you looked and after all you said something to me the day before yesterday that seemed to me at the time to be merely fanciful but that i see now was absolutely true and it holds the key to everything ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
no she will never come to life she has played her last part but you must think of that lonely death in the tawdry dressingroom simply as a strange lurid fragment from some jacobean tragedy as a wonderful scene from webster or ford or cyril tourneur the girl never really lived and so she has never really died to you at least she was always a dream a phantom that flitted through shakespeares plays and left them lovelier for its presence a reed through which shakespeares music sounded richer and more full of joy the moment she touched actual life she marred it and it marred her and so she passed away mourn for ophelia if you like put ashes on your head because cordelia was strangled cry out against heaven because the daughter of brabantio died but dont waste your tears over sibyl vane she was less real than they are ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after some time dorian gray looked up you have explained me to myself harry he murmured with something of a sigh of relief i felt all that you have said but somehow i was afraid of it and i could not express it to myself how well you know me but we will not talk again of what has happened it has been a marvellous experience that is all i wonder if life has still in store for me anything as marvellous ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
ah then said lord henry rising to go then my dear dorian you would have to fight for your victories as it is they are brought to you no you must keep your good looks we live in an age that reads too much to be wise and that thinks too much to be beautiful we cannot spare you and now you had better dress and drive down to the club we are rather late as it is ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as he closed the door behind him dorian gray touched the bell and in a few minutes victor appeared with the lamps and drew the blinds down he waited impatiently for him to go the man seemed to take an interminable time over everything ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as soon as he had left he rushed to the screen and drew it back no there was no further change in the picture it had received the news of sibyl vanes death before he had known of it himself it was conscious of the events of life as they occurred the vicious cruelty that marred the fine lines of the mouth had no doubt appeared at the very moment that the girl had drunk the poison whatever it was or was it indifferent to results did it merely take cognizance of what passed within the soul he wondered and hoped that some day he would see the change taking place before his very eyes shuddering as he hoped it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
poor sibyl what a romance it had all been she had often mimicked death on the stage then death himself had touched her and taken her with him how had she played that dreadful last scene had she cursed him as she died no she had died for love of him and love would always be a sacrament to him now she had atoned for everything by the sacrifice she had made of her life he would not think any more of what she had made him go through on that horrible night at the theatre when he thought of her it would be as a wonderful tragic figure sent on to the worlds stage to show the supreme reality of love a wonderful tragic figure tears came to his eyes as he remembered her childlike look and winsome fanciful ways and shy tremulous grace he brushed them away hastily and looked again at the picture ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he felt that the time had really come for making his choice or had his choice already been made yes life had decided that for himlife and his own infinite curiosity about life eternal youth infinite passion pleasures subtle and secret wild joys and wilder sinshe was to have all these things the portrait was to bear the burden of his shame that was all ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a feeling of pain crept over him as he thought of the desecration that was in store for the fair face on the canvas once in boyish mockery of narcissus he had kissed or feigned to kiss those painted lips that now smiled so cruelly at him morning after morning he had sat before the portrait wondering at its beauty almost enamoured of it as it seemed to him at times was it to alter now with every mood to which he yielded was it to become a monstrous and loathsome thing to be hidden away in a locked room to be shut out from the sunlight that had so often touched to brighter gold the waving wonder of its hair the pity of it the pity of it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for a moment he thought of praying that the horrible sympathy that existed between him and the picture might cease it had changed in answer to a prayer perhaps in answer to a prayer it might remain unchanged and yet who that knew anything about life would surrender the chance of remaining always young however fantastic that chance might be or with what fateful consequences it might be fraught besides was it really under his control had it indeed been prayer that had produced the substitution might there not be some curious scientific reason for it all if thought could exercise its influence upon a living organism might not thought exercise an influence upon dead and inorganic things nay without thought or conscious desire might not things external to ourselves vibrate in unison with our moods and passions atom calling to atom in secret love or strange affinity but the reason was of no importance he would never again tempt by a prayer any terrible power if the picture was to alter it was to alter that was all why inquire too closely into it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for there would be a real pleasure in watching it he would be able to follow his mind into its secret places this portrait would be to him the most magical of mirrors as it had revealed to him his own body so it would reveal to him his own soul and when winter came upon it he would still be standing where spring trembles on the verge of summer when the blood crept from its face and left behind a pallid mask of chalk with leaden eyes he would keep the glamour of boyhood not one blossom of his loveliness would ever fade not one pulse of his life would ever weaken like the gods of the greeks he would be strong and fleet and joyous what did it matter what happened to the coloured image on the canvas he would be safe that was everything ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he drew the screen back into its former place in front of the picture smiling as he did so and passed into his bedroom where his valet was already waiting for him an hour later he was at the opera and lord henry was leaning over his chair ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am so glad i have found you dorian he said gravely i called last night and they told me you were at the opera of course i knew that was impossible but i wish you had left word where you had really gone to i passed a dreadful evening half afraid that one tragedy might be followed by another i think you might have telegraphed for me when you heard of it first i read of it quite by chance in a late edition of the globe that i picked up at the club i came here at once and was miserable at not finding you i cant tell you how heartbroken i am about the whole thing i know what you must suffer but where were you did you go down and see the girls mother for a moment i thought of following you there they gave the address in the paper somewhere in the euston road isnt it but i was afraid of intruding upon a sorrow that i could not lighten poor woman what a state she must be in and her only child too what did she say about it all ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear basil how do i know murmured dorian gray sipping some paleyellow wine from a delicate goldbeaded bubble of venetian glass and looking dreadfully bored i was at the opera you should have come on there i met lady gwendolen harrys sister for the first time we were in her box she is perfectly charming and patti sang divinely dont talk about horrid subjects if one doesnt talk about a thing it has never happened it is simply expression as harry says that gives reality to things i may mention that she was not the womans only child there is a son a charming fellow i believe but he is not on the stage he is a sailor or something and now tell me about yourself and what you are painting ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you went to the opera said hallward speaking very slowly and with a strained touch of pain in his voice you went to the opera while sibyl vane was lying dead in some sordid lodging you can talk to me of other women being charming and of patti singing divinely before the girl you loved has even the quiet of a grave to sleep in why man there are horrors in store for that little white body of hers ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
what has the actual lapse of time got to do with it it is only shallow people who require years to get rid of an emotion a man who is master of himself can end a sorrow as easily as he can invent a pleasure i dont want to be at the mercy of my emotions i want to use them to enjoy them and to dominate them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian this is horrible something has changed you completely you look exactly the same wonderful boy who day after day used to come down to my studio to sit for his picture but you were simple natural and affectionate then you were the most unspoiled creature in the whole world now i dont know what has come over you you talk as if you had no heart no pity in you it is all harrys influence i see that ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the lad flushed up and going to the window looked out for a few moments on the green flickering sunlashed garden i owe a great deal to harry basil he said at last more than i owe to you you only taught me to be vain ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
no said dorian gray there is nothing fearful about it it is one of the great romantic tragedies of the age as a rule people who act lead the most commonplace lives they are good husbands or faithful wives or something tedious you know what i meanmiddleclass virtue and all that kind of thing how different sibyl was she lived her finest tragedy she was always a heroine the last night she playedthe night you saw hershe acted badly because she had known the reality of love when she knew its unreality she died as juliet might have died she passed again into the sphere of art there is something of the martyr about her her death has all the pathetic uselessness of martyrdom all its wasted beauty but as i was saying you must not think i have not suffered if you had come in yesterday at a particular momentabout halfpast five perhaps or a quarter to sixyou would have found me in tears even harry who was here who brought me the news in fact had no idea what i was going through i suffered immensely then it passed away i cannot repeat an emotion no one can except sentimentalists and you are awfully unjust basil you come down here to console me that is charming of you you find me consoled and you are furious how like a sympathetic person you remind me of a story harry told me about a certain philanthropist who spent twenty years of his life in trying to get some grievance redressed or some unjust law alteredi forget exactly what it was finally he succeeded and nothing could exceed his disappointment he had absolutely nothing to do almost died of ennui and became a confirmed misanthrope and besides my dear old basil if you really want to console me teach me rather to forget what has happened or to see it from a proper artistic point of view was it not gautier who used to write about la consolation des arts i remember picking up a little vellumcovered book in your studio one day and chancing on that delightful phrase well i am not like that young man you told me of when we were down at marlow together the young man who used to say that yellow satin could console one for all the miseries of life i love beautiful things that one can touch and handle old brocades green bronzes lacquerwork carved ivories exquisite surroundings luxury pompthere is much to be got from all these but the artistic temperament that they create or at any rate reveal is still more to me to become the spectator of ones own life as harry says is to escape the suffering of life i know you are surprised at my talking to you like this you have not realized how i have developed i was a schoolboy when you knew me i am a man now i have new passions new thoughts new ideas i am different but you must not like me less i am changed but you must always be my friend of course i am very fond of harry but i know that you are better than he is you are not strongeryou are too much afraid of lifebut you are better and how happy we used to be together dont leave me basil and dont quarrel with me i am what i am there is nothing more to be said ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the painter felt strangely moved the lad was infinitely dear to him and his personality had been the great turning point in his art he could not bear the idea of reproaching him any more after all his indifference was probably merely a mood that would pass away there was so much in him that was good so much in him that was noble ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
well dorian he said at length with a sad smile i wont speak to you again about this horrible thing after today i only trust your name wont be mentioned in connection with it the inquest is to take place this afternoon have they summoned you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian shook his head and a look of annoyance passed over his face at the mention of the word inquest there was something so crude and vulgar about everything of the kind they dont know my name he answered ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
only my christian name and that i am quite sure she never mentioned to any one she told me once that they were all rather curious to learn who i was and that she invariably told them my name was prince charming it was pretty of her you must do me a drawing of sibyl basil i should like to have something more of her than the memory of a few kisses and some broken pathetic words ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the painter stared at him my dear boy what nonsense he cried do you mean to say you dont like what i did of you where is it why have you pulled the screen in front of it let me look at it it is the best thing i have ever done do take the screen away dorian it is simply disgraceful of your servant hiding my work like that i felt the room looked different as i came in ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
if you try to look at it basil on my word of honour i will never speak to you again as long as i live i am quite serious i dont offer any explanation and you are not to ask for any but remember if you touch this screen everything is over between us ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
hallward was thunderstruck he looked at dorian gray in absolute amazement he had never seen him like this before the lad was actually pallid with rage his hands were clenched and the pupils of his eyes were like disks of blue fire he was trembling all over ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
but what is the matter of course i wont look at it if you dont want me to he said rather coldly turning on his heel and going over towards the window but really it seems rather absurd that i shouldnt see my own work especially as i am going to exhibit it in paris in the autumn i shall probably have to give it another coat of varnish before that so i must see it some day and why not today ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
to exhibit it you want to exhibit it exclaimed dorian gray a strange sense of terror creeping over him was the world going to be shown his secret were people to gape at the mystery of his life that was impossible somethinghe did not know whathad to be done at once ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes i dont suppose you will object to that georges petit is going to collect all my best pictures for a special exhibition in the rue de sze which will open the first week in october the portrait will only be away a month i should think you could easily spare it for that time in fact you are sure to be out of town and if you keep it always behind a screen you cant care much about it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray passed his hand over his forehead there were beads of perspiration there he felt that he was on the brink of a horrible danger you told me a month ago that you would never exhibit it he cried why have you changed your mind you people who go in for being consistent have just as many moods as others have the only difference is that your moods are rather meaningless you cant have forgotten that you assured me most solemnly that nothing in the world would induce you to send it to any exhibition you told harry exactly the same thing he stopped suddenly and a gleam of light came into his eyes he remembered that lord henry had said to him once half seriously and half in jest if you want to have a strange quarter of an hour get basil to tell you why he wont exhibit your picture he told me why he wouldnt and it was a revelation to me yes perhaps basil too had his secret he would ask him and try ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
basil he said coming over quite close and looking him straight in the face we have each of us a secret let me know yours and i shall tell you mine what was your reason for refusing to exhibit my picture ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the painter shuddered in spite of himself dorian if i told you you might like me less than you do and you would certainly laugh at me i could not bear your doing either of those two things if you wish me never to look at your picture again i am content i have always you to look at if you wish the best work i have ever done to be hidden from the world i am satisfied your friendship is dearer to me than any fame or reputation ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
no basil you must tell me insisted dorian gray i think i have a right to know his feeling of terror had passed away and curiosity had taken its place he was determined to find out basil hallwards mystery ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
let us sit down dorian said the painter looking troubled let us sit down and just answer me one question have you noticed in the picture something curioussomething that probably at first did not strike you but that revealed itself to you suddenly ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i see you did dont speak wait till you hear what i have to say dorian from the moment i met you your personality had the most extraordinary influence over me i was dominated soul brain and power by you you became to me the visible incarnation of that unseen ideal whose memory haunts us artists like an exquisite dream i worshipped you i grew jealous of every one to whom you spoke i wanted to have you all to myself i was only happy when i was with you when you were away from me you were still present in my art of course i never let you know anything about this it would have been impossible you would not have understood it i hardly understood it myself i only knew that i had seen perfection face to face and that the world had become wonderful to my eyestoo wonderful perhaps for in such mad worships there is peril the peril of losing them no less than the peril of keeping them weeks and weeks went on and i grew more and more absorbed in you then came a new development i had drawn you as paris in dainty armour and as adonis with huntsmans cloak and polished boarspear crowned with heavy lotusblossoms you had sat on the prow of adrians barge gazing across the green turbid nile you had leaned over the still pool of some greek woodland and seen in the waters silent silver the marvel of your own face and it had all been what art should beunconscious ideal and remote one day a fatal day i sometimes think i determined to paint a wonderful portrait of you as you actually are not in the costume of dead ages but in your own dress and in your own time whether it was the realism of the method or the mere wonder of your own personality thus directly presented to me without mist or veil i cannot tell but i know that as i worked at it every flake and film of colour seemed to me to reveal my secret i grew afraid that others would know of my idolatry i felt dorian that i had told too much that i had put too much of myself into it then it was that i resolved never to allow the picture to be exhibited you were a little annoyed but then you did not realize all that it meant to me harry to whom i talked about it laughed at me but i did not mind that when the picture was finished and i sat alone with it i felt that i was right well after a few days the thing left my studio and as soon as i had got rid of the intolerable fascination of its presence it seemed to me that i had been foolish in imagining that i had seen anything in it more than that you were extremely goodlooking and that i could paint even now i cannot help feeling that it is a mistake to think that the passion one feels in creation is ever really shown in the work one creates art is always more abstract than we fancy form and colour tell us of form and colourthat is all it often seems to me that art conceals the artist far more completely than it ever reveals him and so when i got this offer from paris i determined to make your portrait the principal thing in my exhibition it never occurred to me that you would refuse i see now that you were right the picture cannot be shown you must not be angry with me dorian for what i have told you as i said to harry once you are made to be worshipped ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray drew a long breath the colour came back to his cheeks and a smile played about his lips the peril was over he was safe for the time yet he could not help feeling infinite pity for the painter who had just made this strange confession to him and wondered if he himself would ever be so dominated by the personality of a friend lord henry had the charm of being very dangerous but that was all he was too clever and too cynical to be really fond of would there ever be some one who would fill him with a strange idolatry was that one of the things that life had in store ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
well perhaps you are right and now goodbye dorian you have been the one person in my life who has really influenced my art whatever i have done that is good i owe to you ah you dont know what it cost me to tell you all that i have told you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh harry cried the lad with a ripple of laughter harry spends his days in saying what is incredible and his evenings in doing what is improbable just the sort of life i would like to lead but still i dont think i would go to harry if i were in trouble i would sooner go to you basil ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
pleasanter for you i am afraid murmured hallward regretfully and now goodbye i am sorry you wont let me look at the picture once again but that cant be helped i quite understand what you feel about it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as he left the room dorian gray smiled to himself poor basil how little he knew of the true reason and how strange it was that instead of having been forced to reveal his own secret he had succeeded almost by chance in wresting a secret from his friend how much that strange confession explained to him the painters absurd fits of jealousy his wild devotion his extravagant panegyrics his curious reticenceshe understood them all now and he felt sorry there seemed to him to be something tragic in a friendship so coloured by romance ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he sighed and touched the bell the portrait must be hidden away at all costs he could not run such a risk of discovery again it had been mad of him to have allowed the thing to remain even for an hour in a room to which any of his friends had access ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when his servant entered he looked at him steadfastly and wondered if he had thought of peering behind the screen the man was quite impassive and waited for his orders dorian lit a cigarette and walked over to the glass and glanced into it he could see the reflection of victors face perfectly it was like a placid mask of servility there was nothing to be afraid of there yet he thought it best to be on his guard ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
speaking very slowly he told him to tell the housekeeper that he wanted to see her and then to go to the framemaker and ask him to send two of his men round at once it seemed to him that as the man left the room his eyes wandered in the direction of the screen or was that merely his own fancy ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and here is the key sir said the old lady going over the contents of her bunch with tremulously uncertain hands here is the key ill have it off the bunch in a moment but you dont think of living up there sir and you so comfortable here ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as the door closed dorian put the key in his pocket and looked round the room his eye fell on a large purple satin coverlet heavily embroidered with gold a splendid piece of late seventeenthcentury venetian work that his grandfather had found in a convent near bologna yes that would serve to wrap the dreadful thing in it had perhaps served often as a pall for the dead now it was to hide something that had a corruption of its own worse than the corruption of death itselfsomething that would breed horrors and yet would never die what the worm was to the corpse his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas they would mar its beauty and eat away its grace they would defile it and make it shameful and yet the thing would still live on it would be always alive ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he shuddered and for a moment he regretted that he had not told basil the true reason why he had wished to hide the picture away basil would have helped him to resist lord henrys influence and the still more poisonous influences that came from his own temperament the love that he bore himfor it was really lovehad nothing in it that was not noble and intellectual it was not that mere physical admiration of beauty that is born of the senses and that dies when the senses tire it was such love as michelangelo had known and montaigne and winckelmann and shakespeare himself yes basil could have saved him but it was too late now the past could always be annihilated regret denial or forgetfulness could do that but the future was inevitable there were passions in him that would find their terrible outlet dreams that would make the shadow of their evil real ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he took up from the couch the great purpleandgold texture that covered it and holding it in his hands passed behind the screen was the face on the canvas viler than before it seemed to him that it was unchanged and yet his loathing of it was intensified gold hair blue eyes and rosered lipsthey all were there it was simply the expression that had altered that was horrible in its cruelty compared to what he saw in it of censure or rebuke how shallow basils reproaches about sibyl vane had beenhow shallow and of what little account his own soul was looking out at him from the canvas and calling him to judgement a look of pain came across him and he flung the rich pall over the picture as he did so a knock came to the door he passed out as his servant entered ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he felt that the man must be got rid of at once he must not be allowed to know where the picture was being taken to there was something sly about him and he had thoughtful treacherous eyes sitting down at the writingtable he scribbled a note to lord henry asking him to send him round something to read and reminding him that they were to meet at eightfifteen that evening ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
in two or three minutes there was another knock and mr hubbard himself the celebrated framemaker of south audley street came in with a somewhat roughlooking young assistant mr hubbard was a florid redwhiskered little man whose admiration for art was considerably tempered by the inveterate impecuniosity of most of the artists who dealt with him as a rule he never left his shop he waited for people to come to him but he always made an exception in favour of dorian gray there was something about dorian that charmed everybody it was a pleasure even to see him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
what can i do for you mr gray he said rubbing his fat freckled hands i thought i would do myself the honour of coming round in person i have just got a beauty of a frame sir picked it up at a sale old florentine came from fonthill i believe admirably suited for a religious subject mr gray ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am so sorry you have given yourself the trouble of coming round mr hubbard i shall certainly drop in and look at the framethough i dont go in much at present for religious artbut today i only want a picture carried to the top of the house for me it is rather heavy so i thought i would ask you to lend me a couple of your men ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there will be no difficulty sir said the genial framemaker beginning with the aid of his assistant to unhook the picture from the long brass chains by which it was suspended and now where shall we carry it to mr gray ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he held the door open for them and they passed out into the hall and began the ascent the elaborate character of the frame had made the picture extremely bulky and now and then in spite of the obsequious protests of mr hubbard who had the true tradesmans spirited dislike of seeing a gentleman doing anything useful dorian put his hand to it so as to help them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he had not entered the place for more than four yearsnot indeed since he had used it first as a playroom when he was a child and then as a study when he grew somewhat older it was a large wellproportioned room which had been specially built by the last lord kelso for the use of the little grandson whom for his strange likeness to his mother and also for other reasons he had always hated and desired to keep at a distance it appeared to dorian to have but little changed there was the huge italian cassone with its fantastically painted panels and its tarnished gilt mouldings in which he had so often hidden himself as a boy there the satinwood bookcase filled with his dogeared schoolbooks on the wall behind it was hanging the same ragged flemish tapestry where a faded king and queen were playing chess in a garden while a company of hawkers rode by carrying hooded birds on their gauntleted wrists how well he remembered it all every moment of his lonely childhood came back to him as he looked round he recalled the stainless purity of his boyish life and it seemed horrible to him that it was here the fatal portrait was to be hidden away how little he had thought in those dead days of all that was in store for him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
but there was no other place in the house so secure from prying eyes as this he had the key and no one else could enter it beneath its purple pall the face painted on the canvas could grow bestial sodden and unclean what did it matter no one could see it he himself would not see it why should he watch the hideous corruption of his soul he kept his youththat was enough and besides might not his nature grow finer after all there was no reason that the future should be so full of shame some love might come across his life and purify him and shield him from those sins that seemed to be already stirring in spirit and in fleshthose curious unpictured sins whose very mystery lent them their subtlety and their charm perhaps some day the cruel look would have passed away from the scarlet sensitive mouth and he might show to the world basil hallwards masterpiece ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
no that was impossible hour by hour and week by week the thing upon the canvas was growing old it might escape the hideousness of sin but the hideousness of age was in store for it the cheeks would become hollow or flaccid yellow crows feet would creep round the fading eyes and make them horrible the hair would lose its brightness the mouth would gape or droop would be foolish or gross as the mouths of old men are there would be the wrinkled throat the cold blueveined hands the twisted body that he remembered in the grandfather who had been so stern to him in his boyhood the picture had to be concealed there was no help for it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian started it would not interest you mr hubbard he said keeping his eye on the man he felt ready to leap upon him and fling him to the ground if he dared to lift the gorgeous hanging that concealed the secret of his life i shant trouble you any more now i am much obliged for your kindness in coming round ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
not at all not at all mr gray ever ready to do anything for you sir and mr hubbard tramped downstairs followed by the assistant who glanced back at dorian with a look of shy wonder in his rough uncomely face he had never seen any one so marvellous ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
on reaching the library he found that it was just after five oclock and that the tea had been already brought up on a little table of dark perfumed wood thickly incrusted with nacre a present from lady radley his guardians wife a pretty professional invalid who had spent the preceding winter in cairo was lying a note from lord henry and beside it was a book bound in yellow paper the cover slightly torn and the edges soiled a copy of the third edition of the st jamess gazette had been placed on the teatray it was evident that victor had returned he wondered if he had met the men in the hall as they were leaving the house and had wormed out of them what they had been doing he would be sure to miss the picturehad no doubt missed it already while he had been laying the teathings the screen had not been set back and a blank space was visible on the wall perhaps some night he might find him creeping upstairs and trying to force the door of the room it was a horrible thing to have a spy in ones house he had heard of rich men who had been blackmailed all their lives by some servant who had read a letter or overheard a conversation or picked up a card with an address or found beneath a pillow a withered flower or a shred of crumpled lace ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he sighed and having poured himself out some tea opened lord henrys note it was simply to say that he sent him round the evening paper and a book that might interest him and that he would be at the club at eightfifteen he opened the st jamess languidly and looked through it a red pencilmark on the fifth page caught his eye it drew attention to the following paragraph ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
inquest on an actressan inquest was held this morning at the bell tavern hoxton road by mr danby the district coroner on the body of sibyl vane a young actress recently engaged at the royal theatre holborn a verdict of death by misadventure was returned considerable sympathy was expressed for the mother of the deceased who was greatly affected during the giving of her own evidence and that of dr birrell who had made the postmortem examination of the deceased ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he frowned and tearing the paper in two went across the room and flung the pieces away how ugly it all was and how horribly real ugliness made things he felt a little annoyed with lord henry for having sent him the report and it was certainly stupid of him to have marked it with red pencil victor might have read it the man knew more than enough english for that ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
his eye fell on the yellow book that lord henry had sent him what was it he wondered he went towards the little pearlcoloured octagonal stand that had always looked to him like the work of some strange egyptian bees that wrought in silver and taking up the volume flung himself into an armchair and began to turn over the leaves after a few minutes he became absorbed it was the strangest book that he had ever read it seemed to him that in exquisite raiment and to the delicate sound of flutes the sins of the world were passing in dumb show before him things that he had dimly dreamed of were suddenly made real to him things of which he had never dreamed were gradually revealed ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was a novel without a plot and with only one character being indeed simply a psychological study of a certain young parisian who spent his life trying to realize in the nineteenth century all the passions and modes of thought that belonged to every century except his own and to sum up as it were in himself the various moods through which the worldspirit had ever passed loving for their mere artificiality those renunciations that men have unwisely called virtue as much as those natural rebellions that wise men still call sin the style in which it was written was that curious jewelled style vivid and obscure at once full of argot and of archaisms of technical expressions and of elaborate paraphrases that characterizes the work of some of the finest artists of the french school of symbolistes there were in it metaphors as monstrous as orchids and as subtle in colour the life of the senses was described in the terms of mystical philosophy one hardly knew at times whether one was reading the spiritual ecstasies of some medival saint or the morbid confessions of a modern sinner it was a poisonous book the heavy odour of incense seemed to cling about its pages and to trouble the brain the mere cadence of the sentences the subtle monotony of their music so full as it was of complex refrains and movements elaborately repeated produced in the mind of the lad as he passed from chapter to chapter a form of reverie a malady of dreaming that made him unconscious of the falling day and creeping shadows ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
cloudless and pierced by one solitary star a coppergreen sky gleamed through the windows he read on by its wan light till he could read no more then after his valet had reminded him several times of the lateness of the hour he got up and going into the next room placed the book on the little florentine table that always stood at his bedside and began to dress for dinner ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for years dorian gray could not free himself from the influence of this book or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that he never sought to free himself from it he procured from paris no less than nine largepaper copies of the first edition and had them bound in different colours so that they might suit his various moods and the changing fancies of a nature over which he seemed at times to have almost entirely lost control the hero the wonderful young parisian in whom the romantic and the scientific temperaments were so strangely blended became to him a kind of prefiguring type of himself and indeed the whole book seemed to him to contain the story of his own life written before he had lived it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
in one point he was more fortunate than the novels fantastic hero he never knewnever indeed had any cause to knowthat somewhat grotesque dread of mirrors and polished metal surfaces and still water which came upon the young parisian so early in his life and was occasioned by the sudden decay of a beau that had once apparently been so remarkable it was with an almost cruel joyand perhaps in nearly every joy as certainly in every pleasure cruelty has its placethat he used to read the latter part of the book with its really tragic if somewhat overemphasized account of the sorrow and despair of one who had himself lost what in others and the world he had most dearly valued ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for the wonderful beauty that had so fascinated basil hallward and many others besides him seemed never to leave him even those who had heard the most evil things against himand from time to time strange rumours about his mode of life crept through london and became the chatter of the clubscould not believe anything to his dishonour when they saw him he had always the look of one who had kept himself unspotted from the world men who talked grossly became silent when dorian gray entered the room there was something in the purity of his face that rebuked them his mere presence seemed to recall to them the memory of the innocence that they had tarnished they wondered how one so charming and graceful as he was could have escaped the stain of an age that was at once sordid and sensual ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
often on returning home from one of those mysterious and prolonged absences that gave rise to such strange conjecture among those who were his friends or thought that they were so he himself would creep upstairs to the locked room open the door with the key that never left him now and stand with a mirror in front of the portrait that basil hallward had painted of him looking now at the evil and aging face on the canvas and now at the fair young face that laughed back at him from the polished glass the very sharpness of the contrast used to quicken his sense of pleasure he grew more and more enamoured of his own beauty more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul he would examine with minute care and sometimes with a monstrous and terrible delight the hideous lines that seared the wrinkling forehead or crawled around the heavy sensual mouth wondering sometimes which were the more horrible the signs of sin or the signs of age he would place his white hands beside the coarse bloated hands of the picture and smile he mocked the misshapen body and the failing limbs ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there were moments indeed at night when lying sleepless in his own delicately scented chamber or in the sordid room of the little illfamed tavern near the docks which under an assumed name and in disguise it was his habit to frequent he would think of the ruin he had brought upon his soul with a pity that was all the more poignant because it was purely selfish but moments such as these were rare that curiosity about life which lord henry had first stirred in him as they sat together in the garden of their friend seemed to increase with gratification the more he knew the more he desired to know he had mad hungers that grew more ravenous as he fed them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yet he was not really reckless at any rate in his relations to society once or twice every month during the winter and on each wednesday evening while the season lasted he would throw open to the world his beautiful house and have the most celebrated musicians of the day to charm his guests with the wonders of their art his little dinners in the settling of which lord henry always assisted him were noted as much for the careful selection and placing of those invited as for the exquisite taste shown in the decoration of the table with its subtle symphonic arrangements of exotic flowers and embroidered cloths and antique plate of gold and silver indeed there were many especially among the very young men who saw or fancied that they saw in dorian gray the true realization of a type of which they had often dreamed in eton or oxford days a type that was to combine something of the real culture of the scholar with all the grace and distinction and perfect manner of a citizen of the world to them he seemed to be of the company of those whom dante describes as having sought to make themselves perfect by the worship of beauty like gautier he was one for whom the visible world existed ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and certainly to him life itself was the first the greatest of the arts and for it all the other arts seemed to be but a preparation fashion by which what is really fantastic becomes for a moment universal and dandyism which in its own way is an attempt to assert the absolute modernity of beauty had of course their fascination for him his mode of dressing and the particular styles that from time to time he affected had their marked influence on the young exquisites of the mayfair balls and pall mall club windows who copied him in everything that he did and tried to reproduce the accidental charm of his graceful though to him only halfserious fopperies ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for while he was but too ready to accept the position that was almost immediately offered to him on his coming of age and found indeed a subtle pleasure in the thought that he might really become to the london of his own day what to imperial neronian rome the author of the satyricon once had been yet in his inmost heart he desired to be something more than a mere arbiter elegantiarum to be consulted on the wearing of a jewel or the knotting of a necktie or the conduct of a cane he sought to elaborate some new scheme of life that would have its reasoned philosophy and its ordered principles and find in the spiritualizing of the senses its highest realization ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the worship of the senses has often and with much justice been decried men feeling a natural instinct of terror about passions and sensations that seem stronger than themselves and that they are conscious of sharing with the less highly organized forms of existence but it appeared to dorian gray that the true nature of the senses had never been understood and that they had remained savage and animal merely because the world had sought to starve them into submission or to kill them by pain instead of aiming at making them elements of a new spirituality of which a fine instinct for beauty was to be the dominant characteristic as he looked back upon man moving through history he was haunted by a feeling of loss so much had been surrendered and to such little purpose there had been mad wilful rejections monstrous forms of selftorture and selfdenial whose origin was fear and whose result was a degradation infinitely more terrible than that fancied degradation from which in their ignorance they had sought to escape nature in her wonderful irony driving out the anchorite to feed with the wild animals of the desert and giving to the hermit the beasts of the field as his companions ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes there was to be as lord henry had prophesied a new hedonism that was to recreate life and to save it from that harsh uncomely puritanism that is having in our own day its curious revival it was to have its service of the intellect certainly yet it was never to accept any theory or system that would involve the sacrifice of any mode of passionate experience its aim indeed was to be experience itself and not the fruits of experience sweet or bitter as they might be of the asceticism that deadens the senses as of the vulgar profligacy that dulls them it was to know nothing but it was to teach man to concentrate himself upon the moments of a life that is itself but a moment ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there are few of us who have not sometimes wakened before dawn either after one of those dreamless nights that make us almost enamoured of death or one of those nights of horror and misshapen joy when through the chambers of the brain sweep phantoms more terrible than reality itself and instinct with that vivid life that lurks in all grotesques and that lends to gothic art its enduring vitality this art being one might fancy especially the art of those whose minds have been troubled with the malady of reverie gradually white fingers creep through the curtains and they appear to tremble in black fantastic shapes dumb shadows crawl into the corners of the room and crouch there outside there is the stirring of birds among the leaves or the sound of men going forth to their work or the sigh and sob of the wind coming down from the hills and wandering round the silent house as though it feared to wake the sleepers and yet must needs call forth sleep from her purple cave veil after veil of thin dusky gauze is lifted and by degrees the forms and colours of things are restored to them and we watch the dawn remaking the world in its antique pattern the wan mirrors get back their mimic life the flameless tapers stand where we had left them and beside them lies the halfcut book that we had been studying or the wired flower that we had worn at the ball or the letter that we had been afraid to read or that we had read too often nothing seems to us changed out of the unreal shadows of the night comes back the real life that we had known we have to resume it where we had left off and there steals over us a terrible sense of the necessity for the continuance of energy in the same wearisome round of stereotyped habits or a wild longing it may be that our eyelids might open some morning upon a world that had been refashioned anew in the darkness for our pleasure a world in which things would have fresh shapes and colours and be changed or have other secrets a world in which the past would have little or no place or survive at any rate in no conscious form of obligation or regret the remembrance even of joy having its bitterness and the memories of pleasure their pain ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was the creation of such worlds as these that seemed to dorian gray to be the true object or amongst the true objects of life and in his search for sensations that would be at once new and delightful and possess that element of strangeness that is so essential to romance he would often adopt certain modes of thought that he knew to be really alien to his nature abandon himself to their subtle influences and then having as it were caught their colour and satisfied his intellectual curiosity leave them with that curious indifference that is not incompatible with a real ardour of temperament and that indeed according to certain modern psychologists is often a condition of it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was rumoured of him once that he was about to join the roman catholic communion and certainly the roman ritual had always a great attraction for him the daily sacrifice more awful really than all the sacrifices of the antique world stirred him as much by its superb rejection of the evidence of the senses as by the primitive simplicity of its elements and the eternal pathos of the human tragedy that it sought to symbolize he loved to kneel down on the cold marble pavement and watch the priest in his stiff flowered dalmatic slowly and with white hands moving aside the veil of the tabernacle or raising aloft the jewelled lanternshaped monstrance with that pallid wafer that at times one would fain think is indeed the panis clestis the bread of angels or robed in the garments of the passion of christ breaking the host into the chalice and smiting his breast for his sins the fuming censers that the grave boys in their lace and scarlet tossed into the air like great gilt flowers had their subtle fascination for him as he passed out he used to look with wonder at the black confessionals and long to sit in the dim shadow of one of them and listen to men and women whispering through the worn grating the true story of their lives ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
but he never fell into the error of arresting his intellectual development by any formal acceptance of creed or system or of mistaking for a house in which to live an inn that is but suitable for the sojourn of a night or for a few hours of a night in which there are no stars and the moon is in travail mysticism with its marvellous power of making common things strange to us and the subtle antinomianism that always seems to accompany it moved him for a season and for a season he inclined to the materialistic doctrines of the darwinismus movement in germany and found a curious pleasure in tracing the thoughts and passions of men to some pearly cell in the brain or some white nerve in the body delighting in the conception of the absolute dependence of the spirit on certain physical conditions morbid or healthy normal or diseased yet as has been said of him before no theory of life seemed to him to be of any importance compared with life itself he felt keenly conscious of how barren all intellectual speculation is when separated from action and experiment he knew that the senses no less than the soul have their spiritual mysteries to reveal ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and so he would now study perfumes and the secrets of their manufacture distilling heavily scented oils and burning odorous gums from the east he saw that there was no mood of the mind that had not its counterpart in the sensuous life and set himself to discover their true relations wondering what there was in frankincense that made one mystical and in ambergris that stirred ones passions and in violets that woke the memory of dead romances and in musk that troubled the brain and in champak that stained the imagination and seeking often to elaborate a real psychology of perfumes and to estimate the several influences of sweetsmelling roots and scented pollenladen flowers of aromatic balms and of dark and fragrant woods of spikenard that sickens of hovenia that makes men mad and of aloes that are said to be able to expel melancholy from the soul ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at another time he devoted himself entirely to music and in a long latticed room with a vermilionandgold ceiling and walls of olivegreen lacquer he used to give curious concerts in which mad gipsies tore wild music from little zithers or grave yellowshawled tunisians plucked at the strained strings of monstrous lutes while grinning negroes beat monotonously upon copper drums and crouching upon scarlet mats slim turbaned indians blew through long pipes of reed or brass and charmedor feigned to charmgreat hooded snakes and horrible horned adders the harsh intervals and shrill discords of barbaric music stirred him at times when schuberts grace and chopins beautiful sorrows and the mighty harmonies of beethoven himself fell unheeded on his ear he collected together from all parts of the world the strangest instruments that could be found either in the tombs of dead nations or among the few savage tribes that have survived contact with western civilizations and loved to touch and try them he had the mysterious juruparis of the rio negro indians that women are not allowed to look at and that even youths may not see till they have been subjected to fasting and scourging and the earthen jars of the peruvians that have the shrill cries of birds and flutes of human bones such as alfonso de ovalle heard in chile and the sonorous green jaspers that are found near cuzco and give forth a note of singular sweetness he had painted gourds filled with pebbles that rattled when they were shaken the long clarin of the mexicans into which the performer does not blow but through which he inhales the air the harsh ture of the amazon tribes that is sounded by the sentinels who sit all day long in high trees and can be heard it is said at a distance of three leagues the teponaztli that has two vibrating tongues of wood and is beaten with sticks that are smeared with an elastic gum obtained from the milky juice of plants the yotlbells of the aztecs that are hung in clusters like grapes and a huge cylindrical drum covered with the skins of great serpents like the one that bernal diaz saw when he went with cortes into the mexican temple and of whose doleful sound he has left us so vivid a description the fantastic character of these instruments fascinated him and he felt a curious delight in the thought that art like nature has her monsters things of bestial shape and with hideous voices yet after some time he wearied of them and would sit in his box at the opera either alone or with lord henry listening in rapt pleasure to tannhauser and seeing in the prelude to that great work of art a presentation of the tragedy of his own soul ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
on one occasion he took up the study of jewels and appeared at a costume ball as anne de joyeuse admiral of france in a dress covered with five hundred and sixty pearls this taste enthralled him for years and indeed may be said never to have left him he would often spend a whole day settling and resettling in their cases the various stones that he had collected such as the olivegreen chrysoberyl that turns red by lamplight the cymophane with its wirelike line of silver the pistachiocoloured peridot rosepink and wineyellow topazes carbuncles of fiery scarlet with tremulous fourrayed stars flamered cinnamonstones orange and violet spinels and amethysts with their alternate layers of ruby and sapphire he loved the red gold of the sunstone and the moonstones pearly whiteness and the broken rainbow of the milky opal he procured from amsterdam three emeralds of extraordinary size and richness of colour and had a turquoise de la vieille roche that was the envy of all the connoisseurs ,The Picture of Dorian Gray

then he turned his attention to embroideries and to the tapestries that performed the office of frescoes in the chill rooms of the northern nations of europe as he investigated the subjectand he always had an extraordinary faculty of becoming absolutely absorbed for the moment in whatever he took uphe was almost saddened by the reflection of the ruin that time brought on beautiful and wonderful things he at any rate had escaped that summer followed summer and the yellow jonquils bloomed and died many times and nights of horror repeated the story of their shame but he was unchanged no winter marred his face or stained his flowerlike bloom how different it was with material things where had they passed to where was the great crocuscoloured robe on which the gods fought against the giants that had been worked by brown girls for the pleasure of athena where the huge velarium that nero had stretched across the colosseum at rome that titan sail of purple on which was represented the starry sky and apollo driving a chariot drawn by white giltreined steeds he longed to see the curious tablenapkins wrought for the priest of the sun on which were displayed all the dainties and viands that could be wanted for a feast the mortuary cloth of king chilperic with its three hundred golden bees the fantastic robes that excited the indignation of the bishop of pontus and were figured with lions panthers bears dogs forests rocks huntersall in fact that a painter can copy from nature and the coat that charles of orleans once wore on the sleeves of which were embroidered the verses of a song beginning madame je suis tout joyeux the musical accompaniment of the words being wrought in gold thread and each note of square shape in those days formed with four pearls he read of the room that was prepared at the palace at rheims for the use of queen joan of burgundy and was decorated with thirteen hundred and twentyone parrots made in broidery and blazoned with the kings arms and five hundred and sixtyone butterflies whose wings were similarly ornamented with the arms of the queen the whole worked in gold catherine de medicis had a mourningbed made for her of black velvet powdered with crescents and suns its curtains were of damask with leafy wreaths and garlands figured upon a gold and silver ground and fringed along the edges with broideries of pearls and it stood in a room hung with rows of the queens devices in cut black velvet upon cloth of silver louis xiv had gold embroidered caryatides fifteen feet high in his apartment the state bed of sobieski king of poland was made of smyrna gold brocade embroidered in turquoises with verses from the koran its supports were of silver gilt beautifully chased and profusely set with enamelled and jewelled medallions it had been taken from the turkish camp before vienna and the standard of mohammed had stood beneath the tremulous gilt of its canopy ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and so for a whole year he sought to accumulate the most exquisite specimens that he could find of textile and embroidered work getting the dainty delhi muslins finely wrought with goldthread palmates and stitched over with iridescent beetles wings the dacca gauzes that from their transparency are known in the east as woven air and running water and evening dew strange figured cloths from java elaborate yellow chinese hangings books bound in tawny satins or fair blue silks and wrought with fleursdelis birds and images veils of lacis worked in hungary point sicilian brocades and stiff spanish velvets georgian work with its gilt coins and japanese foukousas with their greentoned golds and their marvellously plumaged birds ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he had a special passion also for ecclesiastical vestments as indeed he had for everything connected with the service of the church in the long cedar chests that lined the west gallery of his house he had stored away many rare and beautiful specimens of what is really the raiment of the bride of christ who must wear purple and jewels and fine linen that she may hide the pallid macerated body that is worn by the suffering that she seeks for and wounded by selfinflicted pain he possessed a gorgeous cope of crimson silk and goldthread damask figured with a repeating pattern of golden pomegranates set in sixpetalled formal blossoms beyond which on either side was the pineapple device wrought in seedpearls the orphreys were divided into panels representing scenes from the life of the virgin and the coronation of the virgin was figured in coloured silks upon the hood this was italian work of the fifteenth century another cope was of green velvet embroidered with heartshaped groups of acanthusleaves from which spread longstemmed white blossoms the details of which were picked out with silver thread and coloured crystals the morse bore a seraphs head in goldthread raised work the orphreys were woven in a diaper of red and gold silk and were starred with medallions of many saints and martyrs among whom was st sebastian he had chasubles also of ambercoloured silk and blue silk and gold brocade and yellow silk damask and cloth of gold figured with representations of the passion and crucifixion of christ and embroidered with lions and peacocks and other emblems dalmatics of white satin and pink silk damask decorated with tulips and dolphins and fleursdelis altar frontals of crimson velvet and blue linen and many corporals chaliceveils and sudaria in the mystic offices to which such things were put there was something that quickened his imagination ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for these treasures and everything that he collected in his lovely house were to be to him means of forgetfulness modes by which he could escape for a season from the fear that seemed to him at times to be almost too great to be borne upon the walls of the lonely locked room where he had spent so much of his boyhood he had hung with his own hands the terrible portrait whose changing features showed him the real degradation of his life and in front of it had draped the purpleandgold pall as a curtain for weeks he would not go there would forget the hideous painted thing and get back his light heart his wonderful joyousness his passionate absorption in mere existence then suddenly some night he would creep out of the house go down to dreadful places near blue gate fields and stay there day after day until he was driven away on his return he would sit in front of the picture sometimes loathing it and himself but filled at other times with that pride of individualism that is half the fascination of sin and smiling with secret pleasure at the misshapen shadow that had to bear the burden that should have been his own ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after a few years he could not endure to be long out of england and gave up the villa that he had shared at trouville with lord henry as well as the little white walledin house at algiers where they had more than once spent the winter he hated to be separated from the picture that was such a part of his life and was also afraid that during his absence some one might gain access to the room in spite of the elaborate bars that he had caused to be placed upon the door ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he was quite conscious that this would tell them nothing it was true that the portrait still preserved under all the foulness and ugliness of the face its marked likeness to himself but what could they learn from that he would laugh at any one who tried to taunt him he had not painted it what was it to him how vile and full of shame it looked even if he told them would they believe it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yet he was afraid sometimes when he was down at his great house in nottinghamshire entertaining the fashionable young men of his own rank who were his chief companions and astounding the county by the wanton luxury and gorgeous splendour of his mode of life he would suddenly leave his guests and rush back to town to see that the door had not been tampered with and that the picture was still there what if it should be stolen the mere thought made him cold with horror surely the world would know his secret then perhaps the world already suspected it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
for while he fascinated many there were not a few who distrusted him he was very nearly blackballed at a west end club of which his birth and social position fully entitled him to become a member and it was said that on one occasion when he was brought by a friend into the smokingroom of the churchill the duke of berwick and another gentleman got up in a marked manner and went out curious stories became current about him after he had passed his twentyfifth year it was rumoured that he had been seen brawling with foreign sailors in a low den in the distant parts of whitechapel and that he consorted with thieves and coiners and knew the mysteries of their trade his extraordinary absences became notorious and when he used to reappear again in society men would whisper to each other in corners or pass him with a sneer or look at him with cold searching eyes as though they were determined to discover his secret ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
of such insolences and attempted slights he of course took no notice and in the opinion of most people his frank debonair manner his charming boyish smile and the infinite grace of that wonderful youth that seemed never to leave him were in themselves a sufficient answer to the calumnies for so they termed them that were circulated about him it was remarked however that some of those who had been most intimate with him appeared after a time to shun him women who had wildly adored him and for his sake had braved all social censure and set convention at defiance were seen to grow pallid with shame or horror if dorian gray entered the room ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yet these whispered scandals only increased in the eyes of many his strange and dangerous charm his great wealth was a certain element of security societycivilized society at leastis never very ready to believe anything to the detriment of those who are both rich and fascinating it feels instinctively that manners are of more importance than morals and in its opinion the highest respectability is of much less value than the possession of a good chef and after all it is a very poor consolation to be told that the man who has given one a bad dinner or poor wine is irreproachable in his private life even the cardinal virtues cannot atone for halfcold entres as lord henry remarked once in a discussion on the subject and there is possibly a good deal to be said for his view for the canons of good society are or should be the same as the canons of art form is absolutely essential to it it should have the dignity of a ceremony as well as its unreality and should combine the insincere character of a romantic play with the wit and beauty that make such plays delightful to us is insincerity such a terrible thing i think not it is merely a method by which we can multiply our personalities ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
such at any rate was dorian grays opinion he used to wonder at the shallow psychology of those who conceive the ego in man as a thing simple permanent reliable and of one essence to him man was a being with myriad lives and myriad sensations a complex multiform creature that bore within itself strange legacies of thought and passion and whose very flesh was tainted with the monstrous maladies of the dead he loved to stroll through the gaunt cold picturegallery of his country house and look at the various portraits of those whose blood flowed in his veins here was philip herbert described by francis osborne in his memoires on the reigns of queen elizabeth and king james as one who was caressed by the court for his handsome face which kept him not long company was it young herberts life that he sometimes led had some strange poisonous germ crept from body to body till it had reached his own was it some dim sense of that ruined grace that had made him so suddenly and almost without cause give utterance in basil hallwards studio to the mad prayer that had so changed his life here in goldembroidered red doublet jewelled surcoat and giltedged ruff and wristbands stood sir anthony sherard with his silverandblack armour piled at his feet what had this mans legacy been had the lover of giovanna of naples bequeathed him some inheritance of sin and shame were his own actions merely the dreams that the dead man had not dared to realize here from the fading canvas smiled lady elizabeth devereux in her gauze hood pearl stomacher and pink slashed sleeves a flower was in her right hand and her left clasped an enamelled collar of white and damask roses on a table by her side lay a mandolin and an apple there were large green rosettes upon her little pointed shoes he knew her life and the strange stories that were told about her lovers had he something of her temperament in him these oval heavylidded eyes seemed to look curiously at him what of george willoughby with his powdered hair and fantastic patches how evil he looked the face was saturnine and swarthy and the sensual lips seemed to be twisted with disdain delicate lace ruffles fell over the lean yellow hands that were so overladen with rings he had been a macaroni of the eighteenth century and the friend in his youth of lord ferrars what of the second lord beckenham the companion of the prince regent in his wildest days and one of the witnesses at the secret marriage with mrs fitzherbert how proud and handsome he was with his chestnut curls and insolent pose what passions had he bequeathed the world had looked upon him as infamous he had led the orgies at carlton house the star of the garter glittered upon his breast beside him hung the portrait of his wife a pallid thinlipped woman in black her blood also stirred within him how curious it all seemed and his mother with her lady hamilton face and her moist winedashed lipshe knew what he had got from her he had got from her his beauty and his passion for the beauty of others she laughed at him in her loose bacchante dress there were vine leaves in her hair the purple spilled from the cup she was holding the carnations of the painting had withered but the eyes were still wonderful in their depth and brilliancy of colour they seemed to follow him wherever he went ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yet one had ancestors in literature as well as in ones own race nearer perhaps in type and temperament many of them and certainly with an influence of which one was more absolutely conscious there were times when it appeared to dorian gray that the whole of history was merely the record of his own life not as he had lived it in act and circumstance but as his imagination had created it for him as it had been in his brain and in his passions he felt that he had known them all those strange terrible figures that had passed across the stage of the world and made sin so marvellous and evil so full of subtlety it seemed to him that in some mysterious way their lives had been his own ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the hero of the wonderful novel that had so influenced his life had himself known this curious fancy in the seventh chapter he tells how crowned with laurel lest lightning might strike him he had sat as tiberius in a garden at capri reading the shameful books of elephantis while dwarfs and peacocks strutted round him and the fluteplayer mocked the swinger of the censer and as caligula had caroused with the greenshirted jockeys in their stables and supped in an ivory manger with a jewelfrontleted horse and as domitian had wandered through a corridor lined with marble mirrors looking round with haggard eyes for the reflection of the dagger that was to end his days and sick with that ennui that terrible tdium vit that comes on those to whom life denies nothing and had peered through a clear emerald at the red shambles of the circus and then in a litter of pearl and purple drawn by silvershod mules been carried through the street of pomegranates to a house of gold and heard men cry on nero caesar as he passed by and as elagabalus had painted his face with colours and plied the distaff among the women and brought the moon from carthage and given her in mystic marriage to the sun ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
over and over again dorian used to read this fantastic chapter and the two chapters immediately following in which as in some curious tapestries or cunningly wrought enamels were pictured the awful and beautiful forms of those whom vice and blood and weariness had made monstrous or mad filippo duke of milan who slew his wife and painted her lips with a scarlet poison that her lover might suck death from the dead thing he fondled pietro barbi the venetian known as paul the second who sought in his vanity to assume the title of formosus and whose tiara valued at two hundred thousand florins was bought at the price of a terrible sin gian maria visconti who used hounds to chase living men and whose murdered body was covered with roses by a harlot who had loved him the borgia on his white horse with fratricide riding beside him and his mantle stained with the blood of perotto pietro riario the young cardinal archbishop of florence child and minion of sixtus iv whose beauty was equalled only by his debauchery and who received leonora of aragon in a pavilion of white and crimson silk filled with nymphs and centaurs and gilded a boy that he might serve at the feast as ganymede or hylas ezzelin whose melancholy could be cured only by the spectacle of death and who had a passion for red blood as other men have for red winethe son of the fiend as was reported and one who had cheated his father at dice when gambling with him for his own soul giambattista cibo who in mockery took the name of innocent and into whose torpid veins the blood of three lads was infused by a jewish doctor sigismondo malatesta the lover of isotta and the lord of rimini whose effigy was burned at rome as the enemy of god and man who strangled polyssena with a napkin and gave poison to ginevra deste in a cup of emerald and in honour of a shameful passion built a pagan church for christian worship charles vi who had so wildly adored his brothers wife that a leper had warned him of the insanity that was coming on him and who when his brain had sickened and grown strange could only be soothed by saracen cards painted with the images of love and death and madness and in his trimmed jerkin and jewelled cap and acanthuslike curls grifonetto baglioni who slew astorre with his bride and simonetto with his page and whose comeliness was such that as he lay dying in the yellow piazza of perugia those who had hated him could not choose but weep and atalanta who had cursed him blessed him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there was a horrible fascination in them all he saw them at night and they troubled his imagination in the day the renaissance knew of strange manners of poisoningpoisoning by a helmet and a lighted torch by an embroidered glove and a jewelled fan by a gilded pomander and by an amber chain dorian gray had been poisoned by a book there were moments when he looked on evil simply as a mode through which he could realize his conception of the beautiful ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he was walking home about eleven oclock from lord henrys where he had been dining and was wrapped in heavy furs as the night was cold and foggy at the corner of grosvenor square and south audley street a man passed him in the mist walking very fast and with the collar of his grey ulster turned up he had a bag in his hand dorian recognized him it was basil hallward a strange sense of fear for which he could not account came over him he made no sign of recognition and went on quickly in the direction of his own house ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian what an extraordinary piece of luck i have been waiting for you in your library ever since nine oclock finally i took pity on your tired servant and told him to go to bed as he let me out i am off to paris by the midnight train and i particularly wanted to see you before i left i thought it was you or rather your fur coat as you passed me but i wasnt quite sure didnt you recognize me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
in this fog my dear basil why i cant even recognize grosvenor square i believe my house is somewhere about here but i dont feel at all certain about it i am sorry you are going away as i have not seen you for ages but i suppose you will be back soon ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
no i am going to be out of england for six months i intend to take a studio in paris and shut myself up till i have finished a great picture i have in my head however it wasnt about myself i wanted to talk here we are at your door let me come in for a moment i have something to say to you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the lamplight struggled out through the fog and hallward looked at his watch i have heaps of time he answered the train doesnt go till twelvefifteen and it is only just eleven in fact i was on my way to the club to look for you when i met you you see i shant have any delay about luggage as i have sent on my heavy things all i have with me is in this bag and i can easily get to victoria in twenty minutes ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian looked at him and smiled what a way for a fashionable painter to travel a gladstone bag and an ulster come in or the fog will get into the house and mind you dont talk about anything serious nothing is serious nowadays at least nothing should be ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
hallward shook his head as he entered and followed dorian into the library there was a bright wood fire blazing in the large open hearth the lamps were lit and an open dutch silver spiritcase stood with some siphons of sodawater and large cutglass tumblers on a little marqueterie table ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you see your servant made me quite at home dorian he gave me everything i wanted including your best goldtipped cigarettes he is a most hospitable creature i like him much better than the frenchman you used to have what has become of the frenchman by the bye ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian shrugged his shoulders i believe he married lady radleys maid and has established her in paris as an english dressmaker anglomanie is very fashionable over there now i hear it seems silly of the french doesnt it butdo you knowhe was not at all a bad servant i never liked him but i had nothing to complain about one often imagines things that are quite absurd he was really very devoted to me and seemed quite sorry when he went away have another brandyandsoda or would you like hockandseltzer i always take hockandseltzer myself there is sure to be some in the next room ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
thanks i wont have anything more said the painter taking his cap and coat off and throwing them on the bag that he had placed in the corner and now my dear fellow i want to speak to you seriously dont frown like that you make it so much more difficult for me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
they must interest you dorian every gentleman is interested in his good name you dont want people to talk of you as something vile and degraded of course you have your position and your wealth and all that kind of thing but position and wealth are not everything mind you i dont believe these rumours at all at least i cant believe them when i see you sin is a thing that writes itself across a mans face it cannot be concealed people talk sometimes of secret vices there are no such things if a wretched man has a vice it shows itself in the lines of his mouth the droop of his eyelids the moulding of his hands even somebodyi wont mention his name but you know himcame to me last year to have his portrait done i had never seen him before and had never heard anything about him at the time though i have heard a good deal since he offered an extravagant price i refused him there was something in the shape of his fingers that i hated i know now that i was quite right in what i fancied about him his life is dreadful but you dorian with your pure bright innocent face and your marvellous untroubled youthi cant believe anything against you and yet i see you very seldom and you never come down to the studio now and when i am away from you and i hear all these hideous things that people are whispering about you i dont know what to say why is it dorian that a man like the duke of berwick leaves the room of a club when you enter it why is it that so many gentlemen in london will neither go to your house or invite you to theirs you used to be a friend of lord staveley i met him at dinner last week your name happened to come up in conversation in connection with the miniatures you have lent to the exhibition at the dudley staveley curled his lip and said that you might have the most artistic tastes but that you were a man whom no pureminded girl should be allowed to know and whom no chaste woman should sit in the same room with i reminded him that i was a friend of yours and asked him what he meant he told me he told me right out before everybody it was horrible why is your friendship so fatal to young men there was that wretched boy in the guards who committed suicide you were his great friend there was sir henry ashton who had to leave england with a tarnished name you and he were inseparable what about adrian singleton and his dreadful end what about lord kents only son and his career i met his father yesterday in st jamess street he seemed broken with shame and sorrow what about the young duke of perth what sort of life has he got now what gentleman would associate with him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
stop basil you are talking about things of which you know nothing said dorian gray biting his lip and with a note of infinite contempt in his voice you ask me why berwick leaves a room when i enter it it is because i know everything about his life not because he knows anything about mine with such blood as he has in his veins how could his record be clean you ask me about henry ashton and young perth did i teach the one his vices and the other his debauchery if kents silly son takes his wife from the streets what is that to me if adrian singleton writes his friends name across a bill am i his keeper i know how people chatter in england the middle classes air their moral prejudices over their gross dinnertables and whisper about what they call the profligacies of their betters in order to try and pretend that they are in smart society and on intimate terms with the people they slander in this country it is enough for a man to have distinction and brains for every common tongue to wag against him and what sort of lives do these people who pose as being moral lead themselves my dear fellow you forget that we are in the native land of the hypocrite ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian cried hallward that is not the question england is bad enough i know and english society is all wrong that is the reason why i want you to be fine you have not been fine one has a right to judge of a man by the effect he has over his friends yours seem to lose all sense of honour of goodness of purity you have filled them with a madness for pleasure they have gone down into the depths you led them there yes you led them there and yet you can smile as you are smiling now and there is worse behind i know you and harry are inseparable surely for that reason if for none other you should not have made his sisters name a byword ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i must speak and you must listen you shall listen when you met lady gwendolen not a breath of scandal had ever touched her is there a single decent woman in london now who would drive with her in the park why even her children are not allowed to live with her then there are other storiesstories that you have been seen creeping at dawn out of dreadful houses and slinking in disguise into the foulest dens in london are they true can they be true when i first heard them i laughed i hear them now and they make me shudder what about your countryhouse and the life that is led there dorian you dont know what is said about you i wont tell you that i dont want to preach to you i remember harry saying once that every man who turned himself into an amateur curate for the moment always began by saying that and then proceeded to break his word i do want to preach to you i want you to lead such a life as will make the world respect you i want you to have a clean name and a fair record i want you to get rid of the dreadful people you associate with dont shrug your shoulders like that dont be so indifferent you have a wonderful influence let it be for good not for evil they say that you corrupt every one with whom you become intimate and that it is quite sufficient for you to enter a house for shame of some kind to follow after i dont know whether it is so or not how should i know but it is said of you i am told things that it seems impossible to doubt lord gloucester was one of my greatest friends at oxford he showed me a letter that his wife had written to him when she was dying alone in her villa at mentone your name was implicated in the most terrible confession i ever read i told him that it was absurdthat i knew you thoroughly and that you were incapable of anything of the kind know you i wonder do i know you before i could answer that i should have to see your soul ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a bitter laugh of mockery broke from the lips of the younger man you shall see it yourself tonight he cried seizing a lamp from the table come it is your own handiwork why shouldnt you look at it you can tell the world all about it afterwards if you choose nobody would believe you if they did believe you they would like me all the better for it i know the age better than you do though you will prate about it so tediously come i tell you you have chattered enough about corruption now you shall look on it face to face ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there was the madness of pride in every word he uttered he stamped his foot upon the ground in his boyish insolent manner he felt a terrible joy at the thought that some one else was to share his secret and that the man who had painted the portrait that was the origin of all his shame was to be burdened for the rest of his life with the hideous memory of what he had done ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a twisted flash of pain shot across the painters face he paused for a moment and a wild feeling of pity came over him after all what right had he to pry into the life of dorian gray if he had done a tithe of what was rumoured about him how much he must have suffered then he straightened himself up and walked over to the fireplace and stood there looking at the burning logs with their frostlike ashes and their throbbing cores of flame ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he turned round what i have to say is this he cried you must give me some answer to these horrible charges that are made against you if you tell me that they are absolutely untrue from beginning to end i shall believe you deny them dorian deny them cant you see what i am going through my god dont tell me that you are bad and corrupt and shameful ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray smiled there was a curl of contempt in his lips come upstairs basil he said quietly i keep a diary of my life from day to day and it never leaves the room in which it is written i shall show it to you if you come with me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he passed out of the room and began the ascent basil hallward following close behind they walked softly as men do instinctively at night the lamp cast fantastic shadows on the wall and staircase a rising wind made some of the windows rattle ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am delighted he answered smiling then he added somewhat harshly you are the one man in the world who is entitled to know everything about me you have had more to do with my life than you think and taking up the lamp he opened the door and went in a cold current of air passed them and the light shot up for a moment in a flame of murky orange he shuddered shut the door behind you he whispered as he placed the lamp on the table ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
hallward glanced round him with a puzzled expression the room looked as if it had not been lived in for years a faded flemish tapestry a curtained picture an old italian cassone and an almost empty bookcasethat was all that it seemed to contain besides a chair and a table as dorian gray was lighting a halfburned candle that was standing on the mantelshelf he saw that the whole place was covered with dust and that the carpet was in holes a mouse ran scuffling behind the wainscoting there was a damp odour of mildew ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
an exclamation of horror broke from the painters lips as he saw in the dim light the hideous face on the canvas grinning at him there was something in its expression that filled him with disgust and loathing good heavens it was dorian grays own face that he was looking at the horror whatever it was had not yet entirely spoiled that marvellous beauty there was still some gold in the thinning hair and some scarlet on the sensual mouth the sodden eyes had kept something of the loveliness of their blue the noble curves had not yet completely passed away from chiselled nostrils and from plastic throat yes it was dorian himself but who had done it he seemed to recognize his own brushwork and the frame was his own design the idea was monstrous yet he felt afraid he seized the lighted candle and held it to the picture in the lefthand corner was his own name traced in long letters of bright vermilion ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was some foul parody some infamous ignoble satire he had never done that still it was his own picture he knew it and he felt as if his blood had changed in a moment from fire to sluggish ice his own picture what did it mean why had it altered he turned and looked at dorian gray with the eyes of a sick man his mouth twitched and his parched tongue seemed unable to articulate he passed his hand across his forehead it was dank with clammy sweat ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the young man was leaning against the mantelshelf watching him with that strange expression that one sees on the faces of those who are absorbed in a play when some great artist is acting there was neither real sorrow in it nor real joy there was simply the passion of the spectator with perhaps a flicker of triumph in his eyes he had taken the flower out of his coat and was smelling it or pretending to do so ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
years ago when i was a boy said dorian gray crushing the flower in his hand you met me flattered me and taught me to be vain of my good looks one day you introduced me to a friend of yours who explained to me the wonder of youth and you finished a portrait of me that revealed to me the wonder of beauty in a mad moment that even now i dont know whether i regret or not i made a wish perhaps you would call it a prayer ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i remember it oh how well i remember it no the thing is impossible the room is damp mildew has got into the canvas the paints i used had some wretched mineral poison in them i tell you the thing is impossible ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
hallward turned again to the portrait and gazed at it my god if it is true he exclaimed and this is what you have done with your life why you must be worse even than those who talk against you fancy you to be he held the light up again to the canvas and examined it the surface seemed to be quite undisturbed and as he had left it it was from within apparently that the foulness and horror had come through some strange quickening of inner life the leprosies of sin were slowly eating the thing away the rotting of a corpse in a watery grave was not so fearful ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
his hand shook and the candle fell from its socket on the floor and lay there sputtering he placed his foot on it and put it out then he flung himself into the rickety chair that was standing by the table and buried his face in his hands ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
good god dorian what a lesson what an awful lesson there was no answer but he could hear the young man sobbing at the window pray dorian pray he murmured what is it that one was taught to say in ones boyhood lead us not into temptation forgive us our sins wash away our iniquities let us say that together the prayer of your pride has been answered the prayer of your repentance will be answered also i worshipped you too much i am punished for it you worshipped yourself too much we are both punished ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray glanced at the picture and suddenly an uncontrollable feeling of hatred for basil hallward came over him as though it had been suggested to him by the image on the canvas whispered into his ear by those grinning lips the mad passions of a hunted animal stirred within him and he loathed the man who was seated at the table more than in his whole life he had ever loathed anything he glanced wildly around something glimmered on the top of the painted chest that faced him his eye fell on it he knew what it was it was a knife that he had brought up some days before to cut a piece of cord and had forgotten to take away with him he moved slowly towards it passing hallward as he did so as soon as he got behind him he seized it and turned round hallward stirred in his chair as if he was going to rise he rushed at him and dug the knife into the great vein that is behind the ear crushing the mans head down on the table and stabbing again and again ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there was a stifled groan and the horrible sound of some one choking with blood three times the outstretched arms shot up convulsively waving grotesque stifffingered hands in the air he stabbed him twice more but the man did not move something began to trickle on the floor he waited for a moment still pressing the head down then he threw the knife on the table and listened ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he could hear nothing but the drip drip on the threadbare carpet he opened the door and went out on the landing the house was absolutely quiet no one was about for a few seconds he stood bending over the balustrade and peering down into the black seething well of darkness then he took out the key and returned to the room locking himself in as he did so ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the thing was still seated in the chair straining over the table with bowed head and humped back and long fantastic arms had it not been for the red jagged tear in the neck and the clotted black pool that was slowly widening on the table one would have said that the man was simply asleep ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
how quickly it had all been done he felt strangely calm and walking over to the window opened it and stepped out on the balcony the wind had blown the fog away and the sky was like a monstrous peacocks tail starred with myriads of golden eyes he looked down and saw the policeman going his rounds and flashing the long beam of his lantern on the doors of the silent houses the crimson spot of a prowling hansom gleamed at the corner and then vanished a woman in a fluttering shawl was creeping slowly by the railings staggering as she went now and then she stopped and peered back once she began to sing in a hoarse voice the policeman strolled over and said something to her she stumbled away laughing a bitter blast swept across the square the gaslamps flickered and became blue and the leafless trees shook their black iron branches to and fro he shivered and went back closing the window behind him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
having reached the door he turned the key and opened it he did not even glance at the murdered man he felt that the secret of the whole thing was not to realize the situation the friend who had painted the fatal portrait to which all his misery had been due had gone out of his life that was enough ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
then he remembered the lamp it was a rather curious one of moorish workmanship made of dull silver inlaid with arabesques of burnished steel and studded with coarse turquoises perhaps it might be missed by his servant and questions would be asked he hesitated for a moment then he turned back and took it from the table he could not help seeing the dead thing how still it was how horribly white the long hands looked it was like a dreadful wax image ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
having locked the door behind him he crept quietly downstairs the woodwork creaked and seemed to cry out as if in pain he stopped several times and waited no everything was still it was merely the sound of his own footsteps ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when he reached the library he saw the bag and coat in the corner they must be hidden away somewhere he unlocked a secret press that was in the wainscoting a press in which he kept his own curious disguises and put them into it he could easily burn them afterwards then he pulled out his watch it was twenty minutes to two ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he sat down and began to think every yearevery month almostmen were strangled in england for what he had done there had been a madness of murder in the air some red star had come too close to the earth and yet what evidence was there against him basil hallward had left the house at eleven no one had seen him come in again most of the servants were at selby royal his valet had gone to bed paris yes it was to paris that basil had gone and by the midnight train as he had intended with his curious reserved habits it would be months before any suspicions would be roused months everything could be destroyed long before then ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a sudden thought struck him he put on his fur coat and hat and went out into the hall there he paused hearing the slow heavy tread of the policeman on the pavement outside and seeing the flash of the bullseye reflected in the window he waited and held his breath ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after a few moments he drew back the latch and slipped out shutting the door very gently behind him then he began ringing the bell in about five minutes his valet appeared halfdressed and looking very drowsy ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray threw his hat and coat upon the table and passed into the library for a quarter of an hour he walked up and down the room biting his lip and thinking then he took down the blue book from one of the shelves and began to turn over the leaves alan campbell  hertford street mayfair yes that was the man he wanted ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at nine oclock the next morning his servant came in with a cup of chocolate on a tray and opened the shutters dorian was sleeping quite peacefully lying on his right side with one hand underneath his cheek he looked like a boy who had been tired out with play or study ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the man had to touch him twice on the shoulder before he woke and as he opened his eyes a faint smile passed across his lips as though he had been lost in some delightful dream yet he had not dreamed at all his night had been untroubled by any images of pleasure or of pain but youth smiles without any reason it is one of its chiefest charms ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he turned round and leaning upon his elbow began to sip his chocolate the mellow november sun came streaming into the room the sky was bright and there was a genial warmth in the air it was almost like a morning in may ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
gradually the events of the preceding night crept with silent bloodstained feet into his brain and reconstructed themselves there with terrible distinctness he winced at the memory of all that he had suffered and for a moment the same curious feeling of loathing for basil hallward that had made him kill him as he sat in the chair came back to him and he grew cold with passion the dead man was still sitting there too and in the sunlight now how horrible that was such hideous things were for the darkness not for the day ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he felt that if he brooded on what he had gone through he would sicken or grow mad there were sins whose fascination was more in the memory than in the doing of them strange triumphs that gratified the pride more than the passions and gave to the intellect a quickened sense of joy greater than any joy they brought or could ever bring to the senses but this was not one of them it was a thing to be driven out of the mind to be drugged with poppies to be strangled lest it might strangle one itself ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when the halfhour struck he passed his hand across his forehead and then got up hastily and dressed himself with even more than his usual care giving a good deal of attention to the choice of his necktie and scarfpin and changing his rings more than once he spent a long time also over breakfast tasting the various dishes talking to his valet about some new liveries that he was thinking of getting made for the servants at selby and going through his correspondence at some of the letters he smiled three of them bored him one he read several times over and then tore up with a slight look of annoyance in his face that awful thing a womans memory as lord henry had once said ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after he had drunk his cup of black coffee he wiped his lips slowly with a napkin motioned to his servant to wait and going over to the table sat down and wrote two letters one he put in his pocket the other he handed to the valet ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as soon as he was alone he lit a cigarette and began sketching upon a piece of paper drawing first flowers and bits of architecture and then human faces suddenly he remarked that every face that he drew seemed to have a fantastic likeness to basil hallward he frowned and getting up went over to the bookcase and took out a volume at hazard he was determined that he would not think about what had happened until it became absolutely necessary that he should do so ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when he had stretched himself on the sofa he looked at the titlepage of the book it was gautiers maux et cames charpentiers japanesepaper edition with the jacquemart etching the binding was of citrongreen leather with a design of gilt trelliswork and dotted pomegranates it had been given to him by adrian singleton as he turned over the pages his eye fell on the poem about the hand of lacenaire the cold yellow hand du supplice encore mal lave with its downy red hairs and its doigts de faune he glanced at his own white taper fingers shuddering slightly in spite of himself and passed on till he came to those lovely stanzas upon venice ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
sur une gamme chromatique le sein de perles ruisselant la vnus de ladriatique sort de leau son corps rose et blanc ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
les dmes sur lazur des ondes suivant la phrase au pur contour senflent comme des gorges rondes que soulve un soupir damour ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lesquif aborde et me dpose jetant son amarre au pilier devant une faade rose sur le marbre dun escalier ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
how exquisite they were as one read them one seemed to be floating down the green waterways of the pink and pearl city seated in a black gondola with silver prow and trailing curtains the mere lines looked to him like those straight lines of turquoiseblue that follow one as one pushes out to the lido the sudden flashes of colour reminded him of the gleam of the opalandiristhroated birds that flutter round the tall honeycombed campanile or stalk with such stately grace through the dim duststained arcades leaning back with halfclosed eyes he kept saying over and over to himself ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the whole of venice was in those two lines he remembered the autumn that he had passed there and a wonderful love that had stirred him to mad delightful follies there was romance in every place but venice like oxford had kept the background for romance and to the true romantic background was everything or almost everything basil had been with him part of the time and had gone wild over tintoret poor basil what a horrible way for a man to die ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he sighed and took up the volume again and tried to forget he read of the swallows that fly in and out of the little caf at smyrna where the hadjis sit counting their amber beads and the turbaned merchants smoke their long tasselled pipes and talk gravely to each other he read of the obelisk in the place de la concorde that weeps tears of granite in its lonely sunless exile and longs to be back by the hot lotuscovered nile where there are sphinxes and rosered ibises and white vultures with gilded claws and crocodiles with small beryl eyes that crawl over the green steaming mud he began to brood over those verses which drawing music from kissstained marble tell of that curious statue that gautier compares to a contralto voice the monstre charmant that couches in the porphyryroom of the louvre but after a time the book fell from his hand he grew nervous and a horrible fit of terror came over him what if alan campbell should be out of england days would elapse before he could come back perhaps he might refuse to come what could he do then every moment was of vital importance ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
they had been great friends once five years beforealmost inseparable indeed then the intimacy had come suddenly to an end when they met in society now it was only dorian gray who smiled alan campbell never did ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he was an extremely clever young man though he had no real appreciation of the visible arts and whatever little sense of the beauty of poetry he possessed he had gained entirely from dorian his dominant intellectual passion was for science at cambridge he had spent a great deal of his time working in the laboratory and had taken a good class in the natural science tripos of his year indeed he was still devoted to the study of chemistry and had a laboratory of his own in which he used to shut himself up all day long greatly to the annoyance of his mother who had set her heart on his standing for parliament and had a vague idea that a chemist was a person who made up prescriptions he was an excellent musician however as well and played both the violin and the piano better than most amateurs in fact it was music that had first brought him and dorian gray togethermusic and that indefinable attraction that dorian seemed to be able to exercise whenever he wishedand indeed exercised often without being conscious of it they had met at lady berkshires the night that rubinstein played there and after that used to be always seen together at the opera and wherever good music was going on for eighteen months their intimacy lasted campbell was always either at selby royal or in grosvenor square to him as to many others dorian gray was the type of everything that is wonderful and fascinating in life whether or not a quarrel had taken place between them no one ever knew but suddenly people remarked that they scarcely spoke when they met and that campbell seemed always to go away early from any party at which dorian gray was present he had changed toowas strangely melancholy at times appeared almost to dislike hearing music and would never himself play giving as his excuse when he was called upon that he was so absorbed in science that he had no time left in which to practise and this was certainly true every day he seemed to become more interested in biology and his name appeared once or twice in some of the scientific reviews in connection with certain curious experiments ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
this was the man dorian gray was waiting for every second he kept glancing at the clock as the minutes went by he became horribly agitated at last he got up and began to pace up and down the room looking like a beautiful caged thing he took long stealthy strides his hands were curiously cold ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the suspense became unbearable time seemed to him to be crawling with feet of lead while he by monstrous winds was being swept towards the jagged edge of some black cleft of precipice he knew what was waiting for him there saw it indeed and shuddering crushed with dank hands his burning lids as though he would have robbed the very brain of sight and driven the eyeballs back into their cave it was useless the brain had its own food on which it battened and the imagination made grotesque by terror twisted and distorted as a living thing by pain danced like some foul puppet on a stand and grinned through moving masks then suddenly time stopped for him yes that blind slowbreathing thing crawled no more and horrible thoughts time being dead raced nimbly on in front and dragged a hideous future from its grave and showed it to him he stared at it its very horror made him stone ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i had intended never to enter your house again gray but you said it was a matter of life and death his voice was hard and cold he spoke with slow deliberation there was a look of contempt in the steady searching gaze that he turned on dorian he kept his hands in the pockets of his astrakhan coat and seemed not to have noticed the gesture with which he had been greeted ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after a strained moment of silence he leaned across and said very quietly but watching the effect of each word upon the face of him he had sent for alan in a locked room at the top of this house a room to which nobody but myself has access a dead man is seated at a table he has been dead ten hours now dont stir and dont look at me like that who the man is why he died how he died are matters that do not concern you what you have to do is this ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
stop gray i dont want to know anything further whether what you have told me is true or not true doesnt concern me i entirely decline to be mixed up in your life keep your horrible secrets to yourself they dont interest me any more ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
alan they will have to interest you this one will have to interest you i am awfully sorry for you alan but i cant help myself you are the one man who is able to save me i am forced to bring you into the matter i have no option alan you are scientific you know about chemistry and things of that kind you have made experiments what you have got to do is to destroy the thing that is upstairsto destroy it so that not a vestige of it will be left nobody saw this person come into the house indeed at the present moment he is supposed to be in paris he will not be missed for months when he is missed there must be no trace of him found here you alan you must change him and everything that belongs to him into a handful of ashes that i may scatter in the air ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you are mad i tell youmad to imagine that i would raise a finger to help you mad to make this monstrous confession i will have nothing to do with this matter whatever it is do you think i am going to peril my reputation for you what is it to me what devils work you are up to ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
of course i refuse i will have absolutely nothing to do with it i dont care what shame comes on you you deserve it all i should not be sorry to see you disgraced publicly disgraced how dare you ask me of all men in the world to mix myself up in this horror i should have thought you knew more about peoples characters your friend lord henry wotton cant have taught you much about psychology whatever else he has taught you nothing will induce me to stir a step to help you you have come to the wrong man go to some of your friends dont come to me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
alan it was murder i killed him you dont know what he had made me suffer whatever my life is he had more to do with the making or the marring of it than poor harry has had he may not have intended it the result was the same ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
murder good god dorian is that what you have come to i shall not inform upon you it is not my business besides without my stirring in the matter you are certain to be arrested nobody ever commits a crime without doing something stupid but i will have nothing to do with it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you must have something to do with it wait wait a moment listen to me only listen alan all i ask of you is to perform a certain scientific experiment you go to hospitals and deadhouses and the horrors that you do there dont affect you if in some hideous dissectingroom or fetid laboratory you found this man lying on a leaden table with red gutters scooped out in it for the blood to flow through you would simply look upon him as an admirable subject you would not turn a hair you would not believe that you were doing anything wrong on the contrary you would probably feel that you were benefiting the human race or increasing the sum of knowledge in the world or gratifying intellectual curiosity or something of that kind what i want you to do is merely what you have often done before indeed to destroy a body must be far less horrible than what you are accustomed to work at and remember it is the only piece of evidence against me if it is discovered i am lost and it is sure to be discovered unless you help me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
alan i entreat you think of the position i am in just before you came i almost fainted with terror you may know terror yourself some day no dont think of that look at the matter purely from the scientific point of view you dont inquire where the dead things on which you experiment come from dont inquire now i have told you too much as it is but i beg of you to do this we were friends once alan ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the dead linger sometimes the man upstairs will not go away he is sitting at the table with bowed head and outstretched arms alan alan if you dont come to my assistance i am ruined why they will hang me alan dont you understand they will hang me for what i have done ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the same look of pity came into dorian grays eyes then he stretched out his hand took a piece of paper and wrote something on it he read it over twice folded it carefully and pushed it across the table having done this he got up and went over to the window ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
campbell looked at him in surprise and then took up the paper and opened it as he read it his face became ghastly pale and he fell back in his chair a horrible sense of sickness came over him he felt as if his heart was beating itself to death in some empty hollow ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i am so sorry for you alan he murmured but you leave me no alternative i have a letter written already here it is you see the address if you dont help me i must send it if you dont help me i will send it you know what the result will be but you are going to help me it is impossible for you to refuse now i tried to spare you you will do me the justice to admit that you were stern harsh offensive you treated me as no man has ever dared to treat meno living man at any rate i bore it all now it is for me to dictate terms ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a groan broke from campbells lips and he shivered all over the ticking of the clock on the mantelpiece seemed to him to be dividing time into separate atoms of agony each of which was too terrible to be borne he felt as if an iron ring was being slowly tightened round his forehead as if the disgrace with which he was threatened had already come upon him the hand upon his shoulder weighed like a hand of lead it was intolerable it seemed to crush him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
campbell scrawled a few lines blotted them and addressed an envelope to his assistant dorian took the note up and read it carefully then he rang the bell and gave it to his valet with orders to return as soon as possible and to bring the things with him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as the hall door shut campbell started nervously and having got up from the chair went over to the chimneypiece he was shivering with a kind of ague for nearly twenty minutes neither of the men spoke a fly buzzed noisily about the room and the ticking of the clock was like the beat of a hammer ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as the chime struck one campbell turned round and looking at dorian gray saw that his eyes were filled with tears there was something in the purity and refinement of that sad face that seemed to enrage him you are infamous absolutely infamous he muttered ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
your life good heavens what a life that is you have gone from corruption to corruption and now you have culminated in crime in doing what i am going to dowhat you force me to doit is not of your life that i am thinking ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yesharden you must go down to richmond at once see harden personally and tell him to send twice as many orchids as i ordered and to have as few white ones as possible in fact i dont want any white ones it is a lovely day francis and richmond is a very pretty placeotherwise i wouldnt bother you about it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it will be time enough then if you are back at halfpast seven francis or stay just leave my things out for dressing you can have the evening to yourself i am not dining at home so i shall not want you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
now alan there is not a moment to be lost how heavy this chest is ill take it for you you bring the other things he spoke rapidly and in an authoritative manner campbell felt dominated by him they left the room together ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian half opened the door as he did so he saw the face of his portrait leering in the sunlight on the floor in front of it the torn curtain was lying he remembered that the night before he had forgotten for the first time in his life to hide the fatal canvas and was about to rush forward when he drew back with a shudder ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
what was that loathsome red dew that gleamed wet and glistening on one of the hands as though the canvas had sweated blood how horrible it wasmore horrible it seemed to him for the moment than the silent thing that he knew was stretched across the table the thing whose grotesque misshapen shadow on the spotted carpet showed him that it had not stirred but was still there as he had left it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he heaved a deep breath opened the door a little wider and with halfclosed eyes and averted head walked quickly in determined that he would not look even once upon the dead man then stooping down and taking up the goldandpurple hanging he flung it right over the picture ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there he stopped feeling afraid to turn round and his eyes fixed themselves on the intricacies of the pattern before him he heard campbell bringing in the heavy chest and the irons and the other things that he had required for his dreadful work he began to wonder if he and basil hallward had ever met and if so what they had thought of each other ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he turned and hurried out just conscious that the dead man had been thrust back into the chair and that campbell was gazing into a glistening yellow face as he was going downstairs he heard the key being turned in the lock ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
that evening at eightthirty exquisitely dressed and wearing a large buttonhole of parma violets dorian gray was ushered into lady narboroughs drawingroom by bowing servants his forehead was throbbing with maddened nerves and he felt wildly excited but his manner as he bent over his hostesss hand was as easy and graceful as ever perhaps one never seems so much at ones ease as when one has to play a part certainly no one looking at dorian gray that night could have believed that he had passed through a tragedy as horrible as any tragedy of our age those finely shaped fingers could never have clutched a knife for sin nor those smiling lips have cried out on god and goodness he himself could not help wondering at the calm of his demeanour and for a moment felt keenly the terrible pleasure of a double life ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was a small party got up rather in a hurry by lady narborough who was a very clever woman with what lord henry used to describe as the remains of really remarkable ugliness she had proved an excellent wife to one of our most tedious ambassadors and having buried her husband properly in a marble mausoleum which she had herself designed and married off her daughters to some rich rather elderly men she devoted herself now to the pleasures of french fiction french cookery and french esprit when she could get it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian was one of her especial favourites and she always told him that she was extremely glad she had not met him in early life i know my dear i should have fallen madly in love with you she used to say and thrown my bonnet right over the mills for your sake it is most fortunate that you were not thought of at the time as it was our bonnets were so unbecoming and the mills were so occupied in trying to raise the wind that i never had even a flirtation with anybody however that was all narboroughs fault he was dreadfully shortsighted and there is no pleasure in taking in a husband who never sees anything ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
her guests this evening were rather tedious the fact was as she explained to dorian behind a very shabby fan one of her married daughters had come up quite suddenly to stay with her and to make matters worse had actually brought her husband with her i think it is most unkind of her my dear she whispered of course i go and stay with them every summer after i come from homburg but then an old woman like me must have fresh air sometimes and besides i really wake them up you dont know what an existence they lead down there it is pure unadulterated country life they get up early because they have so much to do and go to bed early because they have so little to think about there has not been a scandal in the neighbourhood since the time of queen elizabeth and consequently they all fall asleep after dinner you shant sit next either of them you shall sit by me and amuse me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian murmured a graceful compliment and looked round the room yes it was certainly a tedious party two of the people he had never seen before and the others consisted of ernest harrowden one of those middleaged mediocrities so common in london clubs who have no enemies but are thoroughly disliked by their friends lady ruxton an overdressed woman of fortyseven with a hooked nose who was always trying to get herself compromised but was so peculiarly plain that to her great disappointment no one would ever believe anything against her mrs erlynne a pushing nobody with a delightful lisp and venetianred hair lady alice chapman his hostesss daughter a dowdy dull girl with one of those characteristic british faces that once seen are never remembered and her husband a redcheeked whitewhiskered creature who like so many of his class was under the impression that inordinate joviality can atone for an entire lack of ideas ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he was rather sorry he had come till lady narborough looking at the great ormolu gilt clock that sprawled in gaudy curves on the mauvedraped mantelshelf exclaimed how horrid of henry wotton to be so late i sent round to him this morning on chance and he promised faithfully not to disappoint me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
but at dinner he could not eat anything plate after plate went away untasted lady narborough kept scolding him for what she called an insult to poor adolphe who invented the menu specially for you and now and then lord henry looked across at him wondering at his silence and abstracted manner from time to time the butler filled his glass with champagne he drank eagerly and his thirst seemed to increase ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she is still dcollete he answered taking an olive in his long fingers and when she is in a very smart gown she looks like an dition de luxe of a bad french novel she is really wonderful and full of surprises her capacity for family affection is extraordinary when her third husband died her hair turned quite gold from grief ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
she assures me so lady narborough said dorian i asked her whether like marguerite de navarre she had their hearts embalmed and hung at her girdle she told me she didnt because none of them had had any hearts at all ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry looked serious for some moments it is perfectly monstrous he said at last the way people go about nowadays saying things against one behind ones back that are absolutely and entirely true ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you will never marry again lady narborough broke in lord henry you were far too happy when a woman marries again it is because she detested her first husband when a man marries again it is because he adored his first wife women try their luck men risk theirs ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
if he had been you would not have loved him my dear lady was the rejoinder women love us for our defects if we have enough of them they will forgive us everything even our intellects you will never ask me to dinner again after saying this i am afraid lady narborough but it is quite true ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
of course it is true lord henry if we women did not love you for your defects where would you all be not one of you would ever be married you would be a set of unfortunate bachelors not however that that would alter you much nowadays all the married men live like bachelors and all the bachelors like married men ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
ah my dear cried lady narborough putting on her gloves dont tell me that you have exhausted life when a man says that one knows that life has exhausted him lord henry is very wicked and i sometimes wish that i had been but you are made to be goodyou look so good i must find you a nice wife lord henry dont you think that mr gray should get married ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
ah what a cynic you are cried the old lady pushing back her chair and nodding to lady ruxton you must come and dine with me soon again you are really an admirable tonic much better than what sir andrew prescribes for me you must tell me what people you would like to meet though i want it to be a delightful gathering ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the men laughed and mr chapman got up solemnly from the foot of the table and came up to the top dorian gray changed his seat and went and sat by lord henry mr chapman began to talk in a loud voice about the situation in the house of commons he guffawed at his adversaries the word doctrinaireword full of terror to the british mindreappeared from time to time between his explosions an alliterative prefix served as an ornament of oratory he hoisted the union jack on the pinnacles of thought the inherited stupidity of the racesound english common sense he jovially termed itwas shown to be the proper bulwark for society ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he bores me dreadfully almost as much as he bores her she is very clever too clever for a woman she lacks the indefinable charm of weakness it is the feet of clay that make the gold of the image precious her feet are very pretty but they are not feet of clay white porcelain feet if you like they have been through the fire and what fire does not destroy it hardens she has had experiences ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes he answered then he bit his lip no i dont mean that i didnt go to the club i walked about i forget what i did how inquisitive you are harry you always want to know what one has been doing i always want to forget what i have been doing i came in at halfpast two if you wish to know the exact time i had left my latchkey at home and my servant had to let me in if you want any corroborative evidence on the subject you can ask him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry shrugged his shoulders my dear fellow as if i cared let us go up to the drawingroom no sherry thank you mr chapman something has happened to you dorian tell me what it is you are not yourself tonight ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i will try to be there harry he said leaving the room as he drove back to his own house he was conscious that the sense of terror he thought he had strangled had come back to him lord henrys casual questioning had made him lose his nerve for the moment and he wanted his nerve still things that were dangerous had to be destroyed he winced he hated the idea of even touching them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yet it had to be done he realized that and when he had locked the door of his library he opened the secret press into which he had thrust basil hallwards coat and bag a huge fire was blazing he piled another log on it the smell of the singeing clothes and burning leather was horrible it took him threequarters of an hour to consume everything at the end he felt faint and sick and having lit some algerian pastilles in a pierced copper brazier he bathed his hands and forehead with a cool muskscented vinegar ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
suddenly he started his eyes grew strangely bright and he gnawed nervously at his underlip between two of the windows stood a large florentine cabinet made out of ebony and inlaid with ivory and blue lapis he watched it as though it were a thing that could fascinate and make afraid as though it held something that he longed for and yet almost loathed his breath quickened a mad craving came over him he lit a cigarette and then threw it away his eyelids drooped till the long fringed lashes almost touched his cheek but he still watched the cabinet at last he got up from the sofa on which he had been lying went over to it and having unlocked it touched some hidden spring a triangular drawer passed slowly out his fingers moved instinctively towards it dipped in and closed on something it was a small chinese box of black and golddust lacquer elaborately wrought the sides patterned with curved waves and the silken cords hung with round crystals and tasselled in plaited metal threads he opened it inside was a green paste waxy in lustre the odour curiously heavy and persistent ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he hesitated for some moments with a strangely immobile smile upon his face then shivering though the atmosphere of the room was terribly hot he drew himself up and glanced at the clock it was twenty minutes to twelve he put the box back shutting the cabinet doors as he did so and went into his bedroom ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as midnight was striking bronze blows upon the dusky air dorian gray dressed commonly and with a muffler wrapped round his throat crept quietly out of his house in bond street he found a hansom with a good horse he hailed it and in a low voice gave the driver an address ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a cold rain began to fall and the blurred streetlamps looked ghastly in the dripping mist the publichouses were just closing and dim men and women were clustering in broken groups round their doors from some of the bars came the sound of horrible laughter in others drunkards brawled and screamed ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lying back in the hansom with his hat pulled over his forehead dorian gray watched with listless eyes the sordid shame of the great city and now and then he repeated to himself the words that lord henry had said to him on the first day they had met to cure the soul by means of the senses and the senses by means of the soul yes that was the secret he had often tried it and would try it again now there were opium dens where one could buy oblivion dens of horror where the memory of old sins could be destroyed by the madness of sins that were new ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the moon hung low in the sky like a yellow skull from time to time a huge misshapen cloud stretched a long arm across and hid it the gaslamps grew fewer and the streets more narrow and gloomy once the man lost his way and had to drive back half a mile a steam rose from the horse as it splashed up the puddles the sidewindows of the hansom were clogged with a greyflannel mist ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
to cure the soul by means of the senses and the senses by means of the soul how the words rang in his ears his soul certainly was sick to death was it true that the senses could cure it innocent blood had been spilled what could atone for that ah for that there was no atonement but though forgiveness was impossible forgetfulness was possible still and he was determined to forget to stamp the thing out to crush it as one would crush the adder that had stung one indeed what right had basil to have spoken to him as he had done who had made him a judge over others he had said things that were dreadful horrible not to be endured ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
on and on plodded the hansom going slower it seemed to him at each step he thrust up the trap and called to the man to drive faster the hideous hunger for opium began to gnaw at him his throat burned and his delicate hands twitched nervously together he struck at the horse madly with his stick the driver laughed and whipped up he laughed in answer and the man was silent ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
then they passed by lonely brickfields the fog was lighter here and he could see the strange bottleshaped kilns with their orange fanlike tongues of fire a dog barked as they went by and far away in the darkness some wandering seagull screamed the horse stumbled in a rut then swerved aside and broke into a gallop ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after some time they left the clay road and rattled again over roughpaven streets most of the windows were dark but now and then fantastic shadows were silhouetted against some lamplit blind he watched them curiously they moved like monstrous marionettes and made gestures like live things he hated them a dull rage was in his heart as they turned a corner a woman yelled something at them from an open door and two men ran after the hansom for about a hundred yards the driver beat at them with his whip ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it is said that passion makes one think in a circle certainly with hideous iteration the bitten lips of dorian gray shaped and reshaped those subtle words that dealt with soul and sense till he had found in them the full expression as it were of his mood and justified by intellectual approval passions that without such justification would still have dominated his temper from cell to cell of his brain crept the one thought and the wild desire to live most terrible of all mans appetites quickened into force each trembling nerve and fibre ugliness that had once been hateful to him because it made things real became dear to him now for that very reason ugliness was the one reality the coarse brawl the loathsome den the crude violence of disordered life the very vileness of thief and outcast were more vivid in their intense actuality of impression than all the gracious shapes of art the dreamy shadows of song they were what he needed for forgetfulness in three days he would be free ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
suddenly the man drew up with a jerk at the top of a dark lane over the low roofs and jagged chimneystacks of the houses rose the black masts of ships wreaths of white mist clung like ghostly sails to the yards ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian started and peered round this will do he answered and having got out hastily and given the driver the extra fare he had promised him he walked quickly in the direction of the quay here and there a lantern gleamed at the stern of some huge merchantman the light shook and splintered in the puddles a red glare came from an outwardbound steamer that was coaling the slimy pavement looked like a wet mackintosh ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he hurried on towards the left glancing back now and then to see if he was being followed in about seven or eight minutes he reached a small shabby house that was wedged in between two gaunt factories in one of the topwindows stood a lamp he stopped and gave a peculiar knock ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after a little time he heard steps in the passage and the chain being unhooked the door opened quietly and he went in without saying a word to the squat misshapen figure that flattened itself into the shadow as he passed at the end of the hall hung a tattered green curtain that swayed and shook in the gusty wind which had followed him in from the street he dragged it aside and entered a long low room which looked as if it had once been a thirdrate dancingsaloon shrill flaring gasjets dulled and distorted in the flyblown mirrors that faced them were ranged round the walls greasy reflectors of ribbed tin backed them making quivering disks of light the floor was covered with ochrecoloured sawdust trampled here and there into mud and stained with dark rings of spilled liquor some malays were crouching by a little charcoal stove playing with bone counters and showing their white teeth as they chattered in one corner with his head buried in his arms a sailor sprawled over a table and by the tawdrily painted bar that ran across one complete side stood two haggard women mocking an old man who was brushing the sleeves of his coat with an expression of disgust he thinks hes got red ants on him laughed one of them as dorian passed by the man looked at her in terror and began to whimper ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at the end of the room there was a little staircase leading to a darkened chamber as dorian hurried up its three rickety steps the heavy odour of opium met him he heaved a deep breath and his nostrils quivered with pleasure when he entered a young man with smooth yellow hair who was bending over a lamp lighting a long thin pipe looked up at him and nodded in a hesitating manner ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
darlington is not going to do anything my brother paid the bill at last george doesnt speak to me either i dont care he added with a sigh as long as one has this stuff one doesnt want friends i think i have had too many friends ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian winced and looked round at the grotesque things that lay in such fantastic postures on the ragged mattresses the twisted limbs the gaping mouths the staring lustreless eyes fascinated him he knew in what strange heavens they were suffering and what dull hells were teaching them the secret of some new joy they were better off than he was he was prisoned in thought memory like a horrible malady was eating his soul away from time to time he seemed to see the eyes of basil hallward looking at him yet he felt he could not stay the presence of adrian singleton troubled him he wanted to be where no one would know who he was he wanted to escape from himself ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
adrian singleton rose up wearily and followed dorian to the bar a halfcaste in a ragged turban and a shabby ulster grinned a hideous greeting as he thrust a bottle of brandy and two tumblers in front of them the women sidled up and began to chatter dorian turned his back on them and said something in a low voice to adrian singleton ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
two red sparks flashed for a moment in the womans sodden eyes then flickered out and left them dull and glazed she tossed her head and raked the coins off the counter with greedy fingers her companion watched her enviously ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian walked to the door with a look of pain in his face as he drew the curtain aside a hideous laugh broke from the painted lips of the woman who had taken his money there goes the devils bargain she hiccoughed in a hoarse voice ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray hurried along the quay through the drizzling rain his meeting with adrian singleton had strangely moved him and he wondered if the ruin of that young life was really to be laid at his door as basil hallward had said to him with such infamy of insult he bit his lip and for a few seconds his eyes grew sad yet after all what did it matter to him ones days were too brief to take the burden of anothers errors on ones shoulders each man lived his own life and paid his own price for living it the only pity was one had to pay so often for a single fault one had to pay over and over again indeed in her dealings with man destiny never closed her accounts ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there are moments psychologists tell us when the passion for sin or for what the world calls sin so dominates a nature that every fibre of the body as every cell of the brain seems to be instinct with fearful impulses men and women at such moments lose the freedom of their will they move to their terrible end as automatons move choice is taken from them and conscience is either killed or if it lives at all lives but to give rebellion its fascination and disobedience its charm for all sins as theologians weary not of reminding us are sins of disobedience when that high spirit that morning star of evil fell from heaven it was as a rebel that he fell ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
callous concentrated on evil with stained mind and soul hungry for rebellion dorian gray hastened on quickening his step as he went but as he darted aside into a dim archway that had served him often as a short cut to the illfamed place where he was going he felt himself suddenly seized from behind and before he had time to defend himself he was thrust back against the wall with a brutal hand round his throat ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he struggled madly for life and by a terrible effort wrenched the tightening fingers away in a second he heard the click of a revolver and saw the gleam of a polished barrel pointing straight at his head and the dusky form of a short thickset man facing him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you wrecked the life of sibyl vane was the answer and sibyl vane was my sister she killed herself i know it her death is at your door i swore i would kill you in return for years i have sought you i had no clue no trace the two people who could have described you were dead i knew nothing of you but the pet name she used to call you i heard it tonight by chance make your peace with god for tonight you are going to die ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you had better confess your sin for as sure as i am james vane you are going to die there was a horrible moment dorian did not know what to say or do down on your knees growled the man i give you one minute to make your peaceno more i go on board tonight for india and i must do my job first one minute thats all ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dim and wavering as was the windblown light yet it served to show him the hideous error as it seemed into which he had fallen for the face of the man he had sought to kill had all the bloom of boyhood all the unstained purity of youth he seemed little more than a lad of twenty summers hardly older if older indeed at all than his sister had been when they had parted so many years ago it was obvious that this was not the man who had destroyed her life ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian gray drew a long breath you have been on the brink of committing a terrible crime my man he said looking at him sternly let this be a warning to you not to take vengeance into your own hands ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
james vane stood on the pavement in horror he was trembling from head to foot after a little while a black shadow that had been creeping along the dripping wall moved out into the light and came close to him with stealthy footsteps he felt a hand laid on his arm and looked round with a start it was one of the women who had been drinking at the bar ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
why didnt you kill him she hissed out putting haggard face quite close to his i knew you were following him when you rushed out from dalys you fool you should have killed him he has lots of money and hes as bad as bad ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he is not the man i am looking for he answered and i want no mans money i want a mans life the man whose life i want must be nearly forty now this one is little more than a boy thank god i have not got his blood upon my hands ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
strike me dumb if it aint so he is the worst one that comes here they say he has sold himself to the devil for a pretty face its nigh on eighteen years since i met him he hasnt changed much since then i have though she added with a sickly leer ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
a week later dorian gray was sitting in the conservatory at selby royal talking to the pretty duchess of monmouth who with her husband a jadedlooking man of sixty was amongst his guests it was teatime and the mellow light of the huge lacecovered lamp that stood on the table lit up the delicate china and hammered silver of the service at which the duchess was presiding her white hands were moving daintily among the cups and her full red lips were smiling at something that dorian had whispered to her lord henry was lying back in a silkdraped wicker chair looking at them on a peachcoloured divan sat lady narborough pretending to listen to the dukes description of the last brazilian beetle that he had added to his collection three young men in elaborate smokingsuits were handing teacakes to some of the women the houseparty consisted of twelve people and there were more expected to arrive on the next day ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear gladys i would not alter either name for the world they are both perfect i was thinking chiefly of flowers yesterday i cut an orchid for my buttonhole it was a marvellous spotted thing as effective as the seven deadly sins in a thoughtless moment i asked one of the gardeners what it was called he told me it was a fine specimen of robinsoniana or something dreadful of that kind it is a sad truth but we have lost the faculty of giving lovely names to things names are everything i never quarrel with actions my one quarrel is with words that is the reason i hate vulgar realism in literature the man who could call a spade a spade should be compelled to use one it is the only thing he is fit for ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
our host is rather horrid this evening answered the duchess colouring i believe he thinks that monmouth married me on purely scientific principles as the best specimen he could find of a modern butterfly ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i darent mr gray why she invents hats for me you remember the one i wore at lady hilstones gardenparty you dont but it is nice of you to pretend that you do well she made it out of nothing all good hats are made out of nothing ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
not with women said the duchess shaking her head and women rule the world i assure you we cant bear mediocrities we women as some one says love with our ears just as you men love with your eyes if you ever love at all ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear gladys cried lord henry how can you say that romance lives by repetition and repetition converts an appetite into an art besides each time that one loves is the only time one has ever loved difference of object does not alter singleness of passion it merely intensifies it we can have in life but one great experience at best and the secret of life is to reproduce that experience as often as possible ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
women are not always allowed a choice he answered but hardly had he finished the sentence before from the far end of the conservatory came a stifled groan followed by the dull sound of a heavy fall everybody started up the duchess stood motionless in horror and with fear in his eyes lord henry rushed through the flapping palms to find dorian gray lying face downwards on the tiled floor in a deathlike swoon ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he went to his room and dressed there was a wild recklessness of gaiety in his manner as he sat at table but now and then a thrill of terror ran through him when he remembered that pressed against the window of the conservatory like a white handkerchief he had seen the face of james vane watching him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the next day he did not leave the house and indeed spent most of the time in his own room sick with a wild terror of dying and yet indifferent to life itself the consciousness of being hunted snared tracked down had begun to dominate him if the tapestry did but tremble in the wind he shook the dead leaves that were blown against the leaded panes seemed to him like his own wasted resolutions and wild regrets when he closed his eyes he saw again the sailors face peering through the miststained glass and horror seemed once more to lay its hand upon his heart ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
but perhaps it had been only his fancy that had called vengeance out of the night and set the hideous shapes of punishment before him actual life was chaos but there was something terribly logical in the imagination it was the imagination that set remorse to dog the feet of sin it was the imagination that made each crime bear its misshapen brood in the common world of fact the wicked were not punished nor the good rewarded success was given to the strong failure thrust upon the weak that was all besides had any stranger been prowling round the house he would have been seen by the servants or the keepers had any footmarks been found on the flowerbeds the gardeners would have reported it yes it had been merely fancy sibyl vanes brother had not come back to kill him he had sailed away in his ship to founder in some winter sea from him at any rate he was safe why the man did not know who he was could not know who he was the mask of youth had saved him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and yet if it had been merely an illusion how terrible it was to think that conscience could raise such fearful phantoms and give them visible form and make them move before one what sort of life would his be if day and night shadows of his crime were to peer at him from silent corners to mock him from secret places to whisper in his ear as he sat at the feast to wake him with icy fingers as he lay asleep as the thought crept through his brain he grew pale with terror and the air seemed to him to have become suddenly colder oh in what a wild hour of madness he had killed his friend how ghastly the mere memory of the scene he saw it all again each hideous detail came back to him with added horror out of the black cave of time terrible and swathed in scarlet rose the image of his sin when lord henry came in at six oclock he found him crying as one whose heart will break ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was not till the third day that he ventured to go out there was something in the clear pinescented air of that winter morning that seemed to bring him back his joyousness and his ardour for life but it was not merely the physical conditions of environment that had caused the change his own nature had revolted against the excess of anguish that had sought to maim and mar the perfection of its calm with subtle and finely wrought temperaments it is always so their strong passions must either bruise or bend they either slay the man or themselves die shallow sorrows and shallow loves live on the loves and sorrows that are great are destroyed by their own plenitude besides he had convinced himself that he had been the victim of a terrorstricken imagination and looked back now on his fears with something of pity and not a little of contempt ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after breakfast he walked with the duchess for an hour in the garden and then drove across the park to join the shootingparty the crisp frost lay like salt upon the grass the sky was an inverted cup of blue metal a thin film of ice bordered the flat reedgrown lake ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at the corner of the pinewood he caught sight of sir geoffrey clouston the duchesss brother jerking two spent cartridges out of his gun he jumped from the cart and having told the groom to take the mare home made his way towards his guest through the withered bracken and rough undergrowth ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian strolled along by his side the keen aromatic air the brown and red lights that glimmered in the wood the hoarse cries of the beaters ringing out from time to time and the sharp snaps of the guns that followed fascinated him and filled him with a sense of delightful freedom he was dominated by the carelessness of happiness by the high indifference of joy ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
suddenly from a lumpy tussock of old grass some twenty yards in front of them with blacktipped ears erect and long hinder limbs throwing it forward started a hare it bolted for a thicket of alders sir geoffrey put his gun to his shoulder but there was something in the animals grace of movement that strangely charmed dorian gray and he cried out at once dont shoot it geoffrey let it live ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
what nonsense dorian laughed his companion and as the hare bounded into the thicket he fired there were two cries heard the cry of a hare in pain which is dreadful the cry of a man in agony which is worse ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian watched them as they plunged into the alderclump brushing the lithe swinging branches aside in a few moments they emerged dragging a body after them into the sunlight he turned away in horror it seemed to him that misfortune followed wherever he went he heard sir geoffrey ask if the man was really dead and the affirmative answer of the keeper the wood seemed to him to have become suddenly alive with faces there was the trampling of myriad feet and the low buzz of voices a great copperbreasted pheasant came beating through the boughs overhead ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
what is asked lord henry oh this accident i suppose my dear fellow it cant be helped it was the mans own fault why did he get in front of the guns besides it is nothing to us it is rather awkward for geoffrey of course it does not do to pepper beaters it makes people think that one is a wild shot and geoffrey is not he shoots very straight but there is no use talking about the matter ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the elder man laughed the only horrible thing in the world is ennui dorian that is the one sin for which there is no forgiveness but we are not likely to suffer from it unless these fellows keep chattering about this thing at dinner i must tell them that the subject is to be tabooed as for omens there is no such thing as an omen destiny does not send us heralds she is too wise or too cruel for that besides what on earth could happen to you dorian you have everything in the world that a man can want there is no one who would not be delighted to change places with you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there is no one with whom i would not change places harry dont laugh like that i am telling you the truth the wretched peasant who has just died is better off than i am i have no terror of death it is the coming of death that terrifies me its monstrous wings seem to wheel in the leaden air around me good heavens dont you see a man moving behind the trees there watching me waiting for me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry looked in the direction in which the trembling gloved hand was pointing yes he said smiling i see the gardener waiting for you i suppose he wants to ask you what flowers you wish to have on the table tonight how absurdly nervous you are my dear fellow you must come and see my doctor when we get back to town ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian heaved a sigh of relief as he saw the gardener approaching the man touched his hat glanced for a moment at lord henry in a hesitating manner and then produced a letter which he handed to his master her grace told me to wait for an answer he murmured ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i wish i could love cried dorian gray with a deep note of pathos in his voice but i seem to have lost the passion and forgotten the desire i am too much concentrated on myself my own personality has become a burden to me i want to escape to go away to forget it was silly of me to come down here at all i think i shall send a wire to harvey to have the yacht got ready on a yacht one is safe ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it is an annoying subject broke in lord henry it has no psychological value at all now if geoffrey had done the thing on purpose how interesting he would be i should like to know some one who had committed a real murder ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian drew himself up with an effort and smiled it is nothing duchess he murmured my nerves are dreadfully out of order that is all i am afraid i walked too far this morning i didnt hear what harry said was it very bad you must tell me some other time i think i must go and lie down you will excuse me wont you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
they had reached the great flight of steps that led from the conservatory on to the terrace as the glass door closed behind dorian lord henry turned and looked at the duchess with his slumberous eyes are you very much in love with him he asked ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
upstairs in his own room dorian gray was lying on a sofa with terror in every tingling fibre of his body life had suddenly become too hideous a burden for him to bear the dreadful death of the unlucky beater shot in the thicket like a wild animal had seemed to him to prefigure death for himself also he had nearly swooned at what lord henry had said in a chance mood of cynical jesting ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at five oclock he rang his bell for his servant and gave him orders to pack his things for the nightexpress to town and to have the brougham at the door by eightthirty he was determined not to sleep another night at selby royal it was an illomened place death walked there in the sunlight the grass of the forest had been spotted with blood ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
then he wrote a note to lord henry telling him that he was going up to town to consult his doctor and asking him to entertain his guests in his absence as he was putting it into the envelope a knock came to the door and his valet informed him that the headkeeper wished to see him he frowned and bit his lip send him in he muttered after some moments hesitation ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
in less than a quarter of an hour dorian gray was galloping down the long avenue as hard as he could go the trees seemed to sweep past him in spectral procession and wild shadows to fling themselves across his path once the mare swerved at a white gatepost and nearly threw him he lashed her across the neck with his crop she cleft the dusky air like an arrow the stones flew from her hoofs ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
at last he reached the home farm two men were loitering in the yard he leaped from the saddle and threw the reins to one of them in the farthest stable a light was glimmering something seemed to tell him that the body was there and he hurried to the door and put his hand upon the latch ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
on a heap of sacking in the far corner was lying the dead body of a man dressed in a coarse shirt and a pair of blue trousers a spotted handkerchief had been placed over the face a coarse candle stuck in a bottle sputtered beside it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear boy said lord henry smiling anybody can be good in the country there are no temptations there that is the reason why people who live out of town are so absolutely uncivilized civilization is not by any means an easy thing to attain to there are only two ways by which man can reach it one is by being cultured the other by being corrupt country people have no opportunity of being either so they stagnate ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
culture and corruption echoed dorian i have known something of both it seems terrible to me now that they should ever be found together for i have a new ideal harry i am going to alter i think i have altered ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
you have not yet told me what your good action was or did you say you had done more than one asked his companion as he spilled into his plate a little crimson pyramid of seeded strawberries and through a perforated shellshaped spoon snowed white sugar upon them ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i can tell you harry it is not a story i could tell to any one else i spared somebody it sounds vain but you understand what i mean she was quite beautiful and wonderfully like sibyl vane i think it was that which first attracted me to her you remember sibyl dont you how long ago that seems well hetty was not one of our own class of course she was simply a girl in a village but i really loved her i am quite sure that i loved her all during this wonderful may that we have been having i used to run down and see her two or three times a week yesterday she met me in a little orchard the appleblossoms kept tumbling down on her hair and she was laughing we were to have gone away together this morning at dawn suddenly i determined to leave her as flowerlike as i had found her ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i should think the novelty of the emotion must have given you a thrill of real pleasure dorian interrupted lord henry but i can finish your idyll for you you gave her good advice and broke her heart that was the beginning of your reformation ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
harry you are horrible you mustnt say these dreadful things hettys heart is not broken of course she cried and all that but there is no disgrace upon her she can live like perdita in her garden of mint and marigold ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
and weep over a faithless florizel said lord henry laughing as he leaned back in his chair my dear dorian you have the most curiously boyish moods do you think this girl will ever be really content now with any one of her own rank i suppose she will be married some day to a rough carter or a grinning ploughman well the fact of having met you and loved you will teach her to despise her husband and she will be wretched from a moral point of view i cannot say that i think much of your great renunciation even as a beginning it is poor besides how do you know that hetty isnt floating at the present moment in some starlit millpond with lovely waterlilies round her like ophelia ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i cant bear this harry you mock at everything and then suggest the most serious tragedies i am sorry i told you now i dont care what you say to me i know i was right in acting as i did poor hetty as i rode past the farm this morning i saw her white face at the window like a spray of jasmine dont let us talk about it any more and dont try to persuade me that the first good action i have done for years the first little bit of selfsacrifice i have ever known is really a sort of sin i want to be better i am going to be better tell me something about yourself what is going on in town i have not been to the club for days ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear boy they have only been talking about it for six weeks and the british public are really not equal to the mental strain of having more than one topic every three months they have been very fortunate lately however they have had my own divorcecase and alan campbells suicide now they have got the mysterious disappearance of an artist scotland yard still insists that the man in the grey ulster who left for paris by the midnight train on the ninth of november was poor basil and the french police declare that basil never arrived in paris at all i suppose in about a fortnight we shall be told that he has been seen in san francisco it is an odd thing but every one who disappears is said to be seen at san francisco it must be a delightful city and possess all the attractions of the next world ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
because said lord henry passing beneath his nostrils the gilt trellis of an open vinaigrette box one can survive everything nowadays except that death and vulgarity are the only two facts in the nineteenth century that one cannot explain away let us have our coffee in the musicroom dorian you must play chopin to me the man with whom my wife ran away played chopin exquisitely poor victoria i was very fond of her the house is rather lonely without her of course married life is merely a habit a bad habit but then one regrets the loss even of ones worst habits perhaps one regrets them the most they are such an essential part of ones personality ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian said nothing but rose from the table and passing into the next room sat down to the piano and let his fingers stray across the white and black ivory of the keys after the coffee had been brought in he stopped and looking over at lord henry said harry did it ever occur to you that basil was murdered ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
lord henry yawned basil was very popular and always wore a waterbury watch why should he have been murdered he was not clever enough to have enemies of course he had a wonderful genius for painting but a man can paint like velasquez and yet be as dull as possible basil was really rather dull he only interested me once and that was when he told me years ago that he had a wild adoration for you and that you were the dominant motive of his art ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh some of the papers do it does not seem to me to be at all probable i know there are dreadful places in paris but basil was not the sort of man to have gone to them he had no curiosity it was his chief defect ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i would say my dear fellow that you were posing for a character that doesnt suit you all crime is vulgar just as all vulgarity is crime it is not in you dorian to commit a murder i am sorry if i hurt your vanity by saying so but i assure you it is true crime belongs exclusively to the lower orders i dont blame them in the smallest degree i should fancy that crime was to them what art is to us simply a method of procuring extraordinary sensations ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
oh anything becomes a pleasure if one does it too often cried lord henry laughing that is one of the most important secrets of life i should fancy however that murder is always a mistake one should never do anything that one cannot talk about after dinner but let us pass from poor basil i wish i could believe that he had come to such a really romantic end as you suggest but i cant i dare say he fell into the seine off an omnibus and that the conductor hushed up the scandal yes i should fancy that was his end i see him lying now on his back under those dullgreen waters with the heavy barges floating over him and long weeds catching in his hair do you know i dont think he would have done much more good work during the last ten years his painting had gone off very much ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian heaved a sigh and lord henry strolled across the room and began to stroke the head of a curious java parrot a large greyplumaged bird with pink crest and tail that was balancing itself upon a bamboo perch as his pointed fingers touched it it dropped the white scurf of crinkled lids over black glasslike eyes and began to sway backwards and forwards ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes he continued turning round and taking his handkerchief out of his pocket his painting had quite gone off it seemed to me to have lost something it had lost an ideal when you and he ceased to be great friends he ceased to be a great artist what was it separated you i suppose he bored you if so he never forgave you its a habit bores have by the way what has become of that wonderful portrait he did of you i dont think i have ever seen it since he finished it oh i remember your telling me years ago that you had sent it down to selby and that it had got mislaid or stolen on the way you never got it back what a pity it was really a masterpiece i remember i wanted to buy it i wish i had now it belonged to basils best period since then his work was that curious mixture of bad painting and good intentions that always entitles a man to be called a representative british artist did you advertise for it you should ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
i forget said dorian i suppose i did but i never really liked it i am sorry i sat for it the memory of the thing is hateful to me why do you talk of it it used to remind me of those curious lines in some playhamlet i thinkhow do they run ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the elder man lay back and looked at him with halfclosed eyes by the way dorian he said after a pause what does it profit a man if he gain the whole world and losehow does the quotation runhis own soul ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear fellow said lord henry elevating his eyebrows in surprise i asked you because i thought you might be able to give me an answer that is all i was going through the park last sunday and close by the marble arch there stood a little crowd of shabbylooking people listening to some vulgar streetpreacher as i passed by i heard the man yelling out that question to his audience it struck me as being rather dramatic london is very rich in curious effects of that kind a wet sunday an uncouth christian in a mackintosh a ring of sickly white faces under a broken roof of dripping umbrellas and a wonderful phrase flung into the air by shrill hysterical lipsit was really very good in its way quite a suggestion i thought of telling the prophet that art had a soul but that man had not i am afraid however he would not have understood me ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
ah then it must be an illusion the things one feels absolutely certain about are never true that is the fatality of faith and the lesson of romance how grave you are dont be so serious what have you or i to do with the superstitions of our age no we have given up our belief in the soul play me something play me a nocturne dorian and as you play tell me in a low voice how you have kept your youth you must have some secret i am only ten years older than you are and i am wrinkled and worn and yellow you are really wonderful dorian you have never looked more charming than you do tonight you remind me of the day i saw you first you were rather cheeky very shy and absolutely extraordinary you have changed of course but not in appearance i wish you would tell me your secret to get back my youth i would do anything in the world except take exercise get up early or be respectable youth there is nothing like it its absurd to talk of the ignorance of youth the only people to whose opinions i listen now with any respect are people much younger than myself they seem in front of me life has revealed to them her latest wonder as for the aged i always contradict the aged i do it on principle if you ask them their opinion on something that happened yesterday they solemnly give you the opinions current in  when people wore high stocks believed in everything and knew absolutely nothing how lovely that thing you are playing is i wonder did chopin write it at majorca with the sea weeping round the villa and the salt spray dashing against the panes it is marvellously romantic what a blessing it is that there is one art left to us that is not imitative dont stop i want music tonight it seems to me that you are the young apollo and that i am marsyas listening to you i have sorrows dorian of my own that even you know nothing of the tragedy of old age is not that one is old but that one is young i am amazed sometimes at my own sincerity ah dorian how happy you are what an exquisite life you have had you have drunk deeply of everything you have crushed the grapes against your palate nothing has been hidden from you and it has all been to you no more than the sound of music it has not marred you you are still the same ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
yes you are the same i wonder what the rest of your life will be dont spoil it by renunciations at present you are a perfect type dont make yourself incomplete you are quite flawless now you need not shake your head you know you are besides dorian dont deceive yourself life is not governed by will or intention life is a question of nerves and fibres and slowly builtup cells in which thought hides itself and passion has its dreams you may fancy yourself safe and think yourself strong but a chance tone of colour in a room or a morning sky a particular perfume that you had once loved and that brings subtle memories with it a line from a forgotten poem that you had come across again a cadence from a piece of music that you had ceased to playi tell you dorian that it is on things like these that our lives depend browning writes about that somewhere but our own senses will imagine them for us there are moments when the odour of lilas blanc passes suddenly across me and i have to live the strangest month of my life over again i wish i could change places with you dorian the world has cried out against us both but it has always worshipped you it always will worship you you are the type of what the age is searching for and what it is afraid it has found i am so glad that you have never done anything never carved a statue or painted a picture or produced anything outside of yourself life has been your art you have set yourself to music your days are your sonnets ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
dorian rose up from the piano and passed his hand through his hair yes life has been exquisite he murmured but i am not going to have the same life harry and you must not say these extravagant things to me you dont know everything about me i think that if you did even you would turn from me you laugh dont laugh ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
why have you stopped playing dorian go back and give me the nocturne over again look at that great honeycoloured moon that hangs in the dusky air she is waiting for you to charm her and if you play she will come closer to the earth you wont let us go to the club then it has been a charming evening and we must end it charmingly there is some one at whites who wants immensely to know youyoung lord poole bournemouths eldest son he has already copied your neckties and has begged me to introduce him to you he is quite delightful and rather reminds me of you ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
my dear boy you are really beginning to moralize you will soon be going about like the converted and the revivalist warning people against all the sins of which you have grown tired you are much too delightful to do that besides it is no use you and i are what we are and will be what we will be as for being poisoned by a book there is no such thing as that art has no influence upon action it annihilates the desire to act it is superbly sterile the books that the world calls immoral are books that show the world its own shame that is all but we wont discuss literature come round tomorrow i am going to ride at eleven we might go together and i will take you to lunch afterwards with lady branksome she is a charming woman and wants to consult you about some tapestries she is thinking of buying mind you come or shall we lunch with our little duchess she says she never sees you now perhaps you are tired of gladys i thought you would be her clever tongue gets on ones nerves well in any case be here at eleven ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was a lovely night so warm that he threw his coat over his arm and did not even put his silk scarf round his throat as he strolled home smoking his cigarette two young men in evening dress passed him he heard one of them whisper to the other that is dorian gray he remembered how pleased he used to be when he was pointed out or stared at or talked about he was tired of hearing his own name now half the charm of the little village where he had been so often lately was that no one knew who he was he had often told the girl whom he had lured to love him that he was poor and she had believed him he had told her once that he was wicked and she had laughed at him and answered that wicked people were always very old and very ugly what a laugh she hadjust like a thrush singing and how pretty she had been in her cotton dresses and her large hats she knew nothing but she had everything that he had lost ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
was it really true that one could never change he felt a wild longing for the unstained purity of his boyhoodhis rosewhite boyhood as lord henry had once called it he knew that he had tarnished himself filled his mind with corruption and given horror to his fancy that he had been an evil influence to others and had experienced a terrible joy in being so and that of the lives that had crossed his own it had been the fairest and the most full of promise that he had brought to shame but was it all irretrievable was there no hope for him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
ah in what a monstrous moment of pride and passion he had prayed that the portrait should bear the burden of his days and he keep the unsullied splendour of eternal youth all his failure had been due to that better for him that each sin of his life had brought its sure swift penalty along with it there was purification in punishment not forgive us our sins but smite us for our iniquities should be the prayer of man to a most just god ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
the curiously carved mirror that lord henry had given to him so many years ago now was standing on the table and the whitelimbed cupids laughed round it as of old he took it up as he had done on that night of horror when he had first noted the change in the fatal picture and with wild teardimmed eyes looked into its polished shield once some one who had terribly loved him had written to him a mad letter ending with these idolatrous words the world is changed because you are made of ivory and gold the curves of your lips rewrite history the phrases came back to his memory and he repeated them over and over to himself then he loathed his own beauty and flinging the mirror on the floor crushed it into silver splinters beneath his heel it was his beauty that had ruined him his beauty and the youth that he had prayed for but for those two things his life might have been free from stain his beauty had been to him but a mask his youth but a mockery what was youth at best a green an unripe time a time of shallow moods and sickly thoughts why had he worn its livery youth had spoiled him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
it was better not to think of the past nothing could alter that it was of himself and of his own future that he had to think james vane was hidden in a nameless grave in selby churchyard alan campbell had shot himself one night in his laboratory but had not revealed the secret that he had been forced to know the excitement such as it was over basil hallwards disappearance would soon pass away it was already waning he was perfectly safe there nor indeed was it the death of basil hallward that weighed most upon his mind it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him basil had painted the portrait that had marred his life he could not forgive him that it was the portrait that had done everything basil had said things to him that were unbearable and that he had yet borne with patience the murder had been simply the madness of a moment as for alan campbell his suicide had been his own act he had chosen to do it it was nothing to him ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
as he thought of hetty merton he began to wonder if the portrait in the locked room had changed surely it was not still so horrible as it had been perhaps if his life became pure he would be able to expel every sign of evil passion from the face perhaps the signs of evil had already gone away he would go and look ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he took the lamp from the table and crept upstairs as he unbarred the door a smile of joy flitted across his strangely younglooking face and lingered for a moment about his lips yes he would be good and the hideous thing that he had hidden away would no longer be a terror to him he felt as if the load had been lifted from him already ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he went in quietly locking the door behind him as was his custom and dragged the purple hanging from the portrait a cry of pain and indignation broke from him he could see no change save that in the eyes there was a look of cunning and in the mouth the curved wrinkle of the hypocrite the thing was still loathsomemore loathsome if possible than beforeand the scarlet dew that spotted the hand seemed brighter and more like blood newly spilled then he trembled had it been merely vanity that had made him do his one good deed or the desire for a new sensation as lord henry had hinted with his mocking laugh or that passion to act a part that sometimes makes us do things finer than we are ourselves or perhaps all these and why was the red stain larger than it had been it seemed to have crept like a horrible disease over the wrinkled fingers there was blood on the painted feet as though the thing had drippedblood even on the hand that had not held the knife confess did it mean that he was to confess to give himself up and be put to death he laughed he felt that the idea was monstrous besides even if he did confess who would believe him there was no trace of the murdered man anywhere everything belonging to him had been destroyed he himself had burned what had been belowstairs the world would simply say that he was mad they would shut him up if he persisted in his story yet it was his duty to confess to suffer public shame and to make public atonement there was a god who called upon men to tell their sins to earth as well as to heaven nothing that he could do would cleanse him till he had told his own sin his sin he shrugged his shoulders the death of basil hallward seemed very little to him he was thinking of hetty merton for it was an unjust mirror this mirror of his soul that he was looking at vanity curiosity hypocrisy had there been nothing more in his renunciation than that there had been something more at least he thought so but who could tell  no there had been nothing more through vanity he had spared her in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness for curiositys sake he had tried the denial of self he recognized that now ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
but this murderwas it to dog him all his life was he always to be burdened by his past was he really to confess never there was only one bit of evidence left against him the picture itselfthat was evidence he would destroy it why had he kept it so long once it had given him pleasure to watch it changing and growing old of late he had felt no such pleasure it had kept him awake at night when he had been away he had been filled with terror lest other eyes should look upon it it had brought melancholy across his passions its mere memory had marred many moments of joy it had been like conscience to him yes it had been conscience he would destroy it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
he looked round and saw the knife that had stabbed basil hallward he had cleaned it many times till there was no stain left upon it it was bright and glistened as it had killed the painter so it would kill the painters work and all that that meant it would kill the past and when that was dead he would be free it would kill this monstrous soullife and without its hideous warnings he would be at peace he seized the thing and stabbed the picture with it ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
there was a cry heard and a crash the cry was so horrible in its agony that the frightened servants woke and crept out of their rooms two gentlemen who were passing in the square below stopped and looked up at the great house they walked on till they met a policeman and brought him back the man rang the bell several times but there was no answer except for a light in one of the top windows the house was all dark after a time he went away and stood in an adjoining portico and watched ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
after about a quarter of an hour he got the coachman and one of the footmen and crept upstairs they knocked but there was no reply they called out everything was still finally after vainly trying to force the door they got on the roof and dropped down on to the balcony the windows yielded easilytheir bolts were old ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
when they entered they found hanging upon the wall a splendid portrait of their master as they had last seen him in all the wonder of his exquisite youth and beauty lying on the floor was a dead man in evening dress with a knife in his heart he was withered wrinkled and loathsome of visage it was not till they had examined the rings that they recognized who it was ,The Picture of Dorian Gray
torvald helmer nora his wife doctor rank mrs linde nils krogstad helmers three young children anne their nurse a housemaid a porter ,A Dolls House

a bell rings in the hall shortly afterwards the door is heard to open enter nora humming a tune and in high spirits she is in outdoor dress and carries a number of parcels these she lays on the table to the right she leaves the outer door open after her and through it is seen a porter who is carrying a christmas tree and a basket which he gives to the maid who has opened the door ,A Dolls House
nora hide the christmas tree carefully helen be sure the children do not see it until this evening when it is dressed to the porter taking out her purse how much ,A Dolls House
nora there is a shilling no keep the change the porter thanks her and goes out nora shuts the door she is laughing to herself as she takes off her hat and coat she takes a packet of macaroons from her pocket and eats one or two then goes cautiously to her husbands door and listens yes he is in still humming she goes to the table on the right ,A Dolls House
helmer dont disturb me a little later he opens the door and looks into the room pen in hand bought did you say all these things has my little spendthrift been wasting money again ,A Dolls House
nora yes torvald we may be a wee bit more reckless now maynt we just a tiny wee bit you are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots of money ,A Dolls House

helmer that is like a woman but seriously nora you know what i think about that no debt no borrowing there can be no freedom or beauty about a home life that depends on borrowing and debt we two have kept bravely on the straight road so far and we will go on the same way for the short time longer that there need be any struggle ,A Dolls House
helmer following her come come my little skylark must not droop her wings what is this is my little squirrel out of temper taking out his purse nora what do you think i have got here ,A Dolls House

nora speaking quickly you might give me money torvald only just as much as you can afford and then one of these days i will buy something with it ,A Dolls House
nora oh do dear torvald please please do then i will wrap it up in beautiful gilt paper and hang it on the christmas tree wouldnt that be fun ,A Dolls House
nora spendthriftsi know let us do as you suggest torvald and then i shall have time to think what i am most in want of that is a very sensible plan isnt it ,A Dolls House
helmer smiling indeed it isthat is to say if you were really to save out of the money i give you and then really buy something for yourself but if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number of unnecessary things then i merely have to pay up again ,A Dolls House
helmer you cant deny it my dear little nora puts his arm round her waist its a sweet little spendthrift but she uses up a deal of money one would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are ,A Dolls House
helmer you are an odd little soul very like your father you always find some new way of wheedling money out of me and as soon as you have got it it seems to melt in your hands you never know where it has gone still one must take you as you are it is in the blood for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things nora ,A Dolls House
helmer and i would not wish you to be anything but just what you are my sweet little skylark but do you know it strikes me that you are looking ratherwhat shall i sayrather uneasy today ,A Dolls House
helmer no i am sure of that besides you gave me your word going up to her keep your little christmas secrets to yourself my darling they will all be revealed tonight when the christmas tree is lit no doubt ,A Dolls House
helmer no but there is no need as a matter of course he will come to dinner with us however i will ask him when he comes in this morning i have ordered some good wine nora you cant think how i am looking forward to this evening ,A Dolls House
helmer do you remember last christmas for a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight making ornaments for the christmas tree and all the other fine things that were to be a surprise to us it was the dullest three weeks i ever spent ,A Dolls House
helmer of course you couldnt poor little girl you had the best of intentions to please us all and thats the main thing but it is a good thing that our hard times are over ,A Dolls House
nora clapping her hands no torvald i neednt any longer need i its wonderfully lovely to hear you say so taking his arm now i will tell you how i have been thinking we ought to arrange things torvald as soon as christmas is overa bell rings in the hall theres the bell she tidies the room a little theres some one at the door what a nuisance ,A Dolls House
nora is it so long since we met i suppose it is the last eight years have been a happy time for me i can tell you and so now you have come into the town and have taken this long journey in winterthat was plucky of you ,A Dolls House
nora to have some fun at christmastime of course how delightful we will have such fun together but take off your things you are not cold i hope helps her now we will sit down by the stove and be cosy no take this armchair i will sit here in the rockingchair takes her hands now you look like your old self again it was only the first momentyou are a little paler christine and perhaps a little thinner ,A Dolls House
nora perhaps a little older very very little certainly not much stops suddenly and speaks seriously what a thoughtless creature i am chattering away like this my poor dear christine do forgive me ,A Dolls House
nora yes i knew i saw it in the papers i assure you christine i meant ever so often to write to you at the time but i always put it off and something always prevented me ,A Dolls House
nora so you are quite alone how dreadfully sad that must be i have three lovely children you cant see them just now for they are out with their nurse but now you must tell me all about it ,A Dolls House
nora no you must begin i mustnt be selfish today today i must only think of your affairs but there is one thing i must tell you do you know we have just had a great piece of good luck ,A Dolls House
nora yes tremendous a barristers profession is such an uncertain thing especially if he wont undertake unsavoury cases and naturally torvald has never been willing to do that and i quite agree with him you may imagine how pleased we are he is to take up his work in the bank at the new year and then he will have a big salary and lots of commissions for the future we can live quite differentlywe can do just as we like i feel so relieved and so happy christine it will be splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety wont it ,A Dolls House
nora laughing yes that is what torvald says now wags her finger at her but nora nora is not so silly as you think we have not been in a position for me to waste money we have both had to work ,A Dolls House
nora yes odds and ends needlework crotchetwork embroidery and that kind of thing dropping her voice and other things as well you know torvald left his office when we were married there was no prospect of promotion there and he had to try and earn more than before but during the first year he overworked himself dreadfully you see he had to make money every way he could and he worked early and late but he couldnt stand it and fell dreadfully ill and the doctors said it was necessary for him to go south ,A Dolls House
nora yes it was no easy matter to get away i can tell you it was just after ivar was born but naturally we had to go it was a wonderfully beautiful journey and it saved torvalds life but it cost a tremendous lot of money christine ,A Dolls House
nora yes and just think of it i couldnt go and nurse him i was expecting little ivars birth every day and i had my poor sick torvald to look after my dear kind fatheri never saw him again christine that was the saddest time i have known since our marriage ,A Dolls House
nora yes that was doctor rank but he doesnt come here professionally he is our greatest friend and comes in at least once every day no torvald has not had an hours illness since then and our children are strong and healthy and so am i jumps up and claps her hands christine christine its good to be alive and happybut how horrid of me i am talking of nothing but my own affairs sits on a stool near her and rests her arms on her knees you mustnt be angry with me tell me is it really true that you did not love your husband why did you marry him ,A Dolls House
mrs linde my mother was alive then and was bedridden and helpless and i had to provide for my two younger brothers so i did not think i was justified in refusing his offer ,A Dolls House
mrs linde well i had to turn my hand to anything i could findfirst a small shop then a small school and so on the last three years have seemed like one long workingday with no rest now it is at an end nora my poor mother needs me no more for she is gone and the boys do not need me either they have got situations and can shift for themselves ,A Dolls House
mrs linde no indeed i only feel my life unspeakably empty no one to live for anymore gets up restlessly that was why i could not stand the life in my little backwater any longer i hope it may be easier here to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts if only i could have the good luck to get some regular workoffice work of some kind ,A Dolls House
mrs linde going up to her it is you that must not be angry with me dear the worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter no one to work for and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances one must live and so one becomes selfish when you told me of the happy turn your fortunes have takenyou will hardly believe iti was delighted not so much on your account as on my own ,A Dolls House
nora he must christine just leave it to me i will broach the subject very cleverlyi will think of something that will please him very much it will make me so happy to be of some use to you ,A Dolls House
nora you look down upon me altogether christinebut you ought not to you are proud arent you of having worked so hard and so long for your mother ,A Dolls House
mrs linde indeed i dont look down on anyone but it is true that i am both proud and glad to think that i was privileged to make the end of my mothers life almost free from care ,A Dolls House
nora come here pulls her down on the sofa beside her now i will show you that i too have something to be proud and glad of it was i who saved torvalds life ,A Dolls House
nora there is no need you should i never said i had borrowed the money i may have got it some other way lies back on the sofa perhaps i got it from some other admirer when anyone is as attractive as i am ,A Dolls House
nora but it was absolutely necessary that he should not know my goodness cant you understand that it was necessary he should have no idea what a dangerous condition he was in it was to me that the doctors came and said that his life was in danger and that the only thing to save him was to live in the south do you suppose i didnt try first of all to get what i wanted as if it were for myself i told him how much i should love to travel abroad like other young wives i tried tears and entreaties with him i told him that he ought to remember the condition i was in and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me i even hinted that he might raise a loan that nearly made him angry christine he said i was thoughtless and that it was his duty as my husband not to indulge me in my whims and capricesas i believe he called them very well i thought you must be savedand that was how i came to devise a way out of the difficulty ,A Dolls House
nora no never papa died just at that time i had meant to let him into the secret and beg him never to reveal it but he was so ill thenalas there never was any need to tell him ,A Dolls House
nora good heavens no how could you think so a man who has such strong opinions about these things and besides how painful and humiliating it would be for torvald with his manly independence to know that he owed me anything it would upset our mutual relations altogether our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now ,A Dolls House
nora meditatively and with a half smile yessomeday perhaps after many years when i am no longer as nicelooking as i am now dont laugh at me i mean of course when torvald is no longer as devoted to me as he is now when my dancing and dressingup and reciting have palled on him then it may be a good thing to have something in reservebreaking off what nonsense that time will never come now what do you think of my great secret christine do you still think i am of no use i can tell you too that this affair has caused me a lot of worry it has been by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually i may tell you that there is something that is called in business quarterly interest and another thing called payment in installments and it is always so dreadfully difficult to manage them i have had to save a little here and there where i could you understand i have not been able to put aside much from my housekeeping money for torvald must have a good table i couldnt let my children be shabbily dressed i have felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them the sweet little darlings ,A Dolls House
nora of course besides i was the one responsible for it whenever torvald has given me money for new dresses and such things i have never spent more than half of it i have always bought the simplest and cheapest things thank heaven any clothes look well on me and so torvald has never noticed it but it was often very hard on me christinebecause it is delightful to be really well dressed isnt it ,A Dolls House
nora well then i have found other ways of earning money last winter i was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do so i locked myself up and sat writing every evening until quite late at night many a time i was desperately tired but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to sit there working and earning money it was like being a man ,A Dolls House
nora i cant tell you exactly you see it is very difficult to keep an account of a business matter of that kind i only know that i have paid every penny that i could scrape together many a time i was at my wits end smiles then i used to sit here and imagine that a rich old gentleman had fallen in love with me ,A Dolls House
nora be quietthat he had died and that when his will was opened it contained written in big letters the instruction the lovely mrs nora helmer is to have all i possess paid over to her at once in cash ,A Dolls House
nora good gracious cant you understand there was no old gentleman at all it was only something that i used to sit here and imagine when i couldnt think of any way of procuring money but its all the same now the tiresome old person can stay where he is as far as i am concerned i dont care about him or his will either for i am free from care now jumps up my goodness its delightful to think of christine free from care to be able to be free from care quite free from care to be able to play and romp with the children to be able to keep the house beautifully and have everything just as torvald likes it and think of it soon the spring will come and the big blue sky perhaps we shall be able to take a little tripperhaps i shall see the sea again oh its a wonderful thing to be alive and be happy a bell is heard in the hall ,A Dolls House
nora be so good as to go into the study then she bows indifferently to him and shuts the door into the hall then comes back and makes up the fire in the stove ,A Dolls House
doctor rank comes out of helmers study before he shuts the door he calls to him no my dear fellow i wont disturb you i would rather go in to your wife for a little while shuts the door and sees mrs linde i beg your pardon i am afraid i am disturbing you too ,A Dolls House
rank certainly however wretched i may feel i want to prolong the agony as long as possible all my patients are like that and so are those who are morally diseased one of them and a bad case too is at this very moment with helmer ,A Dolls House
rank a lawyer of the name of krogstad a fellow you dont know at all he suffers from a diseased moral character mrs helmer but even he began talking of its being highly important that he should live ,A Dolls House
rank yes he has some sort of appointment there to mrs linde i dont know whether you find also in your part of the world that there are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral corruption and as soon as they have found some put the person concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on him healthy natures are left out in the cold ,A Dolls House
nora what do i care about tiresome society i am laughing at something quite different something extremely amusing tell me doctor rank are all the people who are employed in the bank dependent on torvald now ,A Dolls House
nora smiling and humming thats my affair walking about the room its perfectly glorious to think that we havethat torvald has so much power over so many people takes the packet from her pocket doctor rank what do you say to a macaroon ,A Dolls House
nora oh well dont be alarmed you couldnt know that torvald had forbidden them i must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my teeth but bahonce in a waythats so isnt it doctor rank by your leave puts a macaroon into his mouth you must have one too christine and i shall have one just a little oneor at most two walking about i am tremendously happy there is just one thing in the world now that i should dearly love to do ,A Dolls House
nora christine is tremendously clever at bookkeeping and she is frightfully anxious to work under some clever man so as to perfect herself ,A Dolls House
nora and when she heard you had been appointed manager of the bankthe news was telegraphed you knowshe travelled here as quick as she could torvald i am sure you will be able to do something for christine for my sake wont you ,A Dolls House
nora goodbye for the present of course you will come back this evening and you too dr rank what do you say if you are well enough oh you must be wrap yourself up well they go to the door all talking together childrens voices are heard on the staircase ,A Dolls House
nora there they are there they are she runs to open the door the nurse comes in with the children come in come in stoops and kisses them oh you sweet blessings look at them christine arent they darlings ,A Dolls House

nora with meto the children gently go in to nurse what no the strange man wont do mother any harm when he has gone we will have another game she takes the children into the room on the left and shuts the door after them you want to speak to me ,A Dolls House
krogstad are you so you know all about it i thought as much then i can ask you without beating about the bushis mrs linde to have an appointment in the bank ,A Dolls House
nora what right have you to question me mr krogstadyou one of my husbands subordinates but since you ask you shall know yes mrs linde is to have an appointment and it was i who pleaded her cause mr krogstad let me tell you that ,A Dolls House
nora walking up and down the stage sometimes one has a tiny little bit of influence i should hope because one is a woman it does not necessarily follow that when anyone is in a subordinate position mr krogstad they should really be careful to avoid offending anyone whowho ,A Dolls House
krogstad oh there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of ignorance i can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me and i quite understand too whom i have to thank for being turned off ,A Dolls House
nora naturally i did not mean you to put that construction on it i what should make you think i have any influence of that kind with my husband ,A Dolls House
krogstad controlling himself listen to me mrs helmer if necessary i am prepared to fight for my small post in the bank as if i were fighting for my life ,A Dolls House
krogstad it is not only for the sake of the money indeed that weighs least with me in the matter there is another reasonwell i may as well tell you my position is this i daresay you know like everybody else that once many years ago i was guilty of an indiscretion ,A Dolls House
krogstad the matter never came into court but every way seemed to be closed to me after that so i took to the business that you know of i had to do something and honestly i dont think ive been one of the worst but now i must cut myself free from all that my sons are growing up for their sake i must try and win back as much respect as i can in the town this post in the bank was like the first step up for meand now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud ,A Dolls House
nora it would be perfectly infamous of you sobbing to think of his learning my secret which has been my joy and pride in such an ugly clumsy waythat he should learn it from you and it would put me in a horribly disagreeable position ,A Dolls House
nora impetuously well do it thenand it will be the worse for you my husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are and you certainly wont keep your post then ,A Dolls House
krogstad coming a step nearer listen to me mrs helmer either you have a very bad memory or you know very little of business i shall be obliged to remind you of a few details ,A Dolls House
krogstad i promised to get you that amount on certain conditions your mind was so taken up with your husbands illness and you were so anxious to get the money for your journey that you seem to have paid no attention to the conditions of our bargain therefore it will not be amiss if i remind you of them now i promised to get the money on the security of a bond which i drew up ,A Dolls House
krogstad good but below your signature there were a few lines constituting your father a surety for the money those lines your father should have signed ,A Dolls House
krogstad i had left the date blank that is to say your father should himself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper do you remember that ,A Dolls House
krogstad and you naturally did so at once because five or six days afterwards you brought me the bond with your fathers signature and then i gave you the money ,A Dolls House
krogstad that is correct i have ascertained it for myself and as that is so there is a discrepancy taking a paper from his pocket which i cannot account for ,A Dolls House
krogstad your father died on the th of september but look here your father has dated his signature the nd of october it is a discrepancy isnt it nora is silent can you explain it to me nora is still silent it is a remarkable thing too that the words nd of october as well as the year are not written in your fathers handwriting but in one that i think i know well of course it can be explained your father may have forgotten to date his signature and someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death there is no harm in that it all depends on the signature of the name and that is genuine i suppose mrs helmer it was your father himself who signed his name here ,A Dolls House
nora it was impossible papa was so ill if i had asked him for his signature i should have had to tell him what the money was to be used for and when he was so ill himself i couldnt tell him that my husbands life was in dangerit was impossible ,A Dolls House
nora i couldnt take that into account i didnt trouble myself about you at all i couldnt bear you because you put so many heartless difficulties in my way although you knew what a dangerous condition my husband was in ,A Dolls House
krogstad mrs helmer you evidently do not realise clearly what it is that you have been guilty of but i can assure you that my one false step which lost me all my reputation was nothing more or nothing worse than what you have done ,A Dolls House
nora i dont believe it is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her dying father anxiety and care is a wife not to be allowed to save her husbands life i dont know much about law but i am certain that there must be laws permitting such things as that have you no knowledge of such lawsyou who are a lawyer you must be a very poor lawyer mr krogstad ,A Dolls House
krogstad maybe but matters of businesssuch business as you and i have had togetherdo you think i dont understand that very well do as you please but let me tell you thisif i lose my position a second time you shall lose yours with me he bows and goes out through the hall ,A Dolls House
nora appears buried in thought for a short time then tosses her head nonsense trying to frighten me like thati am not so silly as he thinks begins to busy herself putting the childrens things in order and yet no its impossible i did it for loves sake ,A Dolls House
nora yes but i cant now run away in i have such a lot to do run away in my sweet little darlings she gets them into the room by degrees and shuts the door on them then sits down on the sofa takes up a piece of needlework and sews a few stitches but soon stops no throws down the work gets up goes to the hall door and calls out helen bring the tree in goes to the table on the left opens a drawer and stops again no no it is quite impossible ,A Dolls House
nora begins dressing the tree a candle hereand flowers herethe horrible man its all nonsensetheres nothing wrong the tree shall be splendid i will do everything i can think of to please you torvaldi will sing for you dance for youhelmer comes in with some papers under his arm oh are you back already ,A Dolls House
helmer and you were to appear to do it of your own accord you were to conceal from me the fact of his having been here didnt he beg that of you too ,A Dolls House
helmer nora nora and you would be a party to that sort of thing to have any talk with a man like that and give him any sort of promise and to tell me a lie into the bargain ,A Dolls House
helmer didnt you tell me no one had been here shakes his finger at her my little songbird must never do that again a songbird must have a clean beak to chirp withno false notes puts his arm round her waist that is so isnt it yes i am sure it is lets her go we will say no more about it sits down by the stove how warm and snug it is here turns over his papers ,A Dolls House
helmer i have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake the necessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work and i must make use of the christmas week for that so as to have everything in order for the new year ,A Dolls House
nora leans against the back of his chair and strokes his hair if you hadnt been so busy i should have asked you a tremendously big favour torvald ,A Dolls House
nora there is no one has such good taste as you and i do so want to look nice at the fancydress ball torvald couldnt you take me in hand and decide what i shall go as and what sort of a dress i shall wear ,A Dolls House
nora that is nice of you goes to the christmas tree a short pause how pretty the red flowers look but tell me was it really something very bad that this krogstad was guilty of ,A Dolls House
helmer yes or as in so many cases by imprudence i am not so heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step of that kind ,A Dolls House
helmer just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play the hypocrite with every one how he has to wear a mask in the presence of those near and dear to him even before his own wife and children and about the childrenthat is the most terrible part of it all nora ,A Dolls House
helmer because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole life of a home each breath the children take in such a house is full of the germs of evil ,A Dolls House
helmer my dear i have often seen it in the course of my life as a lawyer almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a deceitful mother ,A Dolls House
helmer it seems most commonly to be the mothers influence though naturally a bad fathers would have the same result every lawyer is familiar with the fact this krogstad now has been persistently poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation that is why i say he has lost all moral character holds out his hands to her that is why my sweet little nora must promise me not to plead his cause give me your hand on it come come what is this give me your hand there now thats settled i assure you it would be quite impossible for me to work with him i literally feel physically ill when i am in the company of such people ,A Dolls House
helmer getting up and putting his papers in order yes and i must try and read through some of these before dinner and i must think about your costume too and it is just possible i may have something ready in gold paper to hang up on the tree puts his hand on her head my precious little singingbird he goes into his room and shuts the door after him ,A Dolls House
nora pale with terror deprave my little children poison my home a short pause then she tosses her head its not true it cant possibly be true ,A Dolls House
the same scenethe christmas tree is in the corner by the piano stripped of its ornaments and with burntdown candleends on its dishevelled branches noras cloak and hat are lying on the sofa she is alone in the room walking about uneasily she stops by the sofa and takes up her cloak ,A Dolls House
nora drops her cloak someone is coming now goes to the door and listens noit is no one of course no one will come today christmas daynor tomorrow either but perhapsopens the door and looks out no nothing in the letterbox it is quite empty comes forward what rubbish of course he cant be in earnest about it such a thing couldnt happen it is impossiblei have three little children ,A Dolls House
nurse what when i was going to get such a good place by it a poor girl who has got into trouble should be glad to besides that wicked man didnt do a single thing for me ,A Dolls House
nora and if my little ones had no other mother i am sure you wouldwhat nonsense i am talking opens the box go in to them now i must you will see tomorrow how charming i shall look ,A Dolls House
nora begins to unpack the box but soon pushes it away from her if only i dared go out if only no one would come if only i could be sure nothing would happen here in the meantime stuff and nonsense no one will come only i mustnt think about it i will brush my muff what lovely lovely gloves out of my thoughts out of my thoughts one two three four five six screams ah there is someone coming makes a movement towards the door but stands irresolute ,A Dolls House
nora yes i was passing by as a matter of fact it is something you could help me with let us sit down here on the sofa look here tomorrow evening there is to be a fancydress ball at the stenborgs who live above us and torvald wants me to go as a neapolitan fishergirl and dance the tarantella that i learned at capri ,A Dolls House
mrs linde sewing so you are going to be dressed up tomorrow nora i will tell you whati shall come in for a moment and see you in your fine feathers but i have completely forgotten to thank you for a delightful evening yesterday ,A Dolls House
nora gets up and crosses the stage well i dont think yesterday was as pleasant as usual you ought to have come to town a little earlier christine certainly torvald does understand how to make a house dainty and attractive ,A Dolls House
mrs linde and so do you it seems to me you are not your fathers daughter for nothing but tell me is doctor rank always as depressed as he was yesterday ,A Dolls House
nora no yesterday it was very noticeable i must tell you that he suffers from a very dangerous disease he has consumption of the spine poor creature his father was a horrible man who committed all sorts of excesses and that is why his son was sickly from childhood do you understand ,A Dolls House
nora walking about pooh when you have three children you get visits now and then fromfrom married women who know something of medical matters and they talk about one thing and another ,A Dolls House
mrs linde when you introduced him to me yesterday he declared he had often heard my name mentioned in this house but afterwards i noticed that your husband hadnt the slightest idea who i was so how could doctor rank ,A Dolls House
nora that is quite right christine torvald is so absurdly fond of me that he wants me absolutely to himself as he says at first he used to seem almost jealous if i mentioned any of the dear folk at home so naturally i gave up doing so but i often talk about such things with doctor rank because he likes hearing about them ,A Dolls House
mrs linde listen to me nora you are still very like a child in many things and i am older than you in many ways and have a little more experience let me tell you thisyou ought to make an end of it with doctor rank ,A Dolls House
nora are you out of your senses how can you think of such a thing a friend of ours who comes here everyday do you realise what a horribly painful position that would be ,A Dolls House
nora no certainly not it would never have entered into my head for a moment besides he had no money to lend then he came into his money afterwards ,A Dolls House
nora going nearer to her christine listens hush theres torvald come home do you mind going in to the children for the present torvald cant bear to see dressmaking going on let anne help you ,A Dolls House
mrs linde gathering some of the things together certainlybut i am not going away from here until we have had it out with one another she goes into the room on the left as helmer comes in from the hall ,A Dolls House
helmer nicebecause you do as your husband wishes well well you little rogue i am sure you did not mean it in that way but i am not going to disturb you you will want to be trying on your dress i expect ,A Dolls House
nora that isnt the reason torvald it is for your own sake this fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers you have told me so yourself he can do you an unspeakable amount of harm i am frightened to death of him ,A Dolls House
nora yesyes of course just recall to your mind what these malicious creatures wrote in the papers about papa and how horribly they slandered him i believe they would have procured his dismissal if the department had not sent you over to inquire into it and if you had not been so kindly disposed and helpful to him ,A Dolls House
helmer my little nora there is an important difference between your father and me your fathers reputation as a public official was not above suspicion mine is and i hope it will continue to be so as long as i hold my office ,A Dolls House
nora you never can tell what mischief these men may contrive we ought to be so well off so snug and happy here in our peaceful home and have no caresyou and i and the children torvald that is why i beg you so earnestly ,A Dolls House
helmer and it is just by interceding for him that you make it impossible for me to keep him it is already known at the bank that i mean to dismiss krogstad is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wifes bidding ,A Dolls House
helmer of courseif only this obstinate little person can get her way do you suppose i am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole staff to let people think that i am a man to be swayed by all sorts of outside influence i should very soon feel the consequences of it i can tell you and besides there is one thing that makes it quite impossible for me to have krogstad in the bank as long as i am manager ,A Dolls House
helmer and i hear he is a good worker too but i knew him when we were boys it was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an incubus in afterlife i may as well tell you plainly we were once on very intimate terms with one another but this tactless fellow lays no restraint on himself when other people are present on the contrary he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me and every minute it is i say helmer old fellow and that sort of thing i assure you it is extremely painful for me he would make my position in the bank intolerable ,A Dolls House
helmer its the same thing you say my point of view is narrowminded so i must be so too narrowminded very welli must put an end to this goes to the hall door and calls helen ,A Dolls House
helmer looking among his papers settle it enter maid look here take this letter and go downstairs with it at once find a messenger and tell him to deliver it and be quick the address is on it and here is the money ,A Dolls House
nora call her back torvald there is still time oh torvald call her back do it for my sakefor your own sakefor the childrens sake do you hear me torvald call her back you dont know what that letter can bring upon us ,A Dolls House
helmer my dear nora i can forgive the anxiety you are in although really it is an insult to me it is indeed isnt it an insult to think that i should be afraid of a starving quilldrivers vengeance but i forgive you nevertheless because it is such eloquent witness to your great love for me takes her in his arms and that is as it should be my own darling nora come what will you may be sure i shall have both courage and strength if they be needed you will see i am man enough to take everything upon myself ,A Dolls House
helmer thats right well we will share it nora as man and wife should that is how it shall be caressing her are you content now there therenot these frightened doves eyes the whole thing is only the wildest fancynow you must go and play through the tarantella and practise with your tambourine i shall go into the inner office and shut the door and i shall hear nothing you can make as much noise as you please turns back at the door and when rank comes tell him where he will find me nods to her takes his papers and goes into his room and shuts the door after him ,A Dolls House
nora bewildered with anxiety stands as if rooted to the spot and whispers he was capable of doing it he will do it he will do it in spite of everythingno not that never never anything rather than that oh for some help some way out of it the doorbell rings doctor rank anything rather than thatanything whatever it is she puts her hands over her face pulls herself together goes to the door and opens it rank is standing without hanging up his coat during the following dialogue it begins to grow dark ,A Dolls House
rank who else it is no use lying to ones self i am the most wretched of all my patients mrs helmer lately i have been taking stock of my internal economy bankrupt probably within a month i shall lie rotting in the churchyard ,A Dolls House
rank the thing itself is cursedly ugly and the worst of it is that i shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that i shall only make one more examination of myself when i have done that i shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will begin there is something i want to tell you helmers refined nature gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly i wont have him in my sickroom ,A Dolls House
rank i wont have him there not on any account i bar my door to him as soon as i am quite certain that the worst has come i shall send you my card with a black cross on it and then you will know that the loathsome end has begun ,A Dolls House
rank with death stalking beside meto have to pay this penalty for another mans sin is there any justice in that and in every single family in one way or another some such inexorable retribution is being exacted ,A Dolls House
nora she has only come to sew my dress for me bless my soul how unreasonable you are sits down on the sofa be nice now doctor rank and tomorrow you will see how beautifully i shall dance and you can imagine i am doing it all for youand for torvald too of course takes various things out of the box doctor rank come and sit down here and i will show you something ,A Dolls House
nora fleshcoloured arent they lovely it is so dark here now but tomorrow no no no you must only look at the feet oh well you may have leave to look at the legs too ,A Dolls House
rank after a short silence when i am sitting here talking to you as intimately as this i cannot imagine for a moment what would have become of me if i had never come into this house ,A Dolls House
rank as before and not be able to leave behind one the slightest token of ones gratitude scarcely even a fleeting regretnothing but an empty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other ,A Dolls House
nora more than anyone else i know you are my truest and best friend and so i will tell you what it is well doctor rank it is something you must help me to prevent you know how devotedly how inexpressibly deeply torvald loves me he would never for a moment hesitate to give his life for me ,A Dolls House
rank i was determined you should know it before i went away and there will never be a better opportunity than this now you know it nora and now you know too that you can trust me as you would trust no one else ,A Dolls House
rank what do you mean did you know maid enters with lamp puts it down on the table and goes out noramrs helmertell me had you any idea of this ,A Dolls House
nora oh how do i know whether i had or whether i hadnt i really cant tell youto think you could be so clumsy doctor rank we were getting on so nicely ,A Dolls House
nora you can do nothing for me now besides i really dont need any help at all you will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my part it really is soof course it is sits down in the rockingchair and looks at him with a smile you are a nice sort of man doctor rankdont you feel ashamed of yourself now the lamp has come ,A Dolls House
rank it is just that that put me on the wrong track you are a riddle to me i have often thought that you would almost as soon be in my company as in helmers ,A Dolls House
nora when i was at home of course i loved papa best but i always thought it tremendous fun if i could steal down into the maids room because they never moralised at all and talked to each other about such entertaining things ,A Dolls House
nora jumping up and going to him oh dear nice doctor rank i never meant that at all but surely you can understand that being with torvald is a little like being with papaenter maid from the hall ,A Dolls House
nora this dreadful thing is going to happen it will happen in spite of me no no no it cant happenit shant happen she bolts the door of helmers room the maid opens the hall door for krogstad and shuts it after him he is wearing a fur coat high boots and a fur cap ,A Dolls House
krogstad certainlyall the respect he deserves but since you have kept the matter so carefully to yourself i make bold to suppose that you have a little clearer idea than you had yesterday of what it actually is that you have done ,A Dolls House
krogstad only to see how you were mrs helmer i have been thinking about you all day long a mere cashier a quilldriver awell a man like meeven he has a little of what is called feeling you know ,A Dolls House
krogstad have you and your husband thought of mine but never mind about that i only wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter too seriously in the first place there will be no accusation made on my part ,A Dolls House
krogstad the whole thing can be arranged amicably there is no reason why anyone should know anything about it it will remain a secret between us three ,A Dolls House
krogstad well in any case it would have been of no use to you now if you stood there with ever so much money in your hand i would never part with your bond ,A Dolls House
krogstad i shall only preserve itkeep it in my possession no one who is not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it so that if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate resolution ,A Dolls House
krogstad i will tell you i want to rehabilitate myself mrs helmer i want to get on and in that your husband must help me for the last year and a half i have not had a hand in anything dishonourable amid all that time i have been struggling in most restricted circumstances i was content to work my way up step by step now i am turned out and i am not going to be satisfied with merely being taken into favour again i want to get on i tell you i want to get into the bank again in a higher position your husband must make a place for me ,A Dolls House
krogstad he will i know him he dare not protest and as soon as i am in there again with him then you will see within a year i shall be the managers right hand it will be nils krogstad and not torvald helmer who manages the bank ,A Dolls House
krogstad under the ice perhaps down into the cold coalblack water and then in the spring to float up to the surface all horrible and unrecognisable with your hair fallen out ,A Dolls House
krogstad have you forgotten that it is i who have the keeping of your reputation nora stands speechlessly looking at him well now i have warned you do not do anything foolish when helmer has had my letter i shall expect a message from him and be sure you remember that it is your husband himself who has forced me into such ways as this again i will never forgive him for that goodbye mrs helmer exit through the hall ,A Dolls House
nora goes to the hall door opens it slightly and listens he is going he is not putting the letter in the box oh no no thats impossible opens the door by degrees what is that he is standing outside he is not going downstairs is he hesitating can he a letter drops into the box then krogstads footsteps are heard until they die away as he goes downstairs nora utters a stifled cry and runs across the room to the table by the sofa a short pause ,A Dolls House
nora then you must be my witness that it is not true christine i am not out of my mind at all i am in my right senses now and i tell you no one else has known anything about it i and i alone did the whole thing remember that ,A Dolls House
helmer from the inner room well may i venture at last to come into my own room again come along rank now you will see halting in the doorway but what is this ,A Dolls House
nora yes help me torvald promise that you will i am so nervous about itall the people you must give yourself up to me entirely this evening not the tiniest bit of businessyou mustnt even take a pen in your hand will you promise torvald dear ,A Dolls House

nora yes so dreadfully afraid of it let me practise at once there is time now before we go to dinner sit down and play for me torvald dear criticise me and correct me as you play ,A Dolls House
nora takes out of the box a tambourine and a long variegated shawl she hastily drapes the shawl round her then she springs to the front of the stage and calls out now play for me i am going to dance ,A Dolls House
rank sits down at the piano and plays nora dances more and more wildly helmer has taken up a position beside the stove and during her dance gives her frequent instructions she does not seem to hear him her hair comes down and falls over her shoulders she pays no attention to it but goes on dancing enter mrs linde ,A Dolls House
helmer stop rank this is sheer madness stop i tell you rank stops playing and nora suddenly stands still helmer goes up to her i could never have believed it you have forgotten everything i taught you ,A Dolls House
helmer far from it my dear fellow it is simply nothing more than this childish nervousness i was telling you of they go into the righthand room ,A Dolls House
nora oh you wouldnt understand go in to them i will come in a moment mrs linde goes into the diningroom nora stands still for a little while as if to compose herself then she looks at her watch five oclock seven hours until midnight and then fourandtwenty hours until the next midnight then the tarantella will be over twentyfour and seven thirtyone hours to live ,A Dolls House
the same scenethe table has been placed in the middle of the stage with chairs around it a lamp is burning on the table the door into the hall stands open dance music is heard in the room above mrs linde is sitting at the table idly turning over the leaves of a book she tries to read but does not seem able to collect her thoughts every now and then she listens intently for a sound at the outer door ,A Dolls House
mrs linde looking at her watch not yetand the time is nearly up if only he does not listens again ah there he is goes into the hall and opens the outer door carefully light footsteps are heard on the stairs she whispers come in there is no one here ,A Dolls House
mrs linde it is impossible where i live there is no private entrance to my rooms come in we are quite alone the maid is asleep and the helmers are at the dance upstairs ,A Dolls House
krogstad was there anything else to understand except what was obvious to all the worlda heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrative chance turns up ,A Dolls House
mrs linde you must not forget that i had a helpless mother and two little brothers we couldnt wait for you nils your prospects seemed hopeless then ,A Dolls House
krogstad more gently when i lost you it was as if all the solid ground went from under my feet look at me nowi am a shipwrecked man clinging to a bit of wreckage ,A Dolls House
mrs linde i could not endure life without work all my life as long as i can remember i have worked and it has been my greatest and only pleasure but now i am quite alone in the worldmy life is so dreadfully empty and i feel so forsaken there is not the least pleasure in working for ones self nils give me someone and something to work for ,A Dolls House
mrs linde i want to be a mother to someone and your children need a mother we two need each other nils i have faith in your real characteri can dare anything together with you ,A Dolls House
krogstad yes of course i will i will wait here until helmer comes i will tell him he must give me my letter backthat it only concerns my dismissalthat he is not to read it ,A Dolls House
mrs linde in my first moment of fright it was but twentyfour hours have elapsed since then and in that time i have witnessed incredible things in this house helmer must know all about it this unhappy secret must be disclosed they must have a complete understanding between them which is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on ,A Dolls House
krogstad i have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my life goes out through the outer door the door between the room and the hall remains open ,A Dolls House
mrs linde tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready what a difference what a difference someone to work for and live fora home to bring comfort into that i will do indeed i wish they would be quick and comelistens ah there they are now i must put on my things takes up her hat and cloak helmers and noras voices are heard outside a key is turned and helmer brings nora almost by force into the hall she is in an italian costume with a large black shawl around her he is in evening dress and a black domino which is flying open ,A Dolls House
nora hanging back in the doorway and struggling with him no no nodont take me in i want to go upstairs again i dont want to leave so early ,A Dolls House
helmer not a single minute my sweet nora you know that was our agreement come along into the room you are catching cold standing there he brings her gently into the room in spite of her resistance ,A Dolls House

circumambulate the city of a dreamy sabbath afternoon go from corlears hook to coenties slip and from thence by whitehall northward what do you seeposted like silent sentinels all around the town stand thousands upon thousands of mortal men fixed in ocean reveries some leaning against the spiles some seated upon the pierheads some looking over the bulwarks of ships from china some high aloft in the rigging as if striving to get a still better seaward peep but these are all landsmen of week days pent up in lath and plastertied to counters nailed to benches clinched to desks how then is this are the green fields gone what do they here ,MobyDick or The Whale
but look here come more crowds pacing straight for the water and seemingly bound for a dive strange nothing will content them but the extremest limit of the land loitering under the shady lee of yonder warehouses will not suffice no they must get just as nigh the water as they possibly can without falling in and there they standmiles of themleagues inlanders all they come from lanes and alleys streets and avenuesnorth east south and west yet here they all unite tell me does the magnetic virtue of the needles of the compasses of all those ships attract them thither ,MobyDick or The Whale
once more say you are in the country in some high land of lakes take almost any path you please and ten to one it carries you down in a dale and leaves you there by a pool in the stream there is magic in it let the most absentminded of men be plunged in his deepest reveriesstand that man on his legs set his feet agoing and he will infallibly lead you to water if water there be in all that region should you ever be athirst in the great american desert try this experiment if your caravan happen to be supplied with a metaphysical professor yes as every one knows meditation and water are wedded for ever ,MobyDick or The Whale
but here is an artist he desires to paint you the dreamiest shadiest quietest most enchanting bit of romantic landscape in all the valley of the saco what is the chief element he employs there stand his trees each with a hollow trunk as if a hermit and a crucifix were within and here sleeps his meadow and there sleep his cattle and up from yonder cottage goes a sleepy smoke deep into distant woodlands winds a mazy way reaching to overlapping spurs of mountains bathed in their hillside blue but though the picture lies thus tranced and though this pinetree shakes down its sighs like leaves upon this shepherds head yet all were vain unless the shepherds eye were fixed upon the magic stream before him go visit the prairies in june when for scores on scores of miles you wade kneedeep among tigerlilieswhat is the one charm wantingwaterthere is not a drop of water there were niagara but a cataract of sand would you travel your thousand miles to see it why did the poor poet of tennessee upon suddenly receiving two handfuls of silver deliberate whether to buy him a coat which he sadly needed or invest his money in a pedestrian trip to rockaway beach why is almost every robust healthy boy with a robust healthy soul in him at some time or other crazy to go to sea why upon your first voyage as a passenger did you yourself feel such a mystical vibration when first told that you and your ship were now out of sight of land why did the old persians hold the sea holy why did the greeks give it a separate deity and own brother of jove surely all this is not without meaning and still deeper the meaning of that story of narcissus who because he could not grasp the tormenting mild image he saw in the fountain plunged into it and was drowned but that same image we ourselves see in all rivers and oceans it is the image of the ungraspable phantom of life and this is the key to it all ,MobyDick or The Whale
now when i say that i am in the habit of going to sea whenever i begin to grow hazy about the eyes and begin to be over conscious of my lungs i do not mean to have it inferred that i ever go to sea as a passenger for to go as a passenger you must needs have a purse and a purse is but a rag unless you have something in it besides passengers get seasickgrow quarrelsomedont sleep of nightsdo not enjoy themselves much as a general thingno i never go as a passenger nor though i am something of a salt do i ever go to sea as a commodore or a captain or a cook i abandon the glory and distinction of such offices to those who like them for my part i abominate all honorable respectable toils trials and tribulations of every kind whatsoever it is quite as much as i can do to take care of myself without taking care of ships barques brigs schooners and what not and as for going as cookthough i confess there is considerable glory in that a cook being a sort of officer on shipboardyet somehow i never fancied broiling fowlsthough once broiled judiciously buttered and judgmatically salted and peppered there is no one who will speak more respectfully not to say reverentially of a broiled fowl than i will it is out of the idolatrous dotings of the old egyptians upon broiled ibis and roasted river horse that you see the mummies of those creatures in their huge bakehouses the pyramids ,MobyDick or The Whale
no when i go to sea i go as a simple sailor right before the mast plumb down into the forecastle aloft there to the royal masthead true they rather order me about some and make me jump from spar to spar like a grasshopper in a may meadow and at first this sort of thing is unpleasant enough it touches ones sense of honor particularly if you come of an old established family in the land the van rensselaers or randolphs or hardicanutes and more than all if just previous to putting your hand into the tarpot you have been lording it as a country schoolmaster making the tallest boys stand in awe of you the transition is a keen one i assure you from a schoolmaster to a sailor and requires a strong decoction of seneca and the stoics to enable you to grin and bear it but even this wears off in time ,MobyDick or The Whale
what of it if some old hunks of a seacaptain orders me to get a broom and sweep down the decks what does that indignity amount to weighed i mean in the scales of the new testament do you think the archangel gabriel thinks anything the less of me because i promptly and respectfully obey that old hunks in that particular instance who aint a slave tell me that well then however the old seacaptains may order me abouthowever they may thump and punch me about i have the satisfaction of knowing that it is all right that everybody else is one way or other served in much the same wayeither in a physical or metaphysical point of view that is and so the universal thump is passed round and all hands should rub each others shoulderblades and be content ,MobyDick or The Whale
again i always go to sea as a sailor because they make a point of paying me for my trouble whereas they never pay passengers a single penny that i ever heard of on the contrary passengers themselves must pay and there is all the difference in the world between paying and being paid the act of paying is perhaps the most uncomfortable infliction that the two orchard thieves entailed upon us but being paidwhat will compare with it the urbane activity with which a man receives money is really marvellous considering that we so earnestly believe money to be the root of all earthly ills and that on no account can a monied man enter heaven ah how cheerfully we consign ourselves to perdition ,MobyDick or The Whale
finally i always go to sea as a sailor because of the wholesome exercise and pure air of the forecastle deck for as in this world head winds are far more prevalent than winds from astern that is if you never violate the pythagorean maxim so for the most part the commodore on the quarterdeck gets his atmosphere at second hand from the sailors on the forecastle he thinks he breathes it first but not so in much the same way do the commonalty lead their leaders in many other things at the same time that the leaders little suspect it but wherefore it was that after having repeatedly smelt the sea as a merchant sailor i should now take it into my head to go on a whaling voyage this the invisible police officer of the fates who has the constant surveillance of me and secretly dogs me and influences me in some unaccountable wayhe can better answer than any one else and doubtless my going on this whaling voyage formed part of the grand programme of providence that was drawn up a long time ago it came in as a sort of brief interlude and solo between more extensive performances i take it that this part of the bill must have run something like this ,MobyDick or The Whale
though i cannot tell why it was exactly that those stage managers the fates put me down for this shabby part of a whaling voyage when others were set down for magnificent parts in high tragedies and short and easy parts in genteel comedies and jolly parts in farcesthough i cannot tell why this was exactly yet now that i recall all the circumstances i think i can see a little into the springs and motives which being cunningly presented to me under various disguises induced me to set about performing the part i did besides cajoling me into the delusion that it was a choice resulting from my own unbiased freewill and discriminating judgment ,MobyDick or The Whale
chief among these motives was the overwhelming idea of the great whale himself such a portentous and mysterious monster roused all my curiosity then the wild and distant seas where he rolled his island bulk the undeliverable nameless perils of the whale these with all the attending marvels of a thousand patagonian sights and sounds helped to sway me to my wish with other men perhaps such things would not have been inducements but as for me i am tormented with an everlasting itch for things remote i love to sail forbidden seas and land on barbarous coasts not ignoring what is good i am quick to perceive a horror and could still be social with itwould they let mesince it is but well to be on friendly terms with all the inmates of the place one lodges in ,MobyDick or The Whale
by reason of these things then the whaling voyage was welcome the great floodgates of the wonderworld swung open and in the wild conceits that swayed me to my purpose two and two there floated into my inmost soul endless processions of the whale and mid most of them all one grand hooded phantom like a snow hill in the air ,MobyDick or The Whale
i stuffed a shirt or two into my old carpetbag tucked it under my arm and started for cape horn and the pacific quitting the good city of old manhatto i duly arrived in new bedford it was a saturday night in december much was i disappointed upon learning that the little packet for nantucket had already sailed and that no way of reaching that place would offer till the following monday ,MobyDick or The Whale
as most young candidates for the pains and penalties of whaling stop at this same new bedford thence to embark on their voyage it may as well be related that i for one had no idea of so doing for my mind was made up to sail in no other than a nantucket craft because there was a fine boisterous something about everything connected with that famous old island which amazingly pleased me besides though new bedford has of late been gradually monopolising the business of whaling and though in this matter poor old nantucket is now much behind her yet nantucket was her great originalthe tyre of this carthagethe place where the first dead american whale was stranded where else but from nantucket did those aboriginal whalemen the redmen first sally out in canoes to give chase to the leviathan and where but from nantucket too did that first adventurous little sloop put forth partly laden with imported cobblestonesso goes the storyto throw at the whales in order to discover when they were nigh enough to risk a harpoon from the bowsprit ,MobyDick or The Whale
now having a night a day and still another night following before me in new bedford ere i could embark for my destined port it became a matter of concernment where i was to eat and sleep meanwhile it was a very dubiouslooking nay a very dark and dismal night bitingly cold and cheerless i knew no one in the place with anxious grapnels i had sounded my pocket and only brought up a few pieces of silverso wherever you go ishmael said i to myself as i stood in the middle of a dreary street shouldering my bag and comparing the gloom towards the north with the darkness towards the southwherever in your wisdom you may conclude to lodge for the night my dear ishmael be sure to inquire the price and dont be too particular ,MobyDick or The Whale
with halting steps i paced the streets and passed the sign of the crossed harpoonsbut it looked too expensive and jolly there further on from the bright red windows of the swordfish inn there came such fervent rays that it seemed to have melted the packed snow and ice from before the house for everywhere else the congealed frost lay ten inches thick in a hard asphaltic pavementrather weary for me when i struck my foot against the flinty projections because from hard remorseless service the soles of my boots were in a most miserable plight too expensive and jolly again thought i pausing one moment to watch the broad glare in the street and hear the sounds of the tinkling glasses within but go on ishmael said i at last dont you hear get away from before the door your patched boots are stopping the way so on i went i now by instinct followed the streets that took me waterward for there doubtless were the cheapest if not the cheeriest inns ,MobyDick or The Whale
such dreary streets blocks of blackness not houses on either hand and here and there a candle like a candle moving about in a tomb at this hour of the night of the last day of the week that quarter of the town proved all but deserted but presently i came to a smoky light proceeding from a low wide building the door of which stood invitingly open it had a careless look as if it were meant for the uses of the public so entering the first thing i did was to stumble over an ashbox in the porch ha thought i ha as the flying particles almost choked me are these ashes from that destroyed city gomorrah but the crossed harpoons and the swordfishthis then must needs be the sign of the trap however i picked myself up and hearing a loud voice within pushed on and opened a second interior door ,MobyDick or The Whale
it seemed the great black parliament sitting in tophet a hundred black faces turned round in their rows to peer and beyond a black angel of doom was beating a book in a pulpit it was a negro church and the preachers text was about the blackness of darkness and the weeping and wailing and teethgnashing there ha ishmael muttered i backing out wretched entertainment at the sign of the trap ,MobyDick or The Whale
moving on i at last came to a dim sort of light not far from the docks and heard a forlorn creaking in the air and looking up saw a swinging sign over the door with a white painting upon it faintly representing a tall straight jet of misty spray and these words underneaththe spouter innpeter coffin ,MobyDick or The Whale
coffinspouterrather ominous in that particular connexion thought i but it is a common name in nantucket they say and i suppose this peter here is an emigrant from there as the light looked so dim and the place for the time looked quiet enough and the dilapidated little wooden house itself looked as if it might have been carted here from the ruins of some burnt district and as the swinging sign had a povertystricken sort of creak to it i thought that here was the very spot for cheap lodgings and the best of pea coffee ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a queer sort of placea gableended old house one side palsied as it were and leaning over sadly it stood on a sharp bleak corner where that tempestuous wind euroclydon kept up a worse howling than ever it did about poor pauls tossed craft euroclydon nevertheless is a mighty pleasant zephyr to any one indoors with his feet on the hob quietly toasting for bed in judging of that tempestuous wind called euroclydon says an old writerof whose works i possess the only copy extantit maketh a marvellous difference whether thou lookest out at it from a glass window where the frost is all on the outside or whether thou observest it from that sashless window where the frost is on both sides and of which the wight death is the only glazier true enough thought i as this passage occurred to my mindold blackletter thou reasonest well yes these eyes are windows and this body of mine is the house what a pity they didnt stop up the chinks and the crannies though and thrust in a little lint here and there but its too late to make any improvements now the universe is finished the copestone is on and the chips were carted off a million years ago poor lazarus there chattering his teeth against the curbstone for his pillow and shaking off his tatters with his shiverings he might plug up both ears with rags and put a corncob into his mouth and yet that would not keep out the tempestuous euroclydon euroclydon says old dives in his red silken wrapperhe had a redder one afterwards pooh pooh what a fine frosty night how orion glitters what northern lights let them talk of their oriental summer climes of everlasting conservatories give me the privilege of making my own summer with my own coals ,MobyDick or The Whale
but what thinks lazarus can he warm his blue hands by holding them up to the grand northern lights would not lazarus rather be in sumatra than here would he not far rather lay him down lengthwise along the line of the equator yea ye gods go down to the fiery pit itself in order to keep out this frost ,MobyDick or The Whale
now that lazarus should lie stranded there on the curbstone before the door of dives this is more wonderful than that an iceberg should be moored to one of the moluccas yet dives himself he too lives like a czar in an ice palace made of frozen sighs and being a president of a temperance society he only drinks the tepid tears of orphans ,MobyDick or The Whale
entering that gableended spouterinn you found yourself in a wide low straggling entry with oldfashioned wainscots reminding one of the bulwarks of some condemned old craft on one side hung a very large oilpainting so thoroughly besmoked and every way defaced that in the unequal crosslights by which you viewed it it was only by diligent study and a series of systematic visits to it and careful inquiry of the neighbors that you could any way arrive at an understanding of its purpose such unaccountable masses of shades and shadows that at first you almost thought some ambitious young artist in the time of the new england hags had endeavored to delineate chaos bewitched but by dint of much and earnest contemplation and oft repeated ponderings and especially by throwing open the little window towards the back of the entry you at last come to the conclusion that such an idea however wild might not be altogether unwarranted ,MobyDick or The Whale
but what most puzzled and confounded you was a long limber portentous black mass of something hovering in the centre of the picture over three blue dim perpendicular lines floating in a nameless yeast a boggy soggy squitchy picture truly enough to drive a nervous man distracted yet was there a sort of indefinite halfattained unimaginable sublimity about it that fairly froze you to it till you involuntarily took an oath with yourself to find out what that marvellous painting meant ever and anon a bright but alas deceptive idea would dart you throughits the black sea in a midnight galeits the unnatural combat of the four primal elementsits a blasted heathits a hyperborean winter sceneits the breakingup of the icebound stream of time but at last all these fancies yielded to that one portentous something in the pictures midst that once found out and all the rest were plain but stop does it not bear a faint resemblance to a gigantic fish even the great leviathan himself ,MobyDick or The Whale
in fact the artists design seemed this a final theory of my own partly based upon the aggregated opinions of many aged persons with whom i conversed upon the subject the picture represents a capehorner in a great hurricane the halffoundered ship weltering there with its three dismantled masts alone visible and an exasperated whale purposing to spring clean over the craft is in the enormous act of impaling himself upon the three mastheads ,MobyDick or The Whale
the opposite wall of this entry was hung all over with a heathenish array of monstrous clubs and spears some were thickly set with glittering teeth resembling ivory saws others were tufted with knots of human hair and one was sickleshaped with a vast handle sweeping round like the segment made in the newmown grass by a longarmed mower you shuddered as you gazed and wondered what monstrous cannibal and savage could ever have gone a deathharvesting with such a hacking horrifying implement mixed with these were rusty old whaling lances and harpoons all broken and deformed some were storied weapons with this once long lance now wildly elbowed fifty years ago did nathan swain kill fifteen whales between a sunrise and a sunset and that harpoonso like a corkscrew nowwas flung in javan seas and run away with by a whale years afterwards slain off the cape of blanco the original iron entered nigh the tail and like a restless needle sojourning in the body of a man travelled full forty feet and at last was found imbedded in the hump ,MobyDick or The Whale
crossing this dusky entry and on through yon lowarched waycut through what in old times must have been a great central chimney with fireplaces all roundyou enter the public room a still duskier place is this with such low ponderous beams above and such old wrinkled planks beneath that you would almost fancy you trod some old crafts cockpits especially of such a howling night when this corneranchored old ark rocked so furiously on one side stood a long low shelflike table covered with cracked glass cases filled with dusty rarities gathered from this wide worlds remotest nooks projecting from the further angle of the room stands a darklooking denthe bara rude attempt at a right whales head be that how it may there stands the vast arched bone of the whales jaw so wide a coach might almost drive beneath it within are shabby shelves ranged round with old decanters bottles flasks and in those jaws of swift destruction like another cursed jonah by which name indeed they called him bustles a little withered old man who for their money dearly sells the sailors deliriums and death ,MobyDick or The Whale
abominable are the tumblers into which he pours his poison though true cylinders withoutwithin the villanous green goggling glasses deceitfully tapered downwards to a cheating bottom parallel meridians rudely pecked into the glass surround these footpads goblets fill to this mark and your charge is but a penny to this a penny more and so on to the full glassthe cape horn measure which you may gulp down for a shilling ,MobyDick or The Whale
upon entering the place i found a number of young seamen gathered about a table examining by a dim light divers specimens of skrimshander i sought the landlord and telling him i desired to be accommodated with a room received for answer that his house was fullnot a bed unoccupied but avast he added tapping his forehead you haint no objections to sharing a harpooneers blanket have ye i spose you are goin awhalin so youd better get used to that sort of thing ,MobyDick or The Whale
i told him that i never liked to sleep two in a bed that if i should ever do so it would depend upon who the harpooneer might be and that if he the landlord really had no other place for me and the harpooneer was not decidedly objectionable why rather than wander further about a strange town on so bitter a night i would put up with the half of any decent mans blanket ,MobyDick or The Whale
i sat down on an old wooden settle carved all over like a bench on the battery at one end a ruminating tar was still further adorning it with his jackknife stooping over and diligently working away at the space between his legs he was trying his hand at a ship under full sail but he didnt make much headway i thought ,MobyDick or The Whale
at last some four or five of us were summoned to our meal in an adjoining room it was cold as icelandno fire at allthe landlord said he couldnt afford it nothing but two dismal tallow candles each in a winding sheet we were fain to button up our monkey jackets and hold to our lips cups of scalding tea with our half frozen fingers but the fare was of the most substantial kindnot only meat and potatoes but dumplings good heavens dumplings for supper one young fellow in a green box coat addressed himself to these dumplings in a most direful manner ,MobyDick or The Whale
i could not help it but i began to feel suspicious of this dark complexioned harpooneer at any rate i made up my mind that if it so turned out that we should sleep together he must undress and get into bed before i did ,MobyDick or The Whale
presently a rioting noise was heard without starting up the landlord cried thats the grampuss crew i seed her reported in the offing this morning a three years voyage and a full ship hurrah boys now well have the latest news from the feegees ,MobyDick or The Whale
a tramping of sea boots was heard in the entry the door was flung open and in rolled a wild set of mariners enough enveloped in their shaggy watch coats and with their heads muffled in woollen comforters all bedarned and ragged and their beards stiff with icicles they seemed an eruption of bears from labrador they had just landed from their boat and this was the first house they entered no wonder then that they made a straight wake for the whales mouththe barwhen the wrinkled little old jonah there officiating soon poured them out brimmers all round one complained of a bad cold in his head upon which jonah mixed him a pitchlike potion of gin and molasses which he swore was a sovereign cure for all colds and catarrhs whatsoever never mind of how long standing or whether caught off the coast of labrador or on the weather side of an iceisland ,MobyDick or The Whale
i observed however that one of them held somewhat aloof and though he seemed desirous not to spoil the hilarity of his shipmates by his own sober face yet upon the whole he refrained from making as much noise as the rest this man interested me at once and since the seagods had ordained that he should soon become my shipmate though but a sleepingpartner one so far as this narrative is concerned i will here venture upon a little description of him he stood full six feet in height with noble shoulders and a chest like a cofferdam i have seldom seen such brawn in a man his face was deeply brown and burnt making his white teeth dazzling by the contrast while in the deep shadows of his eyes floated some reminiscences that did not seem to give him much joy his voice at once announced that he was a southerner and from his fine stature i thought he must be one of those tall mountaineers from the alleghanian ridge in virginia when the revelry of his companions had mounted to its height this man slipped away unobserved and i saw no more of him till he became my comrade on the sea in a few minutes however he was missed by his shipmates and being it seems for some reason a huge favourite with them they raised a cry of bulkington bulkington wheres bulkington and darted out of the house in pursuit of him ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was now about nine oclock and the room seeming almost supernaturally quiet after these orgies i began to congratulate myself upon a little plan that had occurred to me just previous to the entrance of the seamen ,MobyDick or The Whale
no man prefers to sleep two in a bed in fact you would a good deal rather not sleep with your own brother i dont know how it is but people like to be private when they are sleeping and when it comes to sleeping with an unknown stranger in a strange inn in a strange town and that stranger a harpooneer then your objections indefinitely multiply nor was there any earthly reason why i as a sailor should sleep two in a bed more than anybody else for sailors no more sleep two in a bed at sea than bachelor kings do ashore to be sure they all sleep together in one apartment but you have your own hammock and cover yourself with your own blanket and sleep in your own skin ,MobyDick or The Whale
the more i pondered over this harpooneer the more i abominated the thought of sleeping with him it was fair to presume that being a harpooneer his linen or woollen as the case might be would not be of the tidiest certainly none of the finest i began to twitch all over besides it was getting late and my decent harpooneer ought to be home and going bedwards suppose now he should tumble in upon me at midnighthow could i tell from what vile hole he had been coming ,MobyDick or The Whale
just as you please im sorry i cant spare ye a tablecloth for a mattress and its a plaguy rough board herefeeling of the knots and notches but wait a bit skrimshander ive got a carpenters plane there in the barwait i say and ill make ye snug enough so saying he procured the plane and with his old silk handkerchief first dusting the bench vigorously set to planing away at my bed the while grinning like an ape the shavings flew right and left till at last the planeiron came bump against an indestructible knot the landlord was near spraining his wrist and i told him for heavens sake to quitthe bed was soft enough to suit me and i did not know how all the planing in the world could make eider down of a pine plank so gathering up the shavings with another grin and throwing them into the great stove in the middle of the room he went about his business and left me in a brown study ,MobyDick or The Whale
i now took the measure of the bench and found that it was a foot too short but that could be mended with a chair but it was a foot too narrow and the other bench in the room was about four inches higher than the planed oneso there was no yoking them i then placed the first bench lengthwise along the only clear space against the wall leaving a little interval between for my back to settle down in but i soon found that there came such a draught of cold air over me from under the sill of the window that this plan would never do at all especially as another current from the rickety door met the one from the window and both together formed a series of small whirlwinds in the immediate vicinity of the spot where i had thought to spend the night ,MobyDick or The Whale
the devil fetch that harpooneer thought i but stop couldnt i steal a march on himbolt his door inside and jump into his bed not to be wakened by the most violent knockings it seemed no bad idea but upon second thoughts i dismissed it for who could tell but what the next morning so soon as i popped out of the room the harpooneer might be standing in the entry all ready to knock me down ,MobyDick or The Whale
still looking round me again and seeing no possible chance of spending a sufferable night unless in some other persons bed i began to think that after all i might be cherishing unwarrantable prejudices against this unknown harpooneer thinks i ill wait awhile he must be dropping in before long ill have a good look at him then and perhaps we may become jolly good bedfellows after alltheres no telling ,MobyDick or The Whale
the landlord chuckled again with his lean chuckle and seemed to be mightily tickled at something beyond my comprehension no he answered generally hes an early birdairley to bed and airley to riseyes hes the bird what catches the worm but tonight he went out a peddling you see and i dont see what on airth keeps him so late unless may be he cant sell his head ,MobyDick or The Whale
cant sell his headwhat sort of a bamboozingly story is this you are telling me getting into a towering rage do you pretend to say landlord that this harpooneer is actually engaged this blessed saturday night or rather sunday morning in peddling his head around this town ,MobyDick or The Whale
landlord said i going up to him as cool as mt hecla in a snowstormlandlord stop whittling you and i must understand one another and that too without delay i come to your house and want a bed you tell me you can only give me half a one that the other half belongs to a certain harpooneer and about this harpooneer whom i have not yet seen you persist in telling me the most mystifying and exasperating stories tending to beget in me an uncomfortable feeling towards the man whom you design for my bedfellowa sort of connexion landlord which is an intimate and confidential one in the highest degree i now demand of you to speak out and tell me who and what this harpooneer is and whether i shall be in all respects safe to spend the night with him and in the first place you will be so good as to unsay that story about selling his head which if true i take to be good evidence that this harpooneer is stark mad and ive no idea of sleeping with a madman and you sir you i mean landlord you sir by trying to induce me to do so knowingly would thereby render yourself liable to a criminal prosecution ,MobyDick or The Whale
wall said the landlord fetching a long breath thats a purty long sarmon for a chap that rips a little now and then but be easy be easy this here harpooneer i have been tellin you of has just arrived from the south seas where he bought up a lot of balmed new zealand heads great curios you know and hes sold all on em but one and that one hes trying to sell tonight cause tomorrows sunday and it would not do to be sellin human heads about the streets when folks is goin to churches he wanted to last sunday but i stopped him just as he was goin out of the door with four heads strung on a string for all the airth like a string of inions ,MobyDick or The Whale
this account cleared up the otherwise unaccountable mystery and showed that the landlord after all had had no idea of fooling mebut at the same time what could i think of a harpooneer who stayed out of a saturday night clean into the holy sabbath engaged in such a cannibal business as selling the heads of dead idolators ,MobyDick or The Whale
he pays reglar was the rejoinder but come its getting dreadful late you had better be turning flukesits a nice bed sal and me slept in that ere bed the night we were spliced theres plenty of room for two to kick about in that bed its an almighty big bed that why afore we give it up sal used to put our sam and little johnny in the foot of it but i got a dreaming and sprawling about one night and somehow sam got pitched on the floor and came near breaking his arm arter that sal said it wouldnt do come along here ill give ye a glim in a jiffy and so saying he lighted a candle and held it towards me offering to lead the way but i stood irresolute when looking at a clock in the corner he exclaimed i vum its sundayyou wont see that harpooneer tonight hes come to anchor somewherecome along then do come wont ye come ,MobyDick or The Whale
i considered the matter a moment and then up stairs we went and i was ushered into a small room cold as a clam and furnished sure enough with a prodigious bed almost big enough indeed for any four harpooneers to sleep abreast ,MobyDick or The Whale
there said the landlord placing the candle on a crazy old sea chest that did double duty as a washstand and centre table there make yourself comfortable now and good night to ye i turned round from eyeing the bed but he had disappeared ,MobyDick or The Whale
folding back the counterpane i stooped over the bed though none of the most elegant it yet stood the scrutiny tolerably well i then glanced round the room and besides the bedstead and centre table could see no other furniture belonging to the place but a rude shelf the four walls and a papered fireboard representing a man striking a whale of things not properly belonging to the room there was a hammock lashed up and thrown upon the floor in one corner also a large seamans bag containing the harpooneers wardrobe no doubt in lieu of a land trunk likewise there was a parcel of outlandish bone fish hooks on the shelf over the fireplace and a tall harpoon standing at the head of the bed ,MobyDick or The Whale
but what is this on the chest i took it up and held it close to the light and felt it and smelt it and tried every way possible to arrive at some satisfactory conclusion concerning it i can compare it to nothing but a large door mat ornamented at the edges with little tinkling tags something like the stained porcupine quills round an indian moccasin there was a hole or slit in the middle of this mat as you see the same in south american ponchos but could it be possible that any sober harpooneer would get into a door mat and parade the streets of any christian town in that sort of guise i put it on to try it and it weighed me down like a hamper being uncommonly shaggy and thick and i thought a little damp as though this mysterious harpooneer had been wearing it of a rainy day i went up in it to a bit of glass stuck against the wall and i never saw such a sight in my life i tore myself out of it in such a hurry that i gave myself a kink in the neck ,MobyDick or The Whale
i sat down on the side of the bed and commenced thinking about this headpeddling harpooneer and his door mat after thinking some time on the bedside i got up and took off my monkey jacket and then stood in the middle of the room thinking i then took off my coat and thought a little more in my shirt sleeves but beginning to feel very cold now half undressed as i was and remembering what the landlord said about the harpooneers not coming home at all that night it being so very late i made no more ado but jumped out of my pantaloons and boots and then blowing out the light tumbled into bed and commended myself to the care of heaven ,MobyDick or The Whale
whether that mattress was stuffed with corncobs or broken crockery there is no telling but i rolled about a good deal and could not sleep for a long time at last i slid off into a light doze and had pretty nearly made a good offing towards the land of nod when i heard a heavy footfall in the passage and saw a glimmer of light come into the room from under the door ,MobyDick or The Whale
lord save me thinks i that must be the harpooneer the infernal headpeddler but i lay perfectly still and resolved not to say a word till spoken to holding a light in one hand and that identical new zealand head in the other the stranger entered the room and without looking towards the bed placed his candle a good way off from me on the floor in one corner and then began working away at the knotted cords of the large bag i before spoke of as being in the room i was all eagerness to see his face but he kept it averted for some time while employed in unlacing the bags mouth this accomplished however he turned roundwhen good heavens what a sight such a face it was of a dark purplish yellow colour here and there stuck over with large blackish looking squares yes its just as i thought hes a terrible bedfellow hes been in a fight got dreadfully cut and here he is just from the surgeon but at that moment he chanced to turn his face so towards the light that i plainly saw they could not be stickingplasters at all those black squares on his cheeks they were stains of some sort or other at first i knew not what to make of this but soon an inkling of the truth occurred to me i remembered a story of a white mana whaleman toowho falling among the cannibals had been tattooed by them i concluded that this harpooneer in the course of his distant voyages must have met with a similar adventure and what is it thought i after all its only his outside a man can be honest in any sort of skin but then what to make of his unearthly complexion that part of it i mean lying round about and completely independent of the squares of tattooing to be sure it might be nothing but a good coat of tropical tanning but i never heard of a hot suns tanning a white man into a purplish yellow one however i had never been in the south seas and perhaps the sun there produced these extraordinary effects upon the skin now while all these ideas were passing through me like lightning this harpooneer never noticed me at all but after some difficulty having opened his bag he commenced fumbling in it and presently pulled out a sort of tomahawk and a sealskin wallet with the hair on placing these on the old chest in the middle of the room he then took the new zealand heada ghastly thing enoughand crammed it down into the bag he now took off his hata new beaver hatwhen i came nigh singing out with fresh surprise there was no hair on his headnone to speak of at leastnothing but a small scalpknot twisted up on his forehead his bald purplish head now looked for all the world like a mildewed skull had not the stranger stood between me and the door i would have bolted out of it quicker than ever i bolted a dinner ,MobyDick or The Whale
even as it was i thought something of slipping out of the window but it was the second floor back i am no coward but what to make of this headpeddling purple rascal altogether passed my comprehension ignorance is the parent of fear and being completely nonplussed and confounded about the stranger i confess i was now as much afraid of him as if it was the devil himself who had thus broken into my room at the dead of night in fact i was so afraid of him that i was not game enough just then to address him and demand a satisfactory answer concerning what seemed inexplicable in him ,MobyDick or The Whale
meanwhile he continued the business of undressing and at last showed his chest and arms as i live these covered parts of him were checkered with the same squares as his face his back too was all over the same dark squares he seemed to have been in a thirty years war and just escaped from it with a stickingplaster shirt still more his very legs were marked as if a parcel of dark green frogs were running up the trunks of young palms it was now quite plain that he must be some abominable savage or other shipped aboard of a whaleman in the south seas and so landed in this christian country i quaked to think of it a peddler of heads tooperhaps the heads of his own brothers he might take a fancy to mineheavens look at that tomahawk ,MobyDick or The Whale
but there was no time for shuddering for now the savage went about something that completely fascinated my attention and convinced me that he must indeed be a heathen going to his heavy grego or wrapall or dreadnaught which he had previously hung on a chair he fumbled in the pockets and produced at length a curious little deformed image with a hunch on its back and exactly the colour of a three days old congo baby remembering the embalmed head at first i almost thought that this black manikin was a real baby preserved in some similar manner but seeing that it was not at all limber and that it glistened a good deal like polished ebony i concluded that it must be nothing but a wooden idol which indeed it proved to be for now the savage goes up to the empty fireplace and removing the papered fireboard sets up this little hunchbacked image like a tenpin between the andirons the chimney jambs and all the bricks inside were very sooty so that i thought this fireplace made a very appropriate little shrine or chapel for his congo idol ,MobyDick or The Whale
i now screwed my eyes hard towards the half hidden image feeling but ill at ease meantimeto see what was next to follow first he takes about a double handful of shavings out of his grego pocket and places them carefully before the idol then laying a bit of ship biscuit on top and applying the flame from the lamp he kindled the shavings into a sacrificial blaze presently after many hasty snatches into the fire and still hastier withdrawals of his fingers whereby he seemed to be scorching them badly he at last succeeded in drawing out the biscuit then blowing off the heat and ashes a little he made a polite offer of it to the little negro but the little devil did not seem to fancy such dry sort of fare at all he never moved his lips all these strange antics were accompanied by still stranger guttural noises from the devotee who seemed to be praying in a singsong or else singing some pagan psalmody or other during which his face twitched about in the most unnatural manner at last extinguishing the fire he took the idol up very unceremoniously and bagged it again in his grego pocket as carelessly as if he were a sportsman bagging a dead woodcock ,MobyDick or The Whale
all these queer proceedings increased my uncomfortableness and seeing him now exhibiting strong symptoms of concluding his business operations and jumping into bed with me i thought it was high time now or never before the light was put out to break the spell in which i had so long been bound ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the interval i spent in deliberating what to say was a fatal one taking up his tomahawk from the table he examined the head of it for an instant and then holding it to the light with his mouth at the handle he puffed out great clouds of tobacco smoke the next moment the light was extinguished and this wild cannibal tomahawk between his teeth sprang into bed with me i sang out i could not help it now and giving a sudden grunt of astonishment he began feeling me ,MobyDick or The Whale
stammering out something i knew not what i rolled away from him against the wall and then conjured him whoever or whatever he might be to keep quiet and let me get up and light the lamp again but his guttural responses satisfied me at once that he but ill comprehended my meaning ,MobyDick or The Whale
speake tellee me whoee be or damme i kille again growled the cannibal while his horrid flourishings of the tomahawk scattered the hot tobacco ashes about me till i thought my linen would get on fire but thank heaven at that moment the landlord came into the room light in hand and leaping from the bed i ran up to him ,MobyDick or The Whale
you gettee in he added motioning to me with his tomahawk and throwing the clothes to one side he really did this in not only a civil but a really kind and charitable way i stood looking at him a moment for all his tattooings he was on the whole a clean comely looking cannibal whats all this fuss i have been making about thought i to myselfthe mans a human being just as i am he has just as much reason to fear me as i have to be afraid of him better sleep with a sober cannibal than a drunken christian ,MobyDick or The Whale
landlord said i tell him to stash his tomahawk there or pipe or whatever you call it tell him to stop smoking in short and i will turn in with him but i dont fancy having a man smoking in bed with me its dangerous besides i aint insured ,MobyDick or The Whale
upon waking next morning about daylight i found queequegs arm thrown over me in the most loving and affectionate manner you had almost thought i had been his wife the counterpane was of patchwork full of odd little particoloured squares and triangles and this arm of his tattooed all over with an interminable cretan labyrinth of a figure no two parts of which were of one precise shadeowing i suppose to his keeping his arm at sea unmethodically in sun and shade his shirt sleeves irregularly rolled up at various timesthis same arm of his i say looked for all the world like a strip of that same patchwork quilt indeed partly lying on it as the arm did when i first awoke i could hardly tell it from the quilt they so blended their hues together and it was only by the sense of weight and pressure that i could tell that queequeg was hugging me ,MobyDick or The Whale
my sensations were strange let me try to explain them when i was a child i well remember a somewhat similar circumstance that befell me whether it was a reality or a dream i never could entirely settle the circumstance was this i had been cutting up some caper or otheri think it was trying to crawl up the chimney as i had seen a little sweep do a few days previous and my stepmother who somehow or other was all the time whipping me or sending me to bed supperlessmy mother dragged me by the legs out of the chimney and packed me off to bed though it was only two oclock in the afternoon of the st june the longest day in the year in our hemisphere i felt dreadfully but there was no help for it so up stairs i went to my little room in the third floor undressed myself as slowly as possible so as to kill time and with a bitter sigh got between the sheets ,MobyDick or The Whale
i lay there dismally calculating that sixteen entire hours must elapse before i could hope for a resurrection sixteen hours in bed the small of my back ached to think of it and it was so light too the sun shining in at the window and a great rattling of coaches in the streets and the sound of gay voices all over the house i felt worse and worseat last i got up dressed and softly going down in my stockinged feet sought out my stepmother and suddenly threw myself at her feet beseeching her as a particular favour to give me a good slippering for my misbehaviour anything indeed but condemning me to lie abed such an unendurable length of time but she was the best and most conscientious of stepmothers and back i had to go to my room for several hours i lay there broad awake feeling a great deal worse than i have ever done since even from the greatest subsequent misfortunes at last i must have fallen into a troubled nightmare of a doze and slowly waking from ithalf steeped in dreamsi opened my eyes and the before sunlit room was now wrapped in outer darkness instantly i felt a shock running through all my frame nothing was to be seen and nothing was to be heard but a supernatural hand seemed placed in mine my arm hung over the counterpane and the nameless unimaginable silent form or phantom to which the hand belonged seemed closely seated by my bedside for what seemed ages piled on ages i lay there frozen with the most awful fears not daring to drag away my hand yet ever thinking that if i could but stir it one single inch the horrid spell would be broken i knew not how this consciousness at last glided away from me but waking in the morning i shudderingly remembered it all and for days and weeks and months afterwards i lost myself in confounding attempts to explain the mystery nay to this very hour i often puzzle myself with it ,MobyDick or The Whale
now take away the awful fear and my sensations at feeling the supernatural hand in mine were very similar in their strangeness to those which i experienced on waking up and seeing queequegs pagan arm thrown round me but at length all the past nights events soberly recurred one by one in fixed reality and then i lay only alive to the comical predicament for though i tried to move his armunlock his bridegroom claspyet sleeping as he was he still hugged me tightly as though naught but death should part us twain i now strove to rouse himqueequegbut his only answer was a snore i then rolled over my neck feeling as if it were in a horsecollar and suddenly felt a slight scratch throwing aside the counterpane there lay the tomahawk sleeping by the savages side as if it were a hatchetfaced baby a pretty pickle truly thought i abed here in a strange house in the broad day with a cannibal and a tomahawk queequegin the name of goodness queequeg wake at length by dint of much wriggling and loud and incessant expostulations upon the unbecomingness of his hugging a fellow male in that matrimonial sort of style i succeeded in extracting a grunt and presently he drew back his arm shook himself all over like a newfoundland dog just from the water and sat up in bed stiff as a pikestaff looking at me and rubbing his eyes as if he did not altogether remember how i came to be there though a dim consciousness of knowing something about me seemed slowly dawning over him meanwhile i lay quietly eyeing him having no serious misgivings now and bent upon narrowly observing so curious a creature when at last his mind seemed made up touching the character of his bedfellow and he became as it were reconciled to the fact he jumped out upon the floor and by certain signs and sounds gave me to understand that if it pleased me he would dress first and then leave me to dress afterwards leaving the whole apartment to myself thinks i queequeg under the circumstances this is a very civilized overture but the truth is these savages have an innate sense of delicacy say what you will it is marvellous how essentially polite they are i pay this particular compliment to queequeg because he treated me with so much civility and consideration while i was guilty of great rudeness staring at him from the bed and watching all his toilette motions for the time my curiosity getting the better of my breeding nevertheless a man like queequeg you dont see every day he and his ways were well worth unusual regarding ,MobyDick or The Whale
he commenced dressing at top by donning his beaver hat a very tall one by the by and thenstill minus his trowsershe hunted up his boots what under the heavens he did it for i cannot tell but his next movement was to crush himselfboots in hand and hat onunder the bed when from sundry violent gaspings and strainings i inferred he was hard at work booting himself though by no law of propriety that i ever heard of is any man required to be private when putting on his boots but queequeg do you see was a creature in the transition stageneither caterpillar nor butterfly he was just enough civilized to show off his outlandishness in the strangest possible manners his education was not yet completed he was an undergraduate if he had not been a small degree civilized he very probably would not have troubled himself with boots at all but then if he had not been still a savage he never would have dreamt of getting under the bed to put them on at last he emerged with his hat very much dented and crushed down over his eyes and began creaking and limping about the room as if not being much accustomed to boots his pair of damp wrinkled cowhide onesprobably not made to order eitherrather pinched and tormented him at the first go off of a bitter cold morning ,MobyDick or The Whale
seeing now that there were no curtains to the window and that the street being very narrow the house opposite commanded a plain view into the room and observing more and more the indecorous figure that queequeg made staving about with little else but his hat and boots on i begged him as well as i could to accelerate his toilet somewhat and particularly to get into his pantaloons as soon as possible he complied and then proceeded to wash himself at that time in the morning any christian would have washed his face but queequeg to my amazement contented himself with restricting his ablutions to his chest arms and hands he then donned his waistcoat and taking up a piece of hard soap on the washstand centre table dipped it into water and commenced lathering his face i was watching to see where he kept his razor when lo and behold he takes the harpoon from the bed corner slips out the long wooden stock unsheathes the head whets it a little on his boot and striding up to the bit of mirror against the wall begins a vigorous scraping or rather harpooning of his cheeks thinks i queequeg this is using rogerss best cutlery with a vengeance afterwards i wondered the less at this operation when i came to know of what fine steel the head of a harpoon is made and how exceedingly sharp the long straight edges are always kept ,MobyDick or The Whale
i quickly followed suit and descending into the barroom accosted the grinning landlord very pleasantly i cherished no malice towards him though he had been skylarking with me not a little in the matter of my bedfellow ,MobyDick or The Whale
however a good laugh is a mighty good thing and rather too scarce a good thing the mores the pity so if any one man in his own proper person afford stuff for a good joke to anybody let him not be backward but let him cheerfully allow himself to spend and be spent in that way and the man that has anything bountifully laughable about him be sure there is more in that man than you perhaps think for ,MobyDick or The Whale
the barroom was now full of the boarders who had been dropping in the night previous and whom i had not as yet had a good look at they were nearly all whalemen chief mates and second mates and third mates and sea carpenters and sea coopers and sea blacksmiths and harpooneers and ship keepers a brown and brawny company with bosky beards an unshorn shaggy set all wearing monkey jackets for morning gowns ,MobyDick or The Whale
you could pretty plainly tell how long each one had been ashore this young fellows healthy cheek is like a suntoasted pear in hue and would seem to smell almost as musky he cannot have been three days landed from his indian voyage that man next him looks a few shades lighter you might say a touch of satin wood is in him in the complexion of a third still lingers a tropic tawn but slightly bleached withal he doubtless has tarried whole weeks ashore but who could show a cheek like queequeg which barred with various tints seemed like the andes western slope to show forth in one array contrasting climates zone by zone ,MobyDick or The Whale
they say that men who have seen the world thereby become quite at ease in manner quite selfpossessed in company not always though ledyard the great new england traveller and mungo park the scotch one of all men they possessed the least assurance in the parlor but perhaps the mere crossing of siberia in a sledge drawn by dogs as ledyard did or the taking a long solitary walk on an empty stomach in the negro heart of africa which was the sum of poor mungos performancesthis kind of travel i say may not be the very best mode of attaining a high social polish still for the most part that sort of thing is to be had anywhere ,MobyDick or The Whale
these reflections just here are occasioned by the circumstance that after we were all seated at the table and i was preparing to hear some good stories about whaling to my no small surprise nearly every man maintained a profound silence and not only that but they looked embarrassed yes here were a set of seadogs many of whom without the slightest bashfulness had boarded great whales on the high seasentire strangers to themand duelled them dead without winking and yet here they sat at a social breakfast tableall of the same calling all of kindred tasteslooking round as sheepishly at each other as though they had never been out of sight of some sheepfold among the green mountains a curious sight these bashful bears these timid warrior whalemen ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as for queequegwhy queequeg sat there among themat the head of the table too it so chanced as cool as an icicle to be sure i cannot say much for his breeding his greatest admirer could not have cordially justified his bringing his harpoon into breakfast with him and using it there without ceremony reaching over the table with it to the imminent jeopardy of many heads and grappling the beefsteaks towards him but that was certainly very coolly done by him and every one knows that in most peoples estimation to do anything coolly is to do it genteelly ,MobyDick or The Whale
we will not speak of all queequegs peculiarities here how he eschewed coffee and hot rolls and applied his undivided attention to beefsteaks done rare enough that when breakfast was over he withdrew like the rest into the public room lighted his tomahawkpipe and was sitting there quietly digesting and smoking with his inseparable hat on when i sallied out for a stroll ,MobyDick or The Whale
if i had been astonished at first catching a glimpse of so outlandish an individual as queequeg circulating among the polite society of a civilized town that astonishment soon departed upon taking my first daylight stroll through the streets of new bedford ,MobyDick or The Whale
in thoroughfares nigh the docks any considerable seaport will frequently offer to view the queerest looking nondescripts from foreign parts even in broadway and chestnut streets mediterranean mariners will sometimes jostle the affrighted ladies regent street is not unknown to lascars and malays and at bombay in the apollo green live yankees have often scared the natives but new bedford beats all water street and wapping in these lastmentioned haunts you see only sailors but in new bedford actual cannibals stand chatting at street corners savages outright many of whom yet carry on their bones unholy flesh it makes a stranger stare ,MobyDick or The Whale
but besides the feegeeans tongatobooarrs erromanggoans pannangians and brighggians and besides the wild specimens of the whalingcraft which unheeded reel about the streets you will see other sights still more curious certainly more comical there weekly arrive in this town scores of green vermonters and new hampshire men all athirst for gain and glory in the fishery they are mostly young of stalwart frames fellows who have felled forests and now seek to drop the axe and snatch the whalelance many are as green as the green mountains whence they came in some things you would think them but a few hours old look there that chap strutting round the corner he wears a beaver hat and swallowtailed coat girdled with a sailorbelt and sheathknife here comes another with a souwester and a bombazine cloak ,MobyDick or The Whale
no townbred dandy will compare with a countrybred onei mean a downright bumpkin dandya fellow that in the dogdays will mow his two acres in buckskin gloves for fear of tanning his hands now when a country dandy like this takes it into his head to make a distinguished reputation and joins the great whalefishery you should see the comical things he does upon reaching the seaport in bespeaking his seaoutfit he orders bellbuttons to his waistcoats straps to his canvas trowsers ah poor hayseed how bitterly will burst those straps in the first howling gale when thou art driven straps buttons and all down the throat of the tempest ,MobyDick or The Whale
but think not that this famous town has only harpooneers cannibals and bumpkins to show her visitors not at all still new bedford is a queer place had it not been for us whalemen that tract of land would this day perhaps have been in as howling condition as the coast of labrador as it is parts of her back country are enough to frighten one they look so bony the town itself is perhaps the dearest place to live in in all new england it is a land of oil true enough but not like canaan a land also of corn and wine the streets do not run with milk nor in the springtime do they pave them with fresh eggs yet in spite of this nowhere in all america will you find more patricianlike houses parks and gardens more opulent than in new bedford whence came they how planted upon this once scraggy scoria of a country ,MobyDick or The Whale
go and gaze upon the iron emblematical harpoons round yonder lofty mansion and your question will be answered yes all these brave houses and flowery gardens came from the atlantic pacific and indian oceans one and all they were harpooned and dragged up hither from the bottom of the sea can herr alexander perform a feat like that ,MobyDick or The Whale
in new bedford fathers they say give whales for dowers to their daughters and portion off their nieces with a few porpoises apiece you must go to new bedford to see a brilliant wedding for they say they have reservoirs of oil in every house and every night recklessly burn their lengths in spermaceti candles ,MobyDick or The Whale
in summer time the town is sweet to see full of fine mapleslong avenues of green and gold and in august high in air the beautiful and bountiful horsechestnuts candelabrawise proffer the passerby their tapering upright cones of congregated blossoms so omnipotent is art which in many a district of new bedford has superinduced bright terraces of flowers upon the barren refuse rocks thrown aside at creations final day ,MobyDick or The Whale
and the women of new bedford they bloom like their own red roses but roses only bloom in summer whereas the fine carnation of their cheeks is perennial as sunlight in the seventh heavens elsewhere match that bloom of theirs ye cannot save in salem where they tell me the young girls breathe such musk their sailor sweethearts smell them miles off shore as though they were drawing nigh the odorous moluccas instead of the puritanic sands ,MobyDick or The Whale
returning from my first morning stroll i again sallied out upon this special errand the sky had changed from clear sunny cold to driving sleet and mist wrapping myself in my shaggy jacket of the cloth called bearskin i fought my way against the stubborn storm entering i found a small scattered congregation of sailors and sailors wives and widows a muffled silence reigned only broken at times by the shrieks of the storm each silent worshipper seemed purposely sitting apart from the other as if each silent grief were insular and incommunicable the chaplain had not yet arrived and there these silent islands of men and women sat steadfastly eyeing several marble tablets with black borders masoned into the wall on either side the pulpit three of them ran something like the following but i do not pretend to quote ,MobyDick or The Whale
sacred to the memory of robert long willis ellery nathan coleman walter canny seth macy and samuel gleig forming one of the boats crews of the ship eliza who were towed out of sight by a whale on the offshore ground in the pacific december st  this marble is here placed by their surviving shipmates ,MobyDick or The Whale
shaking off the sleet from my iceglazed hat and jacket i seated myself near the door and turning sideways was surprised to see queequeg near me affected by the solemnity of the scene there was a wondering gaze of incredulous curiosity in his countenance this savage was the only person present who seemed to notice my entrance because he was the only one who could not read and therefore was not reading those frigid inscriptions on the wall whether any of the relatives of the seamen whose names appeared there were now among the congregation i knew not but so many are the unrecorded accidents in the fishery and so plainly did several women present wear the countenance if not the trappings of some unceasing grief that i feel sure that here before me were assembled those in whose unhealing hearts the sight of those bleak tablets sympathetically caused the old wounds to bleed afresh ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh ye whose dead lie buried beneath the green grass who standing among flowers can sayhere here lies my beloved ye know not the desolation that broods in bosoms like these what bitter blanks in those blackbordered marbles which cover no ashes what despair in those immovable inscriptions what deadly voids and unbidden infidelities in the lines that seem to gnaw upon all faith and refuse resurrections to the beings who have placelessly perished without a grave as well might those tablets stand in the cave of elephanta as here ,MobyDick or The Whale
in what census of living creatures the dead of mankind are included why it is that a universal proverb says of them that they tell no tales though containing more secrets than the goodwin sands how it is that to his name who yesterday departed for the other world we prefix so significant and infidel a word and yet do not thus entitle him if he but embarks for the remotest indies of this living earth why the life insurance companies pay deathforfeitures upon immortals in what eternal unstirring paralysis and deadly hopeless trance yet lies antique adam who died sixty round centuries ago how it is that we still refuse to be comforted for those who we nevertheless maintain are dwelling in unspeakable bliss why all the living so strive to hush all the dead wherefore but the rumor of a knocking in a tomb will terrify a whole city all these things are not without their meanings ,MobyDick or The Whale
it needs scarcely to be told with what feelings on the eve of a nantucket voyage i regarded those marble tablets and by the murky light of that darkened doleful day read the fate of the whalemen who had gone before me yes ishmael the same fate may be thine but somehow i grew merry again delightful inducements to embark fine chance for promotion it seemsaye a stove boat will make me an immortal by brevet yes there is death in this business of whalinga speechlessly quick chaotic bundling of a man into eternity but what then methinks we have hugely mistaken this matter of life and death methinks that what they call my shadow here on earth is my true substance methinks that in looking at things spiritual we are too much like oysters observing the sun through the water and thinking that thick water the thinnest of air methinks my body is but the lees of my better being in fact take my body who will take it i say it is not me and therefore three cheers for nantucket and come a stove boat and stove body when they will for stave my soul jove himself cannot ,MobyDick or The Whale
i had not been seated very long ere a man of a certain venerable robustness entered immediately as the stormpelted door flew back upon admitting him a quick regardful eyeing of him by all the congregation sufficiently attested that this fine old man was the chaplain yes it was the famous father mapple so called by the whalemen among whom he was a very great favourite he had been a sailor and a harpooneer in his youth but for many years past had dedicated his life to the ministry at the time i now write of father mapple was in the hardy winter of a healthy old age that sort of old age which seems merging into a second flowering youth for among all the fissures of his wrinkles there shone certain mild gleams of a newly developing bloomthe spring verdure peeping forth even beneath februarys snow no one having previously heard his history could for the first time behold father mapple without the utmost interest because there were certain engrafted clerical peculiarities about him imputable to that adventurous maritime life he had led when he entered i observed that he carried no umbrella and certainly had not come in his carriage for his tarpaulin hat ran down with melting sleet and his great pilot cloth jacket seemed almost to drag him to the floor with the weight of the water it had absorbed however hat and coat and overshoes were one by one removed and hung up in a little space in an adjacent corner when arrayed in a decent suit he quietly approached the pulpit ,MobyDick or The Whale
like most old fashioned pulpits it was a very lofty one and since a regular stairs to such a height would by its long angle with the floor seriously contract the already small area of the chapel the architect it seemed had acted upon the hint of father mapple and finished the pulpit without a stairs substituting a perpendicular side ladder like those used in mounting a ship from a boat at sea the wife of a whaling captain had provided the chapel with a handsome pair of red worsted manropes for this ladder which being itself nicely headed and stained with a mahogany colour the whole contrivance considering what manner of chapel it was seemed by no means in bad taste halting for an instant at the foot of the ladder and with both hands grasping the ornamental knobs of the manropes father mapple cast a look upwards and then with a truly sailorlike but still reverential dexterity hand over hand mounted the steps as if ascending the maintop of his vessel ,MobyDick or The Whale
the perpendicular parts of this side ladder as is usually the case with swinging ones were of clothcovered rope only the rounds were of wood so that at every step there was a joint at my first glimpse of the pulpit it had not escaped me that however convenient for a ship these joints in the present instance seemed unnecessary for i was not prepared to see father mapple after gaining the height slowly turn round and stooping over the pulpit deliberately drag up the ladder step by step till the whole was deposited within leaving him impregnable in his little quebec ,MobyDick or The Whale
i pondered some time without fully comprehending the reason for this father mapple enjoyed such a wide reputation for sincerity and sanctity that i could not suspect him of courting notoriety by any mere tricks of the stage no thought i there must be some sober reason for this thing furthermore it must symbolize something unseen can it be then that by that act of physical isolation he signifies his spiritual withdrawal for the time from all outward worldly ties and connexions yes for replenished with the meat and wine of the word to the faithful man of god this pulpit i see is a selfcontaining strongholda lofty ehrenbreitstein with a perennial well of water within the walls ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the side ladder was not the only strange feature of the place borrowed from the chaplains former seafarings between the marble cenotaphs on either hand of the pulpit the wall which formed its back was adorned with a large painting representing a gallant ship beating against a terrible storm off a lee coast of black rocks and snowy breakers but high above the flying scud and darkrolling clouds there floated a little isle of sunlight from which beamed forth an angels face and this bright face shed a distinct spot of radiance upon the ships tossed deck something like that silver plate now inserted into the victorys plank where nelson fell ah noble ship the angel seemed to say beat on beat on thou noble ship and bear a hardy helm for lo the sun is breaking through the clouds are rolling offserenest azure is at hand ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor was the pulpit itself without a trace of the same seataste that had achieved the ladder and the picture its panelled front was in the likeness of a ships bluff bows and the holy bible rested on a projecting piece of scroll work fashioned after a ships fiddleheaded beak ,MobyDick or The Whale
what could be more full of meaningfor the pulpit is ever this earths foremost part all the rest comes in its rear the pulpit leads the world from thence it is the storm of gods quick wrath is first descried and the bow must bear the earliest brunt from thence it is the god of breezes fair or foul is first invoked for favourable winds yes the worlds a ship on its passage out and not a voyage complete and the pulpit is its prow ,MobyDick or The Whale
he paused a little then kneeling in the pulpits bows folded his large brown hands across his chest uplifted his closed eyes and offered a prayer so deeply devout that he seemed kneeling and praying at the bottom of the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
this ended in prolonged solemn tones like the continual tolling of a bell in a ship that is foundering at sea in a fogin such tones he commenced reading the following hymn but changing his manner towards the concluding stanzas burst forth with a pealing exultation and joy ,MobyDick or The Whale
nearly all joined in singing this hymn which swelled high above the howling of the storm a brief pause ensued the preacher slowly turned over the leaves of the bible and at last folding his hand down upon the proper page said beloved shipmates clinch the last verse of the first chapter of jonahand god had prepared a great fish to swallow up jonah ,MobyDick or The Whale
shipmates this book containing only four chaptersfour yarnsis one of the smallest strands in the mighty cable of the scriptures yet what depths of the soul does jonahs deep sealine sound what a pregnant lesson to us is this prophet what a noble thing is that canticle in the fishs belly how billowlike and boisterously grand we feel the floods surging over us we sound with him to the kelpy bottom of the waters seaweed and all the slime of the sea is about us but what is this lesson that the book of jonah teaches shipmates it is a twostranded lesson a lesson to us all as sinful men and a lesson to me as a pilot of the living god as sinful men it is a lesson to us all because it is a story of the sin hardheartedness suddenly awakened fears the swift punishment repentance prayers and finally the deliverance and joy of jonah as with all sinners among men the sin of this son of amittai was in his wilful disobedience of the command of godnever mind now what that command was or how conveyedwhich he found a hard command but all the things that god would have us do are hard for us to doremember thatand hence he oftener commands us than endeavors to persuade and if we obey god we must disobey ourselves and it is in this disobeying ourselves wherein the hardness of obeying god consists ,MobyDick or The Whale
with this sin of disobedience in him jonah still further flouts at god by seeking to flee from him he thinks that a ship made by men will carry him into countries where god does not reign but only the captains of this earth he skulks about the wharves of joppa and seeks a ship thats bound for tarshish there lurks perhaps a hitherto unheeded meaning here by all accounts tarshish could have been no other city than the modern cadiz thats the opinion of learned men and where is cadiz shipmates cadiz is in spain as far by water from joppa as jonah could possibly have sailed in those ancient days when the atlantic was an almost unknown sea because joppa the modern jaffa shipmates is on the most easterly coast of the mediterranean the syrian and tarshish or cadiz more than two thousand miles to the westward from that just outside the straits of gibraltar see ye not then shipmates that jonah sought to flee worldwide from god miserable man oh most contemptible and worthy of all scorn with slouched hat and guilty eye skulking from his god prowling among the shipping like a vile burglar hastening to cross the seas so disordered selfcondemning is his look that had there been policemen in those days jonah on the mere suspicion of something wrong had been arrested ere he touched a deck how plainly hes a fugitive no baggage not a hatbox valise or carpetbagno friends accompany him to the wharf with their adieux at last after much dodging search he finds the tarshish ship receiving the last items of her cargo and as he steps on board to see its captain in the cabin all the sailors for the moment desist from hoisting in the goods to mark the strangers evil eye jonah sees this but in vain he tries to look all ease and confidence in vain essays his wretched smile strong intuitions of the man assure the mariners he can be no innocent in their gamesome but still serious way one whispers to the otherjack hes robbed a widow or joe do you mark him hes a bigamist or harry lad i guess hes the adulterer that broke jail in old gomorrah or belike one of the missing murderers from sodom another runs to read the bill thats stuck against the spile upon the wharf to which the ship is moored offering five hundred gold coins for the apprehension of a parricide and containing a description of his person he reads and looks from jonah to the bill while all his sympathetic shipmates now crowd round jonah prepared to lay their hands upon him frighted jonah trembles and summoning all his boldness to his face only looks so much the more a coward he will not confess himself suspected but that itself is strong suspicion so he makes the best of it and when the sailors find him not to be the man that is advertised they let him pass and he descends into the cabin ,MobyDick or The Whale
whos there cries the captain at his busy desk hurriedly making out his papers for the customswhos there oh how that harmless question mangles jonah for the instant he almost turns to flee again but he rallies i seek a passage in this ship to tarshish how soon sail ye sir thus far the busy captain had not looked up to jonah though the man now stands before him but no sooner does he hear that hollow voice than he darts a scrutinizing glance we sail with the next coming tide at last he slowly answered still intently eyeing him no sooner sirsoon enough for any honest man that goes a passenger ha jonah thats another stab but he swiftly calls away the captain from that scent ill sail with yehe saysthe passage money how much is thatill pay now for it is particularly written shipmates as if it were a thing not to be overlooked in this history that he paid the fare thereof ere the craft did sail and taken with the context this is full of meaning ,MobyDick or The Whale
now jonahs captain shipmates was one whose discernment detects crime in any but whose cupidity exposes it only in the penniless in this world shipmates sin that pays its way can travel freely and without a passport whereas virtue if a pauper is stopped at all frontiers so jonahs captain prepares to test the length of jonahs purse ere he judge him openly he charges him thrice the usual sum and its assented to then the captain knows that jonah is a fugitive but at the same time resolves to help a flight that paves its rear with gold yet when jonah fairly takes out his purse prudent suspicions still molest the captain he rings every coin to find a counterfeit not a forger any way he mutters and jonah is put down for his passage point out my stateroom sir says jonah now im travelweary i need sleep thou lookest like it says the captain theres thy room jonah enters and would lock the door but the lock contains no key hearing him foolishly fumbling there the captain laughs lowly to himself and mutters something about the doors of convicts cells being never allowed to be locked within all dressed and dusty as he is jonah throws himself into his berth and finds the little stateroom ceiling almost resting on his forehead the air is close and jonah gasps then in that contracted hole sunk too beneath the ships waterline jonah feels the heralding presentiment of that stifling hour when the whale shall hold him in the smallest of his bowels wards ,MobyDick or The Whale
screwed at its axis against the side a swinging lamp slightly oscillates in jonahs room and the ship heeling over towards the wharf with the weight of the last bales received the lamp flame and all though in slight motion still maintains a permanent obliquity with reference to the room though in truth infallibly straight itself it but made obvious the false lying levels among which it hung the lamp alarms and frightens jonah as lying in his berth his tormented eyes roll round the place and this thus far successful fugitive finds no refuge for his restless glance but that contradiction in the lamp more and more appals him the floor the ceiling and the side are all awry oh so my conscience hangs in me he groans straight upwards so it burns but the chambers of my soul are all in crookedness ,MobyDick or The Whale
like one who after a night of drunken revelry hies to his bed still reeling but with conscience yet pricking him as the plungings of the roman racehorse but so much the more strike his steel tags into him as one who in that miserable plight still turns and turns in giddy anguish praying god for annihilation until the fit be passed and at last amid the whirl of woe he feels a deep stupor steals over him as over the man who bleeds to death for conscience is the wound and theres naught to staunch it so after sore wrestlings in his berth jonahs prodigy of ponderous misery drags him drowning down to sleep ,MobyDick or The Whale
and now the time of tide has come the ship casts off her cables and from the deserted wharf the uncheered ship for tarshish all careening glides to sea that ship my friends was the first of recorded smugglers the contraband was jonah but the sea rebels he will not bear the wicked burden a dreadful storm comes on the ship is like to break but now when the boatswain calls all hands to lighten her when boxes bales and jars are clattering overboard when the wind is shrieking and the men are yelling and every plank thunders with trampling feet right over jonahs head in all this raging tumult jonah sleeps his hideous sleep he sees no black sky and raging sea feels not the reeling timbers and little hears he or heeds he the far rush of the mighty whale which even now with open mouth is cleaving the seas after him aye shipmates jonah was gone down into the sides of the shipa berth in the cabin as i have taken it and was fast asleep but the frightened master comes to him and shrieks in his dead ear what meanest thou o sleeper arise startled from his lethargy by that direful cry jonah staggers to his feet and stumbling to the deck grasps a shroud to look out upon the sea but at that moment he is sprung upon by a panther billow leaping over the bulwarks wave after wave thus leaps into the ship and finding no speedy vent runs roaring fore and aft till the mariners come nigh to drowning while yet afloat and ever as the white moon shows her affrighted face from the steep gullies in the blackness overhead aghast jonah sees the rearing bowsprit pointing high upward but soon beat downward again towards the tormented deep ,MobyDick or The Whale
terrors upon terrors run shouting through his soul in all his cringing attitudes the godfugitive is now too plainly known the sailors mark him more and more certain grow their suspicions of him and at last fully to test the truth by referring the whole matter to high heaven they fall to casting lots to see for whose cause this great tempest was upon them the lot is jonahs that discovered then how furiously they mob him with their questions what is thine occupation whence comest thou thy country what people but mark now my shipmates the behavior of poor jonah the eager mariners but ask him who he is and where from whereas they not only receive an answer to those questions but likewise another answer to a question not put by them but the unsolicited answer is forced from jonah by the hard hand of god that is upon him ,MobyDick or The Whale
i am a hebrew he criesand theni fear the lord the god of heaven who hath made the sea and the dry land fear him o jonah aye well mightest thou fear the lord god then straightway he now goes on to make a full confession whereupon the mariners became more and more appalled but still are pitiful for when jonah not yet supplicating god for mercy since he but too well knew the darkness of his desertswhen wretched jonah cries out to them to take him and cast him forth into the sea for he knew that for his sake this great tempest was upon them they mercifully turn from him and seek by other means to save the ship but all in vain the indignant gale howls louder then with one hand raised invokingly to god with the other they not unreluctantly lay hold of jonah ,MobyDick or The Whale
and now behold jonah taken up as an anchor and dropped into the sea when instantly an oily calmness floats out from the east and the sea is still as jonah carries down the gale with him leaving smooth water behind he goes down in the whirling heart of such a masterless commotion that he scarce heeds the moment when he drops seething into the yawning jaws awaiting him and the whale shootsto all his ivory teeth like so many white bolts upon his prison then jonah prayed unto the lord out of the fishs belly but observe his prayer and learn a weighty lesson for sinful as he is jonah does not weep and wail for direct deliverance he feels that his dreadful punishment is just he leaves all his deliverance to god contenting himself with this that spite of all his pains and pangs he will still look towards his holy temple and here shipmates is true and faithful repentance not clamorous for pardon but grateful for punishment and how pleasing to god was this conduct in jonah is shown in the eventual deliverance of him from the sea and the whale shipmates i do not place jonah before you to be copied for his sin but i do place him before you as a model for repentance sin not but if you do take heed to repent of it like jonah ,MobyDick or The Whale
while he was speaking these words the howling of the shrieking slanting storm without seemed to add new power to the preacher who when describing jonahs seastorm seemed tossed by a storm himself his deep chest heaved as with a groundswell his tossed arms seemed the warring elements at work and the thunders that rolled away from off his swarthy brow and the light leaping from his eye made all his simple hearers look on him with a quick fear that was strange to them ,MobyDick or The Whale
shipmates god has laid but one hand upon you both his hands press upon me i have read ye by what murky light may be mine the lesson that jonah teaches to all sinners and therefore to ye and still more to me for i am a greater sinner than ye and now how gladly would i come down from this masthead and sit on the hatches there where you sit and listen as you listen while some one of you reads me that other and more awful lesson which jonah teaches to me as a pilot of the living god how being an anointed pilotprophet or speaker of true things and bidden by the lord to sound those unwelcome truths in the ears of a wicked nineveh jonah appalled at the hostility he should raise fled from his mission and sought to escape his duty and his god by taking ship at joppa but god is everywhere tarshish he never reached as we have seen god came upon him in the whale and swallowed him down to living gulfs of doom and with swift slantings tore him along into the midst of the seas where the eddying depths sucked him ten thousand fathoms down and the weeds were wrapped about his head and all the watery world of woe bowled over him yet even then beyond the reach of any plummetout of the belly of hellwhen the whale grounded upon the oceans utmost bones even then god heard the engulphed repenting prophet when he cried then god spake unto the fish and from the shuddering cold and blackness of the sea the whale came breeching up towards the warm and pleasant sun and all the delights of air and earth and vomited out jonah upon the dry land when the word of the lord came a second time and jonah bruised and beatenhis ears like two seashells still multitudinously murmuring of the oceanjonah did the almightys bidding and what was that shipmates to preach the truth to the face of falsehood that was it ,MobyDick or The Whale
this shipmates this is that other lesson and woe to that pilot of the living god who slights it woe to him whom this world charms from gospel duty woe to him who seeks to pour oil upon the waters when god has brewed them into a gale woe to him who seeks to please rather than to appal woe to him whose good name is more to him than goodness woe to him who in this world courts not dishonor woe to him who would not be true even though to be false were salvation yea woe to him who as the great pilot paul has it while preaching to others is himself a castaway ,MobyDick or The Whale
he dropped and fell away from himself for a moment then lifting his face to them again showed a deep joy in his eyes as he cried out with a heavenly enthusiasmbut oh shipmates on the starboard hand of every woe there is a sure delight and higher the top of that delight than the bottom of the woe is deep is not the maintruck higher than the kelson is low delight is to hima far far upward and inward delightwho against the proud gods and commodores of this earth ever stands forth his own inexorable self delight is to him whose strong arms yet support him when the ship of this base treacherous world has gone down beneath him delight is to him who gives no quarter in the truth and kills burns and destroys all sin though he pluck it out from under the robes of senators and judges delighttopgallant delight is to him who acknowledges no law or lord but the lord his god and is only a patriot to heaven delight is to him whom all the waves of the billows of the seas of the boisterous mob can never shake from this sure keel of the ages and eternal delight and deliciousness will be his who coming to lay him down can say with his final breatho fatherchiefly known to me by thy rodmortal or immortal here i die i have striven to be thine more than to be this worlds or mine own yet this is nothing i leave eternity to thee for what is man that he should live out the lifetime of his god ,MobyDick or The Whale
returning to the spouterinn from the chapel i found queequeg there quite alone he having left the chapel before the benediction some time he was sitting on a bench before the fire with his feet on the stove hearth and in one hand was holding close up to his face that little negro idol of his peering hard into its face and with a jackknife gently whittling away at its nose meanwhile humming to himself in his heathenish way ,MobyDick or The Whale
but being now interrupted he put up the image and pretty soon going to the table took up a large book there and placing it on his lap began counting the pages with deliberate regularity at every fiftieth pageas i fanciedstopping a moment looking vacantly around him and giving utterance to a longdrawn gurgling whistle of astonishment he would then begin again at the next fifty seeming to commence at number one each time as though he could not count more than fifty and it was only by such a large number of fifties being found together that his astonishment at the multitude of pages was excited ,MobyDick or The Whale
with much interest i sat watching him savage though he was and hideously marred about the faceat least to my tastehis countenance yet had a something in it which was by no means disagreeable you cannot hide the soul through all his unearthly tattooings i thought i saw the traces of a simple honest heart and in his large deep eyes fiery black and bold there seemed tokens of a spirit that would dare a thousand devils and besides all this there was a certain lofty bearing about the pagan which even his uncouthness could not altogether maim he looked like a man who had never cringed and never had had a creditor whether it was too that his head being shaved his forehead was drawn out in freer and brighter relief and looked more expansive than it otherwise would this i will not venture to decide but certain it was his head was phrenologically an excellent one it may seem ridiculous but it reminded me of general washingtons head as seen in the popular busts of him it had the same long regularly graded retreating slope from above the brows which were likewise very projecting like two long promontories thickly wooded on top queequeg was george washington cannibalistically developed ,MobyDick or The Whale
whilst i was thus closely scanning him halfpretending meanwhile to be looking out at the storm from the casement he never heeded my presence never troubled himself with so much as a single glance but appeared wholly occupied with counting the pages of the marvellous book considering how sociably we had been sleeping together the night previous and especially considering the affectionate arm i had found thrown over me upon waking in the morning i thought this indifference of his very strange but savages are strange beings at times you do not know exactly how to take them at first they are overawing their calm selfcollectedness of simplicity seems a socratic wisdom i had noticed also that queequeg never consorted at all or but very little with the other seamen in the inn he made no advances whatever appeared to have no desire to enlarge the circle of his acquaintances all this struck me as mighty singular yet upon second thoughts there was something almost sublime in it here was a man some twenty thousand miles from home by the way of cape horn that iswhich was the only way he could get therethrown among people as strange to him as though he were in the planet jupiter and yet he seemed entirely at his ease preserving the utmost serenity content with his own companionship always equal to himself surely this was a touch of fine philosophy though no doubt he had never heard there was such a thing as that but perhaps to be true philosophers we mortals should not be conscious of so living or so striving so soon as i hear that such or such a man gives himself out for a philosopher i conclude that like the dyspeptic old woman he must have broken his digester ,MobyDick or The Whale
as i sat there in that now lonely room the fire burning low in that mild stage when after its first intensity has warmed the air it then only glows to be looked at the evening shades and phantoms gathering round the casements and peering in upon us silent solitary twain the storm booming without in solemn swells i began to be sensible of strange feelings i felt a melting in me no more my splintered heart and maddened hand were turned against the wolfish world this soothing savage had redeemed it there he sat his very indifference speaking a nature in which there lurked no civilized hypocrisies and bland deceits wild he was a very sight of sights to see yet i began to feel myself mysteriously drawn towards him and those same things that would have repelled most others they were the very magnets that thus drew me ill try a pagan friend thought i since christian kindness has proved but hollow courtesy i drew my bench near him and made some friendly signs and hints doing my best to talk with him meanwhile at first he little noticed these advances but presently upon my referring to his last nights hospitalities he made out to ask me whether we were again to be bedfellows i told him yes whereat i thought he looked pleased perhaps a little complimented ,MobyDick or The Whale
we then turned over the book together and i endeavored to explain to him the purpose of the printing and the meaning of the few pictures that were in it thus i soon engaged his interest and from that we went to jabbering the best we could about the various outer sights to be seen in this famous town soon i proposed a social smoke and producing his pouch and tomahawk he quietly offered me a puff and then we sat exchanging puffs from that wild pipe of his and keeping it regularly passing between us ,MobyDick or The Whale
if there yet lurked any ice of indifference towards me in the pagans breast this pleasant genial smoke we had soon thawed it out and left us cronies he seemed to take to me quite as naturally and unbiddenly as i to him and when our smoke was over he pressed his forehead against mine clasped me round the waist and said that henceforth we were married meaning in his countrys phrase that we were bosom friends he would gladly die for me if need should be in a countryman this sudden flame of friendship would have seemed far too premature a thing to be much distrusted but in this simple savage those old rules would not apply ,MobyDick or The Whale
after supper and another social chat and smoke we went to our room together he made me a present of his embalmed head took out his enormous tobacco wallet and groping under the tobacco drew out some thirty dollars in silver then spreading them on the table and mechanically dividing them into two equal portions pushed one of them towards me and said it was mine i was going to remonstrate but he silenced me by pouring them into my trowsers pockets i let them stay he then went about his evening prayers took out his idol and removed the paper fireboard by certain signs and symptoms i thought he seemed anxious for me to join him but well knowing what was to follow i deliberated a moment whether in case he invited me i would comply or otherwise ,MobyDick or The Whale
i was a good christian born and bred in the bosom of the infallible presbyterian church how then could i unite with this wild idolator in worshipping his piece of wood but what is worship thought i do you suppose now ishmael that the magnanimous god of heaven and earthpagans and all includedcan possibly be jealous of an insignificant bit of black wood impossible but what is worshipto do the will of godthat is worship and what is the will of godto do to my fellow man what i would have my fellow man to do to methat is the will of god now queequeg is my fellow man and what do i wish that this queequeg would do to me why unite with me in my particular presbyterian form of worship consequently i must then unite with him in his ergo i must turn idolator so i kindled the shavings helped prop up the innocent little idol offered him burnt biscuit with queequeg salamed before him twice or thrice kissed his nose and that done we undressed and went to bed at peace with our own consciences and all the world but we did not go to sleep without some little chat ,MobyDick or The Whale
how it is i know not but there is no place like a bed for confidential disclosures between friends man and wife they say there open the very bottom of their souls to each other and some old couples often lie and chat over old times till nearly morning thus then in our hearts honeymoon lay i and queequega cosy loving pair ,MobyDick or The Whale
we had lain thus in bed chatting and napping at short intervals and queequeg now and then affectionately throwing his brown tattooed legs over mine and then drawing them back so entirely sociable and free and easy were we when at last by reason of our confabulations what little nappishness remained in us altogether departed and we felt like getting up again though daybreak was yet some way down the future ,MobyDick or The Whale
yes we became very wakeful so much so that our recumbent position began to grow wearisome and by little and little we found ourselves sitting up the clothes well tucked around us leaning against the headboard with our four knees drawn up close together and our two noses bending over them as if our kneepans were warmingpans we felt very nice and snug the more so since it was so chilly out of doors indeed out of bedclothes too seeing that there was no fire in the room the more so i say because truly to enjoy bodily warmth some small part of you must be cold for there is no quality in this world that is not what it is merely by contrast nothing exists in itself if you flatter yourself that you are all over comfortable and have been so a long time then you cannot be said to be comfortable any more but if like queequeg and me in the bed the tip of your nose or the crown of your head be slightly chilled why then indeed in the general consciousness you feel most delightfully and unmistakably warm for this reason a sleeping apartment should never be furnished with a fire which is one of the luxurious discomforts of the rich for the height of this sort of deliciousness is to have nothing but the blanket between you and your snugness and the cold of the outer air then there you lie like the one warm spark in the heart of an arctic crystal ,MobyDick or The Whale
we had been sitting in this crouching manner for some time when all at once i thought i would open my eyes for when between sheets whether by day or by night and whether asleep or awake i have a way of always keeping my eyes shut in order the more to concentrate the snugness of being in bed because no man can ever feel his own identity aright except his eyes be closed as if darkness were indeed the proper element of our essences though light be more congenial to our clayey part upon opening my eyes then and coming out of my own pleasant and selfcreated darkness into the imposed and coarse outer gloom of the unilluminated twelveoclockatnight i experienced a disagreeable revulsion nor did i at all object to the hint from queequeg that perhaps it were best to strike a light seeing that we were so wide awake and besides he felt a strong desire to have a few quiet puffs from his tomahawk be it said that though i had felt such a strong repugnance to his smoking in the bed the night before yet see how elastic our stiff prejudices grow when love once comes to bend them for now i liked nothing better than to have queequeg smoking by me even in bed because he seemed to be full of such serene household joy then i no more felt unduly concerned for the landlords policy of insurance i was only alive to the condensed confidential comfortableness of sharing a pipe and a blanket with a real friend with our shaggy jackets drawn about our shoulders we now passed the tomahawk from one to the other till slowly there grew over us a blue hanging tester of smoke illuminated by the flame of the newlit lamp ,MobyDick or The Whale
whether it was that this undulating tester rolled the savage away to far distant scenes i know not but he now spoke of his native island and eager to hear his history i begged him to go on and tell it he gladly complied though at the time i but ill comprehended not a few of his words yet subsequent disclosures when i had become more familiar with his broken phraseology now enable me to present the whole story such as it may prove in the mere skeleton i give ,MobyDick or The Whale
when a newhatched savage running wild about his native woodlands in a grass clout followed by the nibbling goats as if he were a green sapling even then in queequegs ambitious soul lurked a strong desire to see something more of christendom than a specimen whaler or two his father was a high chief a king his uncle a high priest and on the maternal side he boasted aunts who were the wives of unconquerable warriors there was excellent blood in his veinsroyal stuff though sadly vitiated i fear by the cannibal propensity he nourished in his untutored youth ,MobyDick or The Whale
a sag harbor ship visited his fathers bay and queequeg sought a passage to christian lands but the ship having her full complement of seamen spurned his suit and not all the king his fathers influence could prevail but queequeg vowed a vow alone in his canoe he paddled off to a distant strait which he knew the ship must pass through when she quitted the island on one side was a coral reef on the other a low tongue of land covered with mangrove thickets that grew out into the water hiding his canoe still afloat among these thickets with its prow seaward he sat down in the stern paddle low in hand and when the ship was gliding by like a flash he darted out gained her side with one backward dash of his foot capsized and sank his canoe climbed up the chains and throwing himself at full length upon the deck grappled a ringbolt there and swore not to let it go though hacked in pieces ,MobyDick or The Whale
in vain the captain threatened to throw him overboard suspended a cutlass over his naked wrists queequeg was the son of a king and queequeg budged not struck by his desperate dauntlessness and his wild desire to visit christendom the captain at last relented and told him he might make himself at home but this fine young savagethis sea prince of wales never saw the captains cabin they put him down among the sailors and made a whaleman of him but like czar peter content to toil in the shipyards of foreign cities queequeg disdained no seeming ignominy if thereby he might happily gain the power of enlightening his untutored countrymen for at bottomso he told mehe was actuated by a profound desire to learn among the christians the arts whereby to make his people still happier than they were and more than that still better than they were but alas the practices of whalemen soon convinced him that even christians could be both miserable and wicked infinitely more so than all his fathers heathens arrived at last in old sag harbor and seeing what the sailors did there and then going on to nantucket and seeing how they spent their wages in that place also poor queequeg gave it up for lost thought he its a wicked world in all meridians ill die a pagan ,MobyDick or The Whale
by hints i asked him whether he did not propose going back and having a coronation since he might now consider his father dead and gone he being very old and feeble at the last accounts he answered no not yet and added that he was fearful christianity or rather christians had unfitted him for ascending the pure and undefiled throne of thirty pagan kings before him but by and by he said he would returnas soon as he felt himself baptized again for the nonce however he proposed to sail about and sow his wild oats in all four oceans they had made a harpooneer of him and that barbed iron was in lieu of a sceptre now ,MobyDick or The Whale
i asked him what might be his immediate purpose touching his future movements he answered to go to sea again in his old vocation upon this i told him that whaling was my own design and informed him of my intention to sail out of nantucket as being the most promising port for an adventurous whaleman to embark from he at once resolved to accompany me to that island ship aboard the same vessel get into the same watch the same boat the same mess with me in short to share my every hap with both my hands in his boldly dip into the potluck of both worlds to all this i joyously assented for besides the affection i now felt for queequeg he was an experienced harpooneer and as such could not fail to be of great usefulness to one who like me was wholly ignorant of the mysteries of whaling though well acquainted with the sea as known to merchant seamen ,MobyDick or The Whale
his story being ended with his pipes last dying puff queequeg embraced me pressed his forehead against mine and blowing out the light we rolled over from each other this way and that and very soon were sleeping ,MobyDick or The Whale
next morning monday after disposing of the embalmed head to a barber for a block i settled my own and comrades bill using however my comrades money the grinning landlord as well as the boarders seemed amazingly tickled at the sudden friendship which had sprung up between me and queequegespecially as peter coffins cock and bull stories about him had previously so much alarmed me concerning the very person whom i now companied with ,MobyDick or The Whale
we borrowed a wheelbarrow and embarking our things including my own poor carpetbag and queequegs canvas sack and hammock away we went down to the moss the little nantucket packet schooner moored at the wharf as we were going along the people stared not at queequeg so muchfor they were used to seeing cannibals like him in their streetsbut at seeing him and me upon such confidential terms but we heeded them not going along wheeling the barrow by turns and queequeg now and then stopping to adjust the sheath on his harpoon barbs i asked him why he carried such a troublesome thing with him ashore and whether all whaling ships did not find their own harpoons to this in substance he replied that though what i hinted was true enough yet he had a particular affection for his own harpoon because it was of assured stuff well tried in many a mortal combat and deeply intimate with the hearts of whales in short like many inland reapers and mowers who go into the farmers meadows armed with their own scythesthough in no wise obliged to furnish themeven so queequeg for his own private reasons preferred his own harpoon ,MobyDick or The Whale
shifting the barrow from my hand to his he told me a funny story about the first wheelbarrow he had ever seen it was in sag harbor the owners of his ship it seems had lent him one in which to carry his heavy chest to his boarding house not to seem ignorant about the thingthough in truth he was entirely so concerning the precise way in which to manage the barrowqueequeg puts his chest upon it lashes it fast and then shoulders the barrow and marches up the wharf why said i queequeg you might have known better than that one would think didnt the people laugh ,MobyDick or The Whale
upon this he told me another story the people of his island of rokovoko it seems at their wedding feasts express the fragrant water of young cocoanuts into a large stained calabash like a punchbowl and this punchbowl always forms the great central ornament on the braided mat where the feast is held now a certain grand merchant ship once touched at rokovoko and its commanderfrom all accounts a very stately punctilious gentleman at least for a sea captainthis commander was invited to the wedding feast of queequegs sister a pretty young princess just turned of ten well when all the wedding guests were assembled at the brides bamboo cottage this captain marches in and being assigned the post of honor placed himself over against the punchbowl and between the high priest and his majesty the king queequegs father grace being saidfor those people have their grace as well as wethough queequeg told me that unlike us who at such times look downwards to our platters they on the contrary copying the ducks glance upwards to the great giver of all feastsgrace i say being said the high priest opens the banquet by the immemorial ceremony of the island that is dipping his consecrated and consecrating fingers into the bowl before the blessed beverage circulates seeing himself placed next the priest and noting the ceremony and thinking himselfbeing captain of a shipas having plain precedence over a mere island king especially in the kings own housethe captain coolly proceeds to wash his hands in the punchbowltaking it i suppose for a huge fingerglass now said queequeg what you tink nowdidnt our people laugh ,MobyDick or The Whale
at last passage paid and luggage safe we stood on board the schooner hoisting sail it glided down the acushnet river on one side new bedford rose in terraces of streets their icecovered trees all glittering in the clear cold air huge hills and mountains of casks on casks were piled upon her wharves and side by side the worldwandering whale ships lay silent and safely moored at last while from others came a sound of carpenters and coopers with blended noises of fires and forges to melt the pitch all betokening that new cruises were on the start that one most perilous and long voyage ended only begins a second and a second ended only begins a third and so on for ever and for aye such is the endlessness yea the intolerableness of all earthly effort ,MobyDick or The Whale
gaining the more open water the bracing breeze waxed fresh the little moss tossed the quick foam from her bows as a young colt his snortings how i snuffed that tartar airhow i spurned that turnpike earththat common highway all over dented with the marks of slavish heels and hoofs and turned me to admire the magnanimity of the sea which will permit no records ,MobyDick or The Whale
at the same foamfountain queequeg seemed to drink and reel with me his dusky nostrils swelled apart he showed his filed and pointed teeth on on we flew and our offing gained the moss did homage to the blast ducked and dived her bows as a slave before the sultan sideways leaning we sideways darted every ropeyarn tingling like a wire the two tall masts buckling like indian canes in land tornadoes so full of this reeling scene were we as we stood by the plunging bowsprit that for some time we did not notice the jeering glances of the passengers a lubberlike assembly who marvelled that two fellow beings should be so companionable as though a white man were anything more dignified than a whitewashed negro but there were some boobies and bumpkins there who by their intense greenness must have come from the heart and centre of all verdure queequeg caught one of these young saplings mimicking him behind his back i thought the bumpkins hour of doom was come dropping his harpoon the brawny savage caught him in his arms and by an almost miraculous dexterity and strength sent him high up bodily into the air then slightly tapping his stern in midsomerset the fellow landed with bursting lungs upon his feet while queequeg turning his back upon him lighted his tomahawk pipe and passed it to me for a puff ,MobyDick or The Whale
but it so happened just then that it was high time for the captain to mind his own eye the prodigious strain upon the mainsail had parted the weathersheet and the tremendous boom was now flying from side to side completely sweeping the entire after part of the deck the poor fellow whom queequeg had handled so roughly was swept overboard all hands were in a panic and to attempt snatching at the boom to stay it seemed madness it flew from right to left and back again almost in one ticking of a watch and every instant seemed on the point of snapping into splinters nothing was done and nothing seemed capable of being done those on deck rushed towards the bows and stood eyeing the boom as if it were the lower jaw of an exasperated whale in the midst of this consternation queequeg dropped deftly to his knees and crawling under the path of the boom whipped hold of a rope secured one end to the bulwarks and then flinging the other like a lasso caught it round the boom as it swept over his head and at the next jerk the spar was that way trapped and all was safe the schooner was run into the wind and while the hands were clearing away the stern boat queequeg stripped to the waist darted from the side with a long living arc of a leap for three minutes or more he was seen swimming like a dog throwing his long arms straight out before him and by turns revealing his brawny shoulders through the freezing foam i looked at the grand and glorious fellow but saw no one to be saved the greenhorn had gone down shooting himself perpendicularly from the water queequeg now took an instants glance around him and seeming to see just how matters were dived down and disappeared a few minutes more and he rose again one arm still striking out and with the other dragging a lifeless form the boat soon picked them up the poor bumpkin was restored all hands voted queequeg a noble trump the captain begged his pardon from that hour i clove to queequeg like a barnacle yea till poor queequeg took his last long dive ,MobyDick or The Whale
was there ever such unconsciousness he did not seem to think that he at all deserved a medal from the humane and magnanimous societies he only asked for waterfresh watersomething to wipe the brine off that done he put on dry clothes lighted his pipe and leaning against the bulwarks and mildly eyeing those around him seemed to be saying to himselfits a mutual jointstock world in all meridians we cannibals must help these christians ,MobyDick or The Whale
nantucket take out your map and look at it see what a real corner of the world it occupies how it stands there away off shore more lonely than the eddystone lighthouse look at ita mere hillock and elbow of sand all beach without a background there is more sand there than you would use in twenty years as a substitute for blotting paper some gamesome wights will tell you that they have to plant weeds there they dont grow naturally that they import canada thistles that they have to send beyond seas for a spile to stop a leak in an oil cask that pieces of wood in nantucket are carried about like bits of the true cross in rome that people there plant toadstools before their houses to get under the shade in summer time that one blade of grass makes an oasis three blades in a days walk a prairie that they wear quicksand shoes something like laplander snowshoes that they are so shut up belted about every way inclosed surrounded and made an utter island of by the ocean that to their very chairs and tables small clams will sometimes be found adhering as to the backs of sea turtles but these extravaganzas only show that nantucket is no illinois ,MobyDick or The Whale
look now at the wondrous traditional story of how this island was settled by the redmen thus goes the legend in olden times an eagle swooped down upon the new england coast and carried off an infant indian in his talons with loud lament the parents saw their child borne out of sight over the wide waters they resolved to follow in the same direction setting out in their canoes after a perilous passage they discovered the island and there they found an empty ivory casketthe poor little indians skeleton ,MobyDick or The Whale
what wonder then that these nantucketers born on a beach should take to the sea for a livelihood they first caught crabs and quohogs in the sand grown bolder they waded out with nets for mackerel more experienced they pushed off in boats and captured cod and at last launching a navy of great ships on the sea explored this watery world put an incessant belt of circumnavigations round it peeped in at behrings straits and in all seasons and all oceans declared everlasting war with the mightiest animated mass that has survived the flood most monstrous and most mountainous that himmalehan saltsea mastodon clothed with such portentousness of unconscious power that his very panics are more to be dreaded than his most fearless and malicious assaults ,MobyDick or The Whale
and thus have these naked nantucketers these sea hermits issuing from their anthill in the sea overrun and conquered the watery world like so many alexanders parcelling out among them the atlantic pacific and indian oceans as the three pirate powers did poland let america add mexico to texas and pile cuba upon canada let the english overswarm all india and hang out their blazing banner from the sun two thirds of this terraqueous globe are the nantucketers for the sea is his he owns it as emperors own empires other seamen having but a right of way through it merchant ships are but extension bridges armed ones but floating forts even pirates and privateers though following the sea as highwaymen the road they but plunder other ships other fragments of the land like themselves without seeking to draw their living from the bottomless deep itself the nantucketer he alone resides and riots on the sea he alone in bible language goes down to it in ships to and fro ploughing it as his own special plantation there is his home there lies his business which a noahs flood would not interrupt though it overwhelmed all the millions in china he lives on the sea as prairie cocks in the prairie he hides among the waves he climbs them as chamois hunters climb the alps for years he knows not the land so that when he comes to it at last it smells like another world more strangely than the moon would to an earthsman with the landless gull that at sunset folds her wings and is rocked to sleep between billows so at nightfall the nantucketer out of sight of land furls his sails and lays him to his rest while under his very pillow rush herds of walruses and whales ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was quite late in the evening when the little moss came snugly to anchor and queequeg and i went ashore so we could attend to no business that day at least none but a supper and a bed the landlord of the spouterinn had recommended us to his cousin hosea hussey of the try pots whom he asserted to be the proprietor of one of the best kept hotels in all nantucket and moreover he had assured us that cousin hosea as he called him was famous for his chowders in short he plainly hinted that we could not possibly do better than try potluck at the try pots but the directions he had given us about keeping a yellow warehouse on our starboard hand till we opened a white church to the larboard and then keeping that on the larboard hand till we made a corner three points to the starboard and that done then ask the first man we met where the place was these crooked directions of his very much puzzled us at first especially as at the outset queequeg insisted that the yellow warehouseour first point of departuremust be left on the larboard hand whereas i had understood peter coffin to say it was on the starboard however by dint of beating about a little in the dark and now and then knocking up a peaceable inhabitant to inquire the way we at last came to something which there was no mistaking ,MobyDick or The Whale
two enormous wooden pots painted black and suspended by asses ears swung from the crosstrees of an old topmast planted in front of an old doorway the horns of the crosstrees were sawed off on the other side so that this old topmast looked not a little like a gallows perhaps i was over sensitive to such impressions at the time but i could not help staring at this gallows with a vague misgiving a sort of crick was in my neck as i gazed up to the two remaining horns yes two of them one for queequeg and one for me its ominous thinks i a coffin my innkeeper upon landing in my first whaling port tombstones staring at me in the whalemens chapel and here a gallows and a pair of prodigious black pots too are these last throwing out oblique hints touching tophet ,MobyDick or The Whale
i was called from these reflections by the sight of a freckled woman with yellow hair and a yellow gown standing in the porch of the inn under a dull red lamp swinging there that looked much like an injured eye and carrying on a brisk scolding with a man in a purple woollen shirt ,MobyDick or The Whale
and so it turned out mr hosea hussey being from home but leaving mrs hussey entirely competent to attend to all his affairs upon making known our desires for a supper and a bed mrs hussey postponing further scolding for the present ushered us into a little room and seating us at a table spread with the relics of a recently concluded repast turned round to us and saidclam or cod ,MobyDick or The Whale
but being in a great hurry to resume scolding the man in the purple shirt who was waiting for it in the entry and seeming to hear nothing but the word clam mrs hussey hurried towards an open door leading to the kitchen and bawling out clam for two disappeared ,MobyDick or The Whale
however a warm savory steam from the kitchen served to belie the apparently cheerless prospect before us but when that smoking chowder came in the mystery was delightfully explained oh sweet friends hearken to me it was made of small juicy clams scarcely bigger than hazel nuts mixed with pounded ship biscuit and salted pork cut up into little flakes the whole enriched with butter and plentifully seasoned with pepper and salt our appetites being sharpened by the frosty voyage and in particular queequeg seeing his favourite fishing food before him and the chowder being surpassingly excellent we despatched it with great expedition when leaning back a moment and bethinking me of mrs husseys clam and cod announcement i thought i would try a little experiment stepping to the kitchen door i uttered the word cod with great emphasis and resumed my seat in a few moments the savoury steam came forth again but with a different flavor and in good time a fine codchowder was placed before us ,MobyDick or The Whale
we resumed business and while plying our spoons in the bowl thinks i to myself i wonder now if this here has any effect on the head whats that stultifying saying about chowderheaded people but look queequeg aint that a live eel in your bowl wheres your harpoon ,MobyDick or The Whale
fishiest of all fishy places was the try pots which well deserved its name for the pots there were always boiling chowders chowder for breakfast and chowder for dinner and chowder for supper till you began to look for fishbones coming through your clothes the area before the house was paved with clamshells mrs hussey wore a polished necklace of codfish vertebra and hosea hussey had his account books bound in superior old sharkskin there was a fishy flavor to the milk too which i could not at all account for till one morning happening to take a stroll along the beach among some fishermens boats i saw hoseas brindled cow feeding on fish remnants and marching along the sand with each foot in a cods decapitated head looking very slipshod i assure ye ,MobyDick or The Whale
supper concluded we received a lamp and directions from mrs hussey concerning the nearest way to bed but as queequeg was about to precede me up the stairs the lady reached forth her arm and demanded his harpoon she allowed no harpoon in her chambers why not said i every true whaleman sleeps with his harpoonbut why not because its dangerous says she ever since young stiggs coming from that unfortnt vyge of his when he was gone four years and a half with only three barrels of ile was found dead in my first floor back with his harpoon in his side ever since then i allow no boarders to take sich dangerous weepons in their rooms at night so mr queequeg for she had learned his name i will just take this here iron and keep it for you till morning but the chowder clam or cod tomorrow for breakfast men ,MobyDick or The Whale
in bed we concocted our plans for the morrow but to my surprise and no small concern queequeg now gave me to understand that he had been diligently consulting yojothe name of his black little godand yojo had told him two or three times over and strongly insisted upon it everyway that instead of our going together among the whalingfleet in harbor and in concert selecting our craft instead of this i say yojo earnestly enjoined that the selection of the ship should rest wholly with me inasmuch as yojo purposed befriending us and in order to do so had already pitched upon a vessel which if left to myself i ishmael should infallibly light upon for all the world as though it had turned out by chance and in that vessel i must immediately ship myself for the present irrespective of queequeg ,MobyDick or The Whale
i have forgotten to mention that in many things queequeg placed great confidence in the excellence of yojos judgment and surprising forecast of things and cherished yojo with considerable esteem as a rather good sort of god who perhaps meant well enough upon the whole but in all cases did not succeed in his benevolent designs ,MobyDick or The Whale
now this plan of queequegs or rather yojos touching the selection of our craft i did not like that plan at all i had not a little relied upon queequegs sagacity to point out the whaler best fitted to carry us and our fortunes securely but as all my remonstrances produced no effect upon queequeg i was obliged to acquiesce and accordingly prepared to set about this business with a determined rushing sort of energy and vigor that should quickly settle that trifling little affair next morning early leaving queequeg shut up with yojo in our little bedroomfor it seemed that it was some sort of lent or ramadan or day of fasting humiliation and prayer with queequeg and yojo that day how it was i never could find out for though i applied myself to it several times i never could master his liturgies and xxxix articlesleaving queequeg then fasting on his tomahawk pipe and yojo warming himself at his sacrificial fire of shavings i sallied out among the shipping after much prolonged sauntering and many random inquiries i learnt that there were three ships up for threeyears voyagesthe devildam the titbit and the pequod devildam i do not know the origin of titbit is obvious pequod you will no doubt remember was the name of a celebrated tribe of massachusetts indians now extinct as the ancient medes i peered and pryed about the devildam from her hopped over to the titbit and finally going on board the pequod looked around her for a moment and then decided that this was the very ship for us ,MobyDick or The Whale
you may have seen many a quaint craft in your day for aught i knowsquaretoed luggers mountainous japanese junks butterbox galliots and what not but take my word for it you never saw such a rare old craft as this same rare old pequod she was a ship of the old school rather small if anything with an oldfashioned clawfooted look about her long seasoned and weatherstained in the typhoons and calms of all four oceans her old hulls complexion was darkened like a french grenadiers who has alike fought in egypt and siberia her venerable bows looked bearded her mastscut somewhere on the coast of japan where her original ones were lost overboard in a galeher masts stood stiffly up like the spines of the three old kings of cologne her ancient decks were worn and wrinkled like the pilgrimworshipped flagstone in canterbury cathedral where becket bled but to all these her old antiquities were added new and marvellous features pertaining to the wild business that for more than half a century she had followed old captain peleg many years her chiefmate before he commanded another vessel of his own and now a retired seaman and one of the principal owners of the pequodthis old peleg during the term of his chiefmateship had built upon her original grotesqueness and inlaid it all over with a quaintness both of material and device unmatched by anything except it be thorkillhakes carved buckler or bedstead she was apparelled like any barbaric ethiopian emperor his neck heavy with pendants of polished ivory she was a thing of trophies a cannibal of a craft tricking herself forth in the chased bones of her enemies all round her unpanelled open bulwarks were garnished like one continuous jaw with the long sharp teeth of the sperm whale inserted there for pins to fasten her old hempen thews and tendons to those thews ran not through base blocks of land wood but deftly travelled over sheaves of seaivory scorning a turnstile wheel at her reverend helm she sported there a tiller and that tiller was in one mass curiously carved from the long narrow lower jaw of her hereditary foe the helmsman who steered by that tiller in a tempest felt like the tartar when he holds back his fiery steed by clutching its jaw a noble craft but somehow a most melancholy all noble things are touched with that ,MobyDick or The Whale
now when i looked about the quarterdeck for some one having authority in order to propose myself as a candidate for the voyage at first i saw nobody but i could not well overlook a strange sort of tent or rather wigwam pitched a little behind the mainmast it seemed only a temporary erection used in port it was of a conical shape some ten feet high consisting of the long huge slabs of limber black bone taken from the middle and highest part of the jaws of the rightwhale planted with their broad ends on the deck a circle of these slabs laced together mutually sloped towards each other and at the apex united in a tufted point where the loose hairy fibres waved to and fro like the topknot on some old pottowottamie sachems head a triangular opening faced towards the bows of the ship so that the insider commanded a complete view forward ,MobyDick or The Whale
and half concealed in this queer tenement i at length found one who by his aspect seemed to have authority and who it being noon and the ships work suspended was now enjoying respite from the burden of command he was seated on an oldfashioned oaken chair wriggling all over with curious carving and the bottom of which was formed of a stout interlacing of the same elastic stuff of which the wigwam was constructed ,MobyDick or The Whale
there was nothing so very particular perhaps about the appearance of the elderly man i saw he was brown and brawny like most old seamen and heavily rolled up in blue pilotcloth cut in the quaker style only there was a fine and almost microscopic network of the minutest wrinkles interlacing round his eyes which must have arisen from his continual sailings in many hard gales and always looking to windwardfor this causes the muscles about the eyes to become pursed together such eyewrinkles are very effectual in a scowl ,MobyDick or The Whale
merchant service be damned talk not that lingo to me dost see that legill take that leg away from thy stern if ever thou talkest of the marchant service to me again marchant service indeed i suppose now ye feel considerable proud of having served in those marchant ships but flukes man what makes thee want to go a whaling ehit looks a little suspicious dont it ehhast not been a pirate hast thoudidst not rob thy last captain didst thoudost not think of murdering the officers when thou gettest to sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
i protested my innocence of these things i saw that under the mask of these half humorous innuendoes this old seaman as an insulated quakerish nantucketer was full of his insular prejudices and rather distrustful of all aliens unless they hailed from cape cod or the vineyard ,MobyDick or The Whale
thou art speaking to captain pelegthats who ye are speaking to young man it belongs to me and captain bildad to see the pequod fitted out for the voyage and supplied with all her needs including crew we are part owners and agents but as i was going to say if thou wantest to know what whaling is as thou tellest ye do i can put ye in a way of finding it out before ye bind yourself to it past backing out clap eye on captain ahab young man and thou wilt find that he has only one leg ,MobyDick or The Whale
i was a little alarmed by his energy perhaps also a little touched at the hearty grief in his concluding exclamation but said as calmly as i could what you say is no doubt true enough sir but how could i know there was any peculiar ferocity in that particular whale though indeed i might have inferred as much from the simple fact of the accident ,MobyDick or The Whale
hard down out of that mind what i said about the marchant servicedont aggravate mei wont have it but let us understand each other i have given thee a hint about what whaling is do ye yet feel inclined for it ,MobyDick or The Whale
good again now then thou not only wantest to go awhaling to find out by experience what whaling is but ye also want to go in order to see the world was not that what ye said i thought so well then just step forward there and take a peep over the weatherbow and then back to me and tell me what ye see there ,MobyDick or The Whale
for a moment i stood a little puzzled by this curious request not knowing exactly how to take it whether humorously or in earnest but concentrating all his crows feet into one scowl captain peleg started me on the errand ,MobyDick or The Whale
going forward and glancing over the weather bow i perceived that the ship swinging to her anchor with the floodtide was now obliquely pointing towards the open ocean the prospect was unlimited but exceedingly monotonous and forbidding not the slightest variety that i could see ,MobyDick or The Whale
i was a little staggered but go awhaling i must and i would and the pequod was as good a ship as anyi thought the bestand all this i now repeated to peleg seeing me so determined he expressed his willingness to ship me ,MobyDick or The Whale
seated on the transom was what seemed to me a most uncommon and surprising figure it turned out to be captain bildad who along with captain peleg was one of the largest owners of the vessel the other shares as is sometimes the case in these ports being held by a crowd of old annuitants widows fatherless children and chancery wards each owning about the value of a timber head or a foot of plank or a nail or two in the ship people in nantucket invest their money in whaling vessels the same way that you do yours in approved state stocks bringing in good interest ,MobyDick or The Whale
now bildad like peleg and indeed many other nantucketers was a quaker the island having been originally settled by that sect and to this day its inhabitants in general retain in an uncommon measure the peculiarities of the quaker only variously and anomalously modified by things altogether alien and heterogeneous for some of these same quakers are the most sanguinary of all sailors and whalehunters they are fighting quakers they are quakers with a vengeance ,MobyDick or The Whale
so that there are instances among them of men who named with scripture namesa singularly common fashion on the islandand in childhood naturally imbibing the stately dramatic thee and thou of the quaker idiom still from the audacious daring and boundless adventure of their subsequent lives strangely blend with these unoutgrown peculiarities a thousand bold dashes of character not unworthy a scandinavian seaking or a poetical pagan roman and when these things unite in a man of greatly superior natural force with a globular brain and a ponderous heart who has also by the stillness and seclusion of many long nightwatches in the remotest waters and beneath constellations never seen here at the north been led to think untraditionally and independently receiving all natures sweet or savage impressions fresh from her own virgin voluntary and confiding breast and thereby chiefly but with some help from accidental advantages to learn a bold and nervous lofty languagethat man makes one in a whole nations censusa mighty pageant creature formed for noble tragedies nor will it at all detract from him dramatically regarded if either by birth or other circumstances he have what seems a half wilful overruling morbidness at the bottom of his nature for all men tragically great are made so through a certain morbidness be sure of this o young ambition all mortal greatness is but disease but as yet we have not to do with such an one but with quite another and still a man who if indeed peculiar it only results again from another phase of the quaker modified by individual circumstances ,MobyDick or The Whale
like captain peleg captain bildad was a welltodo retired whaleman but unlike captain pelegwho cared not a rush for what are called serious things and indeed deemed those selfsame serious things the veriest of all triflescaptain bildad had not only been originally educated according to the strictest sect of nantucket quakerism but all his subsequent ocean life and the sight of many unclad lovely island creatures round the hornall that had not moved this native born quaker one single jot had not so much as altered one angle of his vest still for all this immutableness was there some lack of common consistency about worthy captain bildad though refusing from conscientious scruples to bear arms against land invaders yet himself had illimitably invaded the atlantic and pacific and though a sworn foe to human bloodshed yet had he in his straightbodied coat spilled tuns upon tuns of leviathan gore how now in the contemplative evening of his days the pious bildad reconciled these things in the reminiscence i do not know but it did not seem to concern him much and very probably he had long since come to the sage and sensible conclusion that a mans religion is one thing and this practical world quite another this world pays dividends rising from a little cabinboy in short clothes of the drabbest drab to a harpooneer in a broad shadbellied waistcoat from that becoming boatheader chiefmate and captain and finally a ship owner bildad as i hinted before had concluded his adventurous career by wholly retiring from active life at the goodly age of sixty and dedicating his remaining days to the quiet receiving of his wellearned income ,MobyDick or The Whale
now bildad i am sorry to say had the reputation of being an incorrigible old hunks and in his seagoing days a bitter hard taskmaster they told me in nantucket though it certainly seems a curious story that when he sailed the old categut whaleman his crew upon arriving home were mostly all carried ashore to the hospital sore exhausted and worn out for a pious man especially for a quaker he was certainly rather hardhearted to say the least he never used to swear though at his men they said but somehow he got an inordinate quantity of cruel unmitigated hard work out of them when bildad was a chiefmate to have his drabcoloured eye intently looking at you made you feel completely nervous till you could clutch somethinga hammer or a marlingspike and go to work like mad at something or other never mind what indolence and idleness perished before him his own person was the exact embodiment of his utilitarian character on his long gaunt body he carried no spare flesh no superfluous beard his chin having a soft economical nap to it like the worn nap of his broadbrimmed hat ,MobyDick or The Whale
such then was the person that i saw seated on the transom when i followed captain peleg down into the cabin the space between the decks was small and there boltupright sat old bildad who always sat so and never leaned and this to save his coat tails his broadbrim was placed beside him his legs were stiffly crossed his drab vesture was buttoned up to his chin and spectacles on nose he seemed absorbed in reading from a ponderous volume ,MobyDick or The Whale
i thought him the queerest old quaker i ever saw especially as peleg his friend and old shipmate seemed such a blusterer but i said nothing only looking round me sharply peleg now threw open a chest and drawing forth the ships articles placed pen and ink before him and seated himself at a little table i began to think it was high time to settle with myself at what terms i would be willing to engage for the voyage i was already aware that in the whaling business they paid no wages but all hands including the captain received certain shares of the profits called lays and that these lays were proportioned to the degree of importance pertaining to the respective duties of the ships company i was also aware that being a green hand at whaling my own lay would not be very large but considering that i was used to the sea could steer a ship splice a rope and all that i made no doubt that from all i had heard i should be offered at least the th laythat is the th part of the clear net proceeds of the voyage whatever that might eventually amount to and though the th lay was what they call a rather long lay yet it was better than nothing and if we had a lucky voyage might pretty nearly pay for the clothing i would wear out on it not to speak of my three years beef and board for which i would not have to pay one stiver ,MobyDick or The Whale
it might be thought that this was a poor way to accumulate a princely fortuneand so it was a very poor way indeed but i am one of those that never take on about princely fortunes and am quite content if the world is ready to board and lodge me while i am putting up at this grim sign of the thunder cloud upon the whole i thought that the th lay would be about the fair thing but would not have been surprised had i been offered the th considering i was of a broadshouldered make ,MobyDick or The Whale
but one thing nevertheless that made me a little distrustful about receiving a generous share of the profits was this ashore i had heard something of both captain peleg and his unaccountable old crony bildad how that they being the principal proprietors of the pequod therefore the other and more inconsiderable and scattered owners left nearly the whole management of the ships affairs to these two and i did not know but what the stingy old bildad might have a mighty deal to say about shipping hands especially as i now found him on board the pequod quite at home there in the cabin and reading his bible as if at his own fireside now while peleg was vainly trying to mend a pen with his jackknife old bildad to my no small surprise considering that he was such an interested party in these proceedings bildad never heeded us but went on mumbling to himself out of his book lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth where moth ,MobyDick or The Whale
lay indeed thought i and such a lay the seven hundred and seventyseventh well old bildad you are determined that i for one shall not lay up many lays here below where moth and rust do corrupt it was an exceedingly long lay that indeed and though from the magnitude of the figure it might at first deceive a landsman yet the slightest consideration will show that though seven hundred and seventyseven is a pretty large number yet when you come to make a teenth of it you will then see i say that the seven hundred and seventyseventh part of a farthing is a good deal less than seven hundred and seventyseven gold doubloons and so i thought at the time ,MobyDick or The Whale
bildad laid down his book and turning solemnly towards him said captain peleg thou hast a generous heart but thou must consider the duty thou owest to the other owners of this shipwidows and orphans many of themand that if we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man we may be taking the bread from those widows and those orphans the seven hundred and seventyseventh lay captain peleg ,MobyDick or The Whale
thou bildad roared peleg starting up and clattering about the cabin blast ye captain bildad if i had followed thy advice in these matters i would afore now had a conscience to lug about that would be heavy enough to founder the largest ship that ever sailed round cape horn ,MobyDick or The Whale
captain peleg said bildad steadily thy conscience may be drawing ten inches of water or ten fathoms i cant tell but as thou art still an impenitent man captain peleg i greatly fear lest thy conscience be but a leaky one and will in the end sink thee foundering down to the fiery pit captain peleg ,MobyDick or The Whale
fiery pit fiery pit ye insult me man past all natural bearing ye insult me its an allfired outrage to tell any human creature that hes bound to hell flukes and flames bildad say that again to me and start my soulbolts but illillyes ill swallow a live goat with all his hair and horns on out of the cabin ye canting drabcoloured son of a wooden guna straight wake with ye ,MobyDick or The Whale
alarmed at this terrible outburst between the two principal and responsible owners of the ship and feeling half a mind to give up all idea of sailing in a vessel so questionably owned and temporarily commanded i stepped aside from the door to give egress to bildad who i made no doubt was all eagerness to vanish from before the awakened wrath of peleg but to my astonishment he sat down again on the transom very quietly and seemed to have not the slightest intention of withdrawing he seemed quite used to impenitent peleg and his ways as for peleg after letting off his rage as he had there seemed no more left in him and he too sat down like a lamb though he twitched a little as if still nervously agitated whew he whistled at lastthe squalls gone off to leeward i think bildad thou used to be good at sharpening a lance mend that pen will ye my jackknife here needs the grindstone thats he thank ye bildad now then my young man ishmaels thy name didnt ye say well then down ye go here ishmael for the three hundredth lay ,MobyDick or The Whale
but i had not proceeded far when i began to bethink me that the captain with whom i was to sail yet remained unseen by me though indeed in many cases a whaleship will be completely fitted out and receive all her crew on board ere the captain makes himself visible by arriving to take command for sometimes these voyages are so prolonged and the shore intervals at home so exceedingly brief that if the captain have a family or any absorbing concernment of that sort he does not trouble himself much about his ship in port but leaves her to the owners till all is ready for sea however it is always as well to have a look at him before irrevocably committing yourself into his hands turning back i accosted captain peleg inquiring where captain ahab was to be found ,MobyDick or The Whale
but i dont think thou wilt be able to at present i dont know exactly whats the matter with him but he keeps close inside the house a sort of sick and yet he dont look so in fact he aint sick but no he isnt well either any how young man he wont always see me so i dont suppose he will thee hes a queer man captain ahabso some thinkbut a good one oh thoult like him well enough no fear no fear hes a grand ungodly godlike man captain ahab doesnt speak much but when he does speak then you may well listen mark ye be forewarned ahabs above the common ahabs been in colleges as well as mong the cannibals been used to deeper wonders than the waves fixed his fiery lance in mightier stranger foes than whales his lance aye the keenest and the surest that out of all our isle oh he aint captain bildad no and he aint captain peleg hes ahab boy and ahab of old thou knowest was a crowned king ,MobyDick or The Whale
come hither to mehither hither said peleg with a significance in his eye that almost startled me look ye lad never say that on board the pequod never say it anywhere captain ahab did not name himself twas a foolish ignorant whim of his crazy widowed mother who died when he was only a twelvemonth old and yet the old squaw tistig at gayhead said that the name would somehow prove prophetic and perhaps other fools like her may tell thee the same i wish to warn thee its a lie i know captain ahab well ive sailed with him as mate years ago i know what he isa good mannot a pious good man like bildad but a swearing good mansomething like meonly theres a good deal more of him aye aye i know that he was never very jolly and i know that on the passage home he was a little out of his mind for a spell but it was the sharp shooting pains in his bleeding stump that brought that about as any one might see i know too that ever since he lost his leg last voyage by that accursed whale hes been a kind of moodydesperate moody and savage sometimes but that will all pass off and once for all let me tell thee and assure thee young man its better to sail with a moody good captain than a laughing bad one so goodbye to theeand wrong not captain ahab because he happens to have a wicked name besides my boy he has a wifenot three voyages weddeda sweet resigned girl think of that by that sweet girl that old man has a child hold ye then there can be any utter hopeless harm in ahab no no my lad stricken blasted if he be ahab has his humanities ,MobyDick or The Whale
as i walked away i was full of thoughtfulness what had been incidentally revealed to me of captain ahab filled me with a certain wild vagueness of painfulness concerning him and somehow at the time i felt a sympathy and a sorrow for him but for i dont know what unless it was the cruel loss of his leg and yet i also felt a strange awe of him but that sort of awe which i cannot at all describe was not exactly awe i do not know what it was but i felt it and it did not disincline me towards him though i felt impatience at what seemed like mystery in him so imperfectly as he was known to me then however my thoughts were at length carried in other directions so that for the present dark ahab slipped my mind ,MobyDick or The Whale
as queequegs ramadan or fasting and humiliation was to continue all day i did not choose to disturb him till towards nightfall for i cherish the greatest respect towards everybodys religious obligations never mind how comical and could not find it in my heart to undervalue even a congregation of ants worshipping a toadstool or those other creatures in certain parts of our earth who with a degree of footmanism quite unprecedented in other planets bow down before the torso of a deceased landed proprietor merely on account of the inordinate possessions yet owned and rented in his name ,MobyDick or The Whale
i say we good presbyterian christians should be charitable in these things and not fancy ourselves so vastly superior to other mortals pagans and what not because of their halfcrazy conceits on these subjects there was queequeg now certainly entertaining the most absurd notions about yojo and his ramadanbut what of that queequeg thought he knew what he was about i suppose he seemed to be content and there let him rest all our arguing with him would not avail let him be i say and heaven have mercy on us allpresbyterians and pagans alikefor we are all somehow dreadfully cracked about the head and sadly need mending ,MobyDick or The Whale
towards evening when i felt assured that all his performances and rituals must be over i went up to his room and knocked at the door but no answer i tried to open it but it was fastened inside queequeg said i softly through the keyholeall silent i say queequeg why dont you speak its iishmael but all remained still as before i began to grow alarmed i had allowed him such abundant time i thought he might have had an apoplectic fit i looked through the keyhole but the door opening into an odd corner of the room the keyhole prospect was but a crooked and sinister one i could only see part of the footboard of the bed and a line of the wall but nothing more i was surprised to behold resting against the wall the wooden shaft of queequegs harpoon which the landlady the evening previous had taken from him before our mounting to the chamber thats strange thought i but at any rate since the harpoon stands yonder and he seldom or never goes abroad without it therefore he must be inside here and no possible mistake ,MobyDick or The Whale
queequegqueequegall still something must have happened apoplexy i tried to burst open the door but it stubbornly resisted running down stairs i quickly stated my suspicions to the first person i metthe chambermaid la la she cried i thought something must be the matter i went to make the bed after breakfast and the door was locked and not a mouse to be heard and its been just so silent ever since but i thought may be you had both gone off and locked your baggage in for safe keeping la la maammistress murder mrs hussey apoplexyand with these cries she ran towards the kitchen i following ,MobyDick or The Whale
mrs hussey soon appeared with a mustardpot in one hand and a vinegarcruet in the other having just broken away from the occupation of attending to the castors and scolding her little black boy meantime ,MobyDick or The Whale
woodhouse cried i which way to it run for gods sake and fetch something to pry open the doorthe axethe axe hes had a stroke depend upon itand so saying i was unmethodically rushing up stairs again emptyhanded when mrs hussey interposed the mustardpot and vinegarcruet and the entire castor of her countenance ,MobyDick or The Whale
look here said the landlady quickly putting down the vinegarcruet so as to have one hand free look here are you talking about prying open any of my doorsand with that she seized my arm whats the matter with you whats the matter with you shipmate ,MobyDick or The Whale
in as calm but rapid a manner as possible i gave her to understand the whole case unconsciously clapping the vinegarcruet to one side of her nose she ruminated for an instant then exclaimedno i havent seen it since i put it there running to a little closet under the landing of the stairs she glanced in and returning told me that queequegs harpoon was missing hes killed himself she cried its unfortnate stiggs done over againthere goes another counterpanegod pity his poor motherit will be the ruin of my house has the poor lad a sister wheres that girlthere betty go to snarles the painter and tell him to paint me a sign withno suicides permitted here and no smoking in the parlormight as well kill both birds at once kill the lord be merciful to his ghost whats that noise there you young man avast there ,MobyDick or The Whale
i dont allow it i wont have my premises spoiled go for the locksmith theres one about a mile from here but avast putting her hand in her sidepocket heres a key thatll fit i guess lets see and with that she turned it in the lock but alas queequegs supplemental bolt remained unwithdrawn within ,MobyDick or The Whale
have to burst it open said i and was running down the entry a little for a good start when the landlady caught at me again vowing i should not break down her premises but i tore from her and with a sudden bodily rush dashed myself full against the mark ,MobyDick or The Whale
with a prodigious noise the door flew open and the knob slamming against the wall sent the plaster to the ceiling and there good heavens there sat queequeg altogether cool and selfcollected right in the middle of the room squatting on his hams and holding yojo on top of his head he looked neither one way nor the other way but sat like a carved image with scarce a sign of active life ,MobyDick or The Whale
but all we said not a word could we drag out of him i almost felt like pushing him over so as to change his position for it was almost intolerable it seemed so painfully and unnaturally constrained especially as in all probability he had been sitting so for upwards of eight or ten hours going too without his regular meals ,MobyDick or The Whale
closing the door upon the landlady i endeavored to prevail upon queequeg to take a chair but in vain there he sat and all he could dofor all my polite arts and blandishmentshe would not move a peg nor say a single word nor even look at me nor notice my presence in the slightest way ,MobyDick or The Whale
i wonder thought i if this can possibly be a part of his ramadan do they fast on their hams that way in his native island it must be so yes its part of his creed i suppose well then let him rest hell get up sooner or later no doubt it cant last for ever thank god and his ramadan only comes once a year and i dont believe its very punctual then ,MobyDick or The Whale
i went down to supper after sitting a long time listening to the long stories of some sailors who had just come from a plumpudding voyage as they called it that is a short whalingvoyage in a schooner or brig confined to the north of the line in the atlantic ocean only after listening to these plumpuddingers till nearly eleven oclock i went up stairs to go to bed feeling quite sure by this time queequeg must certainly have brought his ramadan to a termination but no there he was just where i had left him he had not stirred an inch i began to grow vexed with him it seemed so downright senseless and insane to be sitting there all day and half the night on his hams in a cold room holding a piece of wood on his head ,MobyDick or The Whale
despairing of him therefore i determined to go to bed and to sleep and no doubt before a great while he would follow me but previous to turning in i took my heavy bearskin jacket and threw it over him as it promised to be a very cold night and he had nothing but his ordinary round jacket on for some time do all i would i could not get into the faintest doze i had blown out the candle and the mere thought of queequegnot four feet offsitting there in that uneasy position stark alone in the cold and dark this made me really wretched think of it sleeping all night in the same room with a wide awake pagan on his hams in this dreary unaccountable ramadan ,MobyDick or The Whale
but somehow i dropped off at last and knew nothing more till break of day when looking over the bedside there squatted queequeg as if he had been screwed down to the floor but as soon as the first glimpse of sun entered the window up he got with stiff and grating joints but with a cheerful look limped towards me where i lay pressed his forehead again against mine and said his ramadan was over ,MobyDick or The Whale
now as i before hinted i have no objection to any persons religion be it what it may so long as that person does not kill or insult any other person because that other person dont believe it also but when a mans religion becomes really frantic when it is a positive torment to him and in fine makes this earth of ours an uncomfortable inn to lodge in then i think it high time to take that individual aside and argue the point with him ,MobyDick or The Whale
and just so i now did with queequeg queequeg said i get into bed now and lie and listen to me i then went on beginning with the rise and progress of the primitive religions and coming down to the various religions of the present time during which time i labored to show queequeg that all these lents ramadans and prolonged hamsquattings in cold cheerless rooms were stark nonsense bad for the health useless for the soul opposed in short to the obvious laws of hygiene and common sense i told him too that he being in other things such an extremely sensible and sagacious savage it pained me very badly pained me to see him now so deplorably foolish about this ridiculous ramadan of his besides argued i fasting makes the body cave in hence the spirit caves in and all thoughts born of a fast must necessarily be halfstarved this is the reason why most dyspeptic religionists cherish such melancholy notions about their hereafters in one word queequeg said i rather digressively hell is an idea first born on an undigested appledumpling and since then perpetuated through the hereditary dyspepsias nurtured by ramadans ,MobyDick or The Whale
i then asked queequeg whether he himself was ever troubled with dyspepsia expressing the idea very plainly so that he could take it in he said no only upon one memorable occasion it was after a great feast given by his father the king on the gaining of a great battle wherein fifty of the enemy had been killed by about two oclock in the afternoon and all cooked and eaten that very evening ,MobyDick or The Whale
no more queequeg said i shuddering that will do for i knew the inferences without his further hinting them i had seen a sailor who had visited that very island and he told me that it was the custom when a great battle had been gained there to barbecue all the slain in the yard or garden of the victor and then one by one they were placed in great wooden trenchers and garnished round like a pilau with breadfruit and cocoanuts and with some parsley in their mouths were sent round with the victors compliments to all his friends just as though these presents were so many christmas turkeys ,MobyDick or The Whale
after all i do not think that my remarks about religion made much impression upon queequeg because in the first place he somehow seemed dull of hearing on that important subject unless considered from his own point of view and in the second place he did not more than one third understand me couch my ideas simply as i would and finally he no doubt thought he knew a good deal more about the true religion than i did he looked at me with a sort of condescending concern and compassion as though he thought it a great pity that such a sensible young man should be so hopelessly lost to evangelical pagan piety ,MobyDick or The Whale
at last we rose and dressed and queequeg taking a prodigiously hearty breakfast of chowders of all sorts so that the landlady should not make much profit by reason of his ramadan we sallied out to board the pequod sauntering along and picking our teeth with halibut bones ,MobyDick or The Whale
as we were walking down the end of the wharf towards the ship queequeg carrying his harpoon captain peleg in his gruff voice loudly hailed us from his wigwam saying he had not suspected my friend was a cannibal and furthermore announcing that he let no cannibals on board that craft unless they previously produced their papers ,MobyDick or The Whale
yes said captain bildad in his hollow voice sticking his head from behind pelegs out of the wigwam he must show that hes converted son of darkness he added turning to queequeg art thou at present in communion with any christian church ,MobyDick or The Whale
first congregational church cried bildad what that worships in deacon deuteronomy colemans meetinghouse and so saying taking out his spectacles he rubbed them with his great yellow bandana handkerchief and putting them on very carefully came out of the wigwam and leaning stiffly over the bulwarks took a good long look at queequeg ,MobyDick or The Whale
finding myself thus hard pushed i replied i mean sir the same ancient catholic church to which you and i and captain peleg there and queequeg here and all of us and every mothers son and soul of us belong the great and everlasting first congregation of this whole worshipping world we all belong to that only some of us cherish some queer crotchets no ways touching the grand belief in that we all join hands ,MobyDick or The Whale
splice thou meanst splice hands cried peleg drawing nearer young man youd better ship for a missionary instead of a foremast hand i never heard a better sermon deacon deuteronomywhy father mapple himself couldnt beat it and hes reckoned something come aboard come aboard never mind about the papers i say tell quohog therewhats that you call him tell quohog to step along by the great anchor what a harpoon hes got there looks like good stuff that and he handles it about right i say quohog or whatever your name is did you ever stand in the head of a whaleboat did you ever strike a fish ,MobyDick or The Whale
without saying a word queequeg in his wild sort of way jumped upon the bulwarks from thence into the bows of one of the whaleboats hanging to the side and then bracing his left knee and poising his harpoon cried out in some such way as this ,MobyDick or The Whale
capain you see him small drop tar on water dere you see him well spose him one whale eye well den and taking sharp aim at it he darted the iron right over old bildads broad brim clean across the ships decks and struck the glistening tar spot out of sight ,MobyDick or The Whale
quick bildad said peleg his partner who aghast at the close vicinity of the flying harpoon had retreated towards the cabin gangway quick i say you bildad and get the ships papers we must have hedgehog there i mean quohog in one of our boats look ye quohog well give ye the ninetieth lay and thats more than ever was given a harpooneer yet out of nantucket ,MobyDick or The Whale
when all preliminaries were over and peleg had got everything ready for signing he turned to me and said i guess quohog there dont know how to write does he i say quohog blast ye dost thou sign thy name or make thy mark ,MobyDick or The Whale
but at this question queequeg who had twice or thrice before taken part in similar ceremonies looked no ways abashed but taking the offered pen copied upon the paper in the proper place an exact counterpart of a queer round figure which was tattooed upon his arm so that through captain pelegs obstinate mistake touching his appellative it stood something like this ,MobyDick or The Whale
meanwhile captain bildad sat earnestly and steadfastly eyeing queequeg and at last rising solemnly and fumbling in the huge pockets of his broadskirted drab coat took out a bundle of tracts and selecting one entitled the latter day coming or no time to lose placed it in queequegs hands and then grasping them and the book with both his looked earnestly into his eyes and said son of darkness i must do my duty by thee i am part owner of this ship and feel concerned for the souls of all its crew if thou still clingest to thy pagan ways which i sadly fear i beseech thee remain not for aye a belial bondsman spurn the idol bell and the hideous dragon turn from the wrath to come mind thine eye i say oh goodness gracious steer clear of the fiery pit ,MobyDick or The Whale
avast there avast there bildad avast now spoiling our harpooneer cried peleg pious harpooneers never make good voyagersit takes the shark out of em no harpooneer is worth a straw who aint pretty sharkish there was young nat swaine once the bravest boatheader out of all nantucket and the vineyard he joined the meeting and never came to good he got so frightened about his plaguy soul that he shrinked and sheered away from whales for fear of afterclaps in case he got stove and went to davy jones ,MobyDick or The Whale
peleg peleg said bildad lifting his eyes and hands thou thyself as i myself hast seen many a perilous time thou knowest peleg what it is to have the fear of death how then canst thou prate in this ungodly guise thou beliest thine own heart peleg tell me when this same pequod here had her three masts overboard in that typhoon on japan that same voyage when thou went mate with captain ahab didst thou not think of death and the judgment then ,MobyDick or The Whale
hear him hear him now cried peleg marching across the cabin and thrusting his hands far down into his pocketshear him all of ye think of that when every moment we thought the ship would sink death and the judgment then what with all three masts making such an everlasting thundering against the side and every sea breaking over us fore and aft think of death and the judgment then no no time to think about death then life was what captain ahab and i was thinking of and how to save all handshow to rig jurymastshow to get into the nearest port that was what i was thinking of ,MobyDick or The Whale
bildad said no more but buttoning up his coat stalked on deck where we followed him there he stood very quietly overlooking some sailmakers who were mending a topsail in the waist now and then he stooped to pick up a patch or save an end of tarred twine which otherwise might have been wasted ,MobyDick or The Whale
queequeg and i had just left the pequod and were sauntering away from the water for the moment each occupied with his own thoughts when the above words were put to us by a stranger who pausing before us levelled his massive forefinger at the vessel in question he was but shabbily apparelled in faded jacket and patched trowsers a rag of a black handkerchief investing his neck a confluent smallpox had in all directions flowed over his face and left it like the complicated ribbed bed of a torrent when the rushing waters have been dried up ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh perhaps you havnt got any he said quickly no matter though i know many chaps that havnt got anygood luck to em and they are all the better off for it a souls a sort of a fifth wheel to a wagon ,MobyDick or The Whale
thats true thats trueyes both true enough but you must jump when he gives an order step and growl growl and gothats the word with captain ahab but nothing about that thing that happened to him off cape horn long ago when he lay like dead for three days and nights nothing about that deadly skrimmage with the spaniard afore the altar in santaheard nothing about that eh nothing about the silver calabash he spat into and nothing about his losing his leg last voyage according to the prophecy didnt ye hear a word about them matters and something more eh no i dont think ye did how could ye who knows it not all nantucket i guess but howsever mayhap yeve heard tell about the leg and how he lost it aye ye have heard of that i dare say oh yes that every one knows amosti mean they know hes only one leg and that a parmacetti took the other off ,MobyDick or The Whale
my friend said i what all this gibberish of yours is about i dont know and i dont much care for it seems to me that you must be a little damaged in the head but if you are speaking of captain ahab of that ship there the pequod then let me tell you that i know all about the loss of his leg ,MobyDick or The Whale
with finger pointed and eye levelled at the pequod the beggarlike stranger stood a moment as if in a troubled reverie then starting a little turned and saidyeve shipped have ye names down on the papers well well whats signed is signed and whats to be will be and then again perhaps it wont be after all anyhow its all fixed and arranged aready and some sailors or other must go with him i suppose as well these as any other men god pity em morning to ye shipmates morning the ineffable heavens bless ye im sorry i stopped ye ,MobyDick or The Whale
and its said very well and i like to hear a chap talk up that way you are just the man for himthe likes of ye morning to ye shipmates morning oh when ye get there tell em ive concluded not to make one of em ,MobyDick or The Whale
elijah thought i and we walked away both commenting after each others fashion upon this ragged old sailor and agreed that he was nothing but a humbug trying to be a bugbear but we had not gone perhaps above a hundred yards when chancing to turn a corner and looking back as i did so who should be seen but elijah following us though at a distance somehow the sight of him struck me so that i said nothing to queequeg of his being behind but passed on with my comrade anxious to see whether the stranger would turn the same corner that we did he did and then it seemed to me that he was dogging us but with what intent i could not for the life of me imagine this circumstance coupled with his ambiguous halfhinting halfrevealing shrouded sort of talk now begat in me all kinds of vague wonderments and halfapprehensions and all connected with the pequod and captain ahab and the leg he had lost and the cape horn fit and the silver calabash and what captain peleg had said of him when i left the ship the day previous and the prediction of the squaw tistig and the voyage we had bound ourselves to sail and a hundred other shadowy things ,MobyDick or The Whale
i was resolved to satisfy myself whether this ragged elijah was really dogging us or not and with that intent crossed the way with queequeg and on that side of it retraced our steps but elijah passed on without seeming to notice us this relieved me and once more and finally as it seemed to me i pronounced him in my heart a humbug ,MobyDick or The Whale
a day or two passed and there was great activity aboard the pequod not only were the old sails being mended but new sails were coming on board and bolts of canvas and coils of rigging in short everything betokened that the ships preparations were hurrying to a close captain peleg seldom or never went ashore but sat in his wigwam keeping a sharp lookout upon the hands bildad did all the purchasing and providing at the stores and the men employed in the hold and on the rigging were working till long after nightfall ,MobyDick or The Whale
on the day following queequegs signing the articles word was given at all the inns where the ships company were stopping that their chests must be on board before night for there was no telling how soon the vessel might be sailing so queequeg and i got down our traps resolving however to sleep ashore till the last but it seems they always give very long notice in these cases and the ship did not sail for several days but no wonder there was a good deal to be done and there is no telling how many things to be thought of before the pequod was fully equipped ,MobyDick or The Whale
every one knows what a multitude of thingsbeds saucepans knives and forks shovels and tongs napkins nutcrackers and what not are indispensable to the business of housekeeping just so with whaling which necessitates a threeyears housekeeping upon the wide ocean far from all grocers costermongers doctors bakers and bankers and though this also holds true of merchant vessels yet not by any means to the same extent as with whalemen for besides the great length of the whaling voyage the numerous articles peculiar to the prosecution of the fishery and the impossibility of replacing them at the remote harbors usually frequented it must be remembered that of all ships whaling vessels are the most exposed to accidents of all kinds and especially to the destruction and loss of the very things upon which the success of the voyage most depends hence the spare boats spare spars and spare lines and harpoons and spare everythings almost but a spare captain and duplicate ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
at the period of our arrival at the island the heaviest storage of the pequod had been almost completed comprising her beef bread water fuel and iron hoops and staves but as before hinted for some time there was a continual fetching and carrying on board of divers odds and ends of things both large and small ,MobyDick or The Whale
chief among those who did this fetching and carrying was captain bildads sister a lean old lady of a most determined and indefatigable spirit but withal very kindhearted who seemed resolved that if she could help it nothing should be found wanting in the pequod after once fairly getting to sea at one time she would come on board with a jar of pickles for the stewards pantry another time with a bunch of quills for the chief mates desk where he kept his log a third time with a roll of flannel for the small of some ones rheumatic back never did any woman better deserve her name which was charityaunt charity as everybody called her and like a sister of charity did this charitable aunt charity bustle about hither and thither ready to turn her hand and heart to anything that promised to yield safety comfort and consolation to all on board a ship in which her beloved brother bildad was concerned and in which she herself owned a score or two of wellsaved dollars ,MobyDick or The Whale
but it was startling to see this excellent hearted quakeress coming on board as she did the last day with a long oilladle in one hand and a still longer whaling lance in the other nor was bildad himself nor captain peleg at all backward as for bildad he carried about with him a long list of the articles needed and at every fresh arrival down went his mark opposite that article upon the paper every once in a while peleg came hobbling out of his whalebone den roaring at the men down the hatchways roaring up to the riggers at the masthead and then concluded by roaring back into his wigwam ,MobyDick or The Whale
during these days of preparation queequeg and i often visited the craft and as often i asked about captain ahab and how he was and when he was going to come on board his ship to these questions they would answer that he was getting better and better and was expected aboard every day meantime the two captains peleg and bildad could attend to everything necessary to fit the vessel for the voyage if i had been downright honest with myself i would have seen very plainly in my heart that i did but half fancy being committed this way to so long a voyage without once laying my eyes on the man who was to be the absolute dictator of it so soon as the ship sailed out upon the open sea but when a man suspects any wrong it sometimes happens that if he be already involved in the matter he insensibly strives to cover up his suspicions even from himself and much this way it was with me i said nothing and tried to think nothing ,MobyDick or The Whale
avast cried a voice whose owner at the same time coming close behind us laid a hand upon both our shoulders and then insinuating himself between us stood stooping forward a little in the uncertain twilight strangely peering from queequeg to me it was elijah ,MobyDick or The Whale
morning to ye morning to ye he rejoined again moving off oh i was going to warn ye againstbut never mind never mindits all one all in the family toosharp frost this morning aint it goodbye to ye shant see ye again very soon i guess unless its before the grand jury and with these cracked words he finally departed leaving me for the moment in no small wonderment at his frantic impudence ,MobyDick or The Whale
at last stepping on board the pequod we found everything in profound quiet not a soul moving the cabin entrance was locked within the hatches were all on and lumbered with coils of rigging going forward to the forecastle we found the slide of the scuttle open seeing a light we went down and found only an old rigger there wrapped in a tattered peajacket he was thrown at whole length upon two chests his face downwards and inclosed in his folded arms the profoundest slumber slept upon him ,MobyDick or The Whale
those sailors we saw queequeg where can they have gone to said i looking dubiously at the sleeper but it seemed that when on the wharf queequeg had not at all noticed what i now alluded to hence i would have thought myself to have been optically deceived in that matter were it not for elijahs otherwise inexplicable question but i beat the thing down and again marking the sleeper jocularly hinted to queequeg that perhaps we had best sit up with the body telling him to establish himself accordingly he put his hand upon the sleepers rear as though feeling if it was soft enough and then without more ado sat quietly down there ,MobyDick or The Whale
face said i call that his face very benevolent countenance then but how hard he breathes hes heaving himself get off queequeg you are heavy its grinding the face of the poor get off queequeg look hell twitch you off soon i wonder he dont wake ,MobyDick or The Whale
queequeg removed himself to just beyond the head of the sleeper and lighted his tomahawk pipe i sat at the feet we kept the pipe passing over the sleeper from one to the other meanwhile upon questioning him in his broken fashion queequeg gave me to understand that in his land owing to the absence of settees and sofas of all sorts the king chiefs and great people generally were in the custom of fattening some of the lower orders for ottomans and to furnish a house comfortably in that respect you had only to buy up eight or ten lazy fellows and lay them round in the piers and alcoves besides it was very convenient on an excursion much better than those gardenchairs which are convertible into walkingsticks upon occasion a chief calling his attendant and desiring him to make a settee of himself under a spreading tree perhaps in some damp marshy place ,MobyDick or The Whale
he was going on with some wild reminiscences about his tomahawkpipe which it seemed had in its two uses both brained his foes and soothed his soul when we were directly attracted to the sleeping rigger the strong vapor now completely filling the contracted hole it began to tell upon him he breathed with a sort of muffledness then seemed troubled in the nose then revolved over once or twice then sat up and rubbed his eyes ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was now clear sunrise soon the crew came on board in twos and threes the riggers bestirred themselves the mates were actively engaged and several of the shore people were busy in bringing various last things on board meanwhile captain ahab remained invisibly enshrined within his cabin ,MobyDick or The Whale
at length towards noon upon the final dismissal of the ships riggers and after the pequod had been hauled out from the wharf and after the everthoughtful charity had come off in a whaleboat with her last gifta nightcap for stubb the second mate her brotherinlaw and a spare bible for the stewardafter all this the two captains peleg and bildad issued from the cabin and turning to the chief mate peleg said ,MobyDick or The Whale
how now here upon the very point of starting for the voyage captain peleg and captain bildad were going it with a high hand on the quarterdeck just as if they were to be jointcommanders at sea as well as to all appearances in port and as for captain ahab no sign of him was yet to be seen only they said he was in the cabin but then the idea was that his presence was by no means necessary in getting the ship under weigh and steering her well out to sea indeed as that was not at all his proper business but the pilots and as he was not yet completely recoveredso they saidtherefore captain ahab stayed below and all this seemed natural enough especially as in the merchant service many captains never show themselves on deck for a considerable time after heaving up the anchor but remain over the cabin table having a farewell merrymaking with their shore friends before they quit the ship for good with the pilot ,MobyDick or The Whale
strike the tent therewas the next order as i hinted before this whalebone marquee was never pitched except in port and on board the pequod for thirty years the order to strike the tent was well known to be the next thing to heaving up the anchor ,MobyDick or The Whale
now in getting under weigh the station generally occupied by the pilot is the forward part of the ship and here bildad who with peleg be it known in addition to his other officers was one of the licensed pilots of the porthe being suspected to have got himself made a pilot in order to save the nantucket pilotfee to all the ships he was concerned in for he never piloted any other craftbildad i say might now be seen actively engaged in looking over the bows for the approaching anchor and at intervals singing what seemed a dismal stave of psalmody to cheer the hands at the windlass who roared forth some sort of a chorus about the girls in booble alley with hearty good will nevertheless not three days previous bildad had told them that no profane songs would be allowed on board the pequod particularly in getting under weigh and charity his sister had placed a small choice copy of watts in each seamans berth ,MobyDick or The Whale
meantime overseeing the other part of the ship captain peleg ripped and swore astern in the most frightful manner i almost thought he would sink the ship before the anchor could be got up involuntarily i paused on my handspike and told queequeg to do the same thinking of the perils we both ran in starting on the voyage with such a devil for a pilot i was comforting myself however with the thought that in pious bildad might be found some salvation spite of his seven hundred and seventyseventh lay when i felt a sudden sharp poke in my rear and turning round was horrified at the apparition of captain peleg in the act of withdrawing his leg from my immediate vicinity that was my first kick ,MobyDick or The Whale
is that the way they heave in the marchant service he roared spring thou sheephead spring and break thy backbone why dont ye spring i say all of yespring quohog spring thou chap with the red whiskers spring there scotchcap spring thou green pants spring i say all of ye and spring your eyes out and so saying he moved along the windlass here and there using his leg very freely while imperturbable bildad kept leading off with his psalmody thinks i captain peleg must have been drinking something today ,MobyDick or The Whale
at last the anchor was up the sails were set and off we glided it was a short cold christmas and as the short northern day merged into night we found ourselves almost broad upon the wintry ocean whose freezing spray cased us in ice as in polished armor the long rows of teeth on the bulwarks glistened in the moonlight and like the white ivory tusks of some huge elephant vast curving icicles depended from the bows ,MobyDick or The Whale
lank bildad as pilot headed the first watch and ever and anon as the old craft deep dived into the green seas and sent the shivering frost all over her and the winds howled and the cordage rang his steady notes were heard ,MobyDick or The Whale
never did those sweet words sound more sweetly to me than then they were full of hope and fruition spite of this frigid winter night in the boisterous atlantic spite of my wet feet and wetter jacket there was yet it then seemed to me many a pleasant haven in store and meads and glades so eternally vernal that the grass shot up by the spring untrodden unwilted remains at midsummer ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was curious and not unpleasing how peleg and bildad were affected at this juncture especially captain bildad for loath to depart yet very loath to leave for good a ship bound on so long and perilous a voyagebeyond both stormy capes a ship in which some thousands of his hard earned dollars were invested a ship in which an old shipmate sailed as captain a man almost as old as he once more starting to encounter all the terrors of the pitiless jaw loath to say goodbye to a thing so every way brimful of every interest to himpoor old bildad lingered long paced the deck with anxious strides ran down into the cabin to speak another farewell word there again came on deck and looked to windward looked towards the wide and endless waters only bounded by the faroff unseen eastern continents looked towards the land looked aloft looked right and left looked everywhere and nowhere and at last mechanically coiling a rope upon its pin convulsively grasped stout peleg by the hand and holding up a lantern for a moment stood gazing heroically in his face as much as to say nevertheless friend peleg i can stand it yes i can ,MobyDick or The Whale
as for peleg himself he took it more like a philosopher but for all his philosophy there was a tear twinkling in his eye when the lantern came too near and he too did not a little run from cabin to decknow a word below and now a word with starbuck the chief mate ,MobyDick or The Whale
but at last he turned to his comrade with a final sort of look about himcaptain bildadcome old shipmate we must go back the mainyard there boat ahoy stand by to come close alongside now careful carefulcome bildad boysay your last luck to ye starbuckluck to ye mr stubbluck to ye mr flaskgoodbye and good luck to ye alland this day three years ill have a hot supper smoking for ye in old nantucket hurrah and away ,MobyDick or The Whale

ship and boat diverged the cold damp night breeze blew between a screaming gull flew overhead the two hulls wildly rolled we gave three heavyhearted cheers and blindly plunged like fate into the lone atlantic ,MobyDick or The Whale
when on that shivering winters night the pequod thrust her vindictive bows into the cold malicious waves who should i see standing at her helm but bulkington i looked with sympathetic awe and fearfulness upon the man who in midwinter just landed from a four years dangerous voyage could so unrestingly push off again for still another tempestuous term the land seemed scorching to his feet wonderfullest things are ever the unmentionable deep memories yield no epitaphs this sixinch chapter is the stoneless grave of bulkington let me only say that it fared with him as with the stormtossed ship that miserably drives along the leeward land the port would fain give succor the port is pitiful in the port is safety comfort hearthstone supper warm blankets friends all thats kind to our mortalities but in that gale the port the land is that ships direst jeopardy she must fly all hospitality one touch of land though it but graze the keel would make her shudder through and through with all her might she crowds all sail off shore in so doing fights gainst the very winds that fain would blow her homeward seeks all the lashed seas landlessness again for refuges sake forlornly rushing into peril her only friend her bitterest foe ,MobyDick or The Whale
know ye now bulkington glimpses do ye seem to see of that mortally intolerable truth that all deep earnest thinking is but the intrepid effort of the soul to keep the open independence of her sea while the wildest winds of heaven and earth conspire to cast her on the treacherous slavish shore ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as in landlessness alone resides highest truth shoreless indefinite as godso better is it to perish in that howling infinite than be ingloriously dashed upon the lee even if that were safety for wormlike then oh who would craven crawl to land terrors of the terrible is all this agony so vain take heart take heart o bulkington bear thee grimly demigod up from the spray of thy oceanperishingstraight up leaps thy apotheosis ,MobyDick or The Whale
as queequeg and i are now fairly embarked in this business of whaling and as this business of whaling has somehow come to be regarded among landsmen as a rather unpoetical and disreputable pursuit therefore i am all anxiety to convince ye ye landsmen of the injustice hereby done to us hunters of whales ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the first place it may be deemed almost superfluous to establish the fact that among people at large the business of whaling is not accounted on a level with what are called the liberal professions if a stranger were introduced into any miscellaneous metropolitan society it would but slightly advance the general opinion of his merits were he presented to the company as a harpooneer say and if in emulation of the naval officers he should append the initials swf sperm whale fishery to his visiting card such a procedure would be deemed preeminently presuming and ridiculous ,MobyDick or The Whale
doubtless one leading reason why the world declines honoring us whalemen is this they think that at best our vocation amounts to a butchering sort of business and that when actively engaged therein we are surrounded by all manner of defilements butchers we are that is true but butchers also and butchers of the bloodiest badge have been all martial commanders whom the world invariably delights to honor and as for the matter of the alleged uncleanliness of our business ye shall soon be initiated into certain facts hitherto pretty generally unknown and which upon the whole will triumphantly plant the sperm whaleship at least among the cleanliest things of this tidy earth but even granting the charge in question to be true what disordered slippery decks of a whaleship are comparable to the unspeakable carrion of those battlefields from which so many soldiers return to drink in all ladies plaudits and if the idea of peril so much enhances the popular conceit of the soldiers profession let me assure ye that many a veteran who has freely marched up to a battery would quickly recoil at the apparition of the sperm whales vast tail fanning into eddies the air over his head for what are the comprehensible terrors of man compared with the interlinked terrors and wonders of god ,MobyDick or The Whale
but though the world scouts at us whale hunters yet does it unwittingly pay us the profoundest homage yea an allabounding adoration for almost all the tapers lamps and candles that burn round the globe burn as before so many shrines to our glory ,MobyDick or The Whale
why did the dutch in de witts time have admirals of their whaling fleets why did louis xvi of france at his own personal expense fit out whaling ships from dunkirk and politely invite to that town some score or two of families from our own island of nantucket why did britain between the years  and  pay to her whalemen in bounties upwards of  and lastly how comes it that we whalemen of america now outnumber all the rest of the banded whalemen in the world sail a navy of upwards of seven hundred vessels manned by eighteen thousand men yearly consuming  of dollars the ships worth at the time of sailing  and every year importing into our harbors a well reaped harvest of  how comes all this if there be not something puissant in whaling ,MobyDick or The Whale
i freely assert that the cosmopolite philosopher cannot for his life point out one single peaceful influence which within the last sixty years has operated more potentially upon the whole broad world taken in one aggregate than the high and mighty business of whaling one way and another it has begotten events so remarkable in themselves and so continuously momentous in their sequential issues that whaling may well be regarded as that egyptian mother who bore offspring themselves pregnant from her womb it would be a hopeless endless task to catalogue all these things let a handful suffice for many years past the whaleship has been the pioneer in ferreting out the remotest and least known parts of the earth she has explored seas and archipelagoes which had no chart where no cook or vancouver had ever sailed if american and european menofwar now peacefully ride in once savage harbors let them fire salutes to the honor and glory of the whaleship which originally showed them the way and first interpreted between them and the savages they may celebrate as they will the heroes of exploring expeditions your cooks your krusensterns but i say that scores of anonymous captains have sailed out of nantucket that were as great and greater than your cook and your krusenstern for in their succourless emptyhandedness they in the heathenish sharked waters and by the beaches of unrecorded javelin islands battled with virgin wonders and terrors that cook with all his marines and muskets would not willingly have dared all that is made such a flourish of in the old south sea voyages those things were but the lifetime commonplaces of our heroic nantucketers often adventures which vancouver dedicates three chapters to these men accounted unworthy of being set down in the ships common log ah the world oh the world ,MobyDick or The Whale
until the whale fishery rounded cape horn no commerce but colonial scarcely any intercourse but colonial was carried on between europe and the long line of the opulent spanish provinces on the pacific coast it was the whaleman who first broke through the jealous policy of the spanish crown touching those colonies and if space permitted it might be distinctly shown how from those whalemen at last eventuated the liberation of peru chili and bolivia from the yoke of old spain and the establishment of the eternal democracy in those parts ,MobyDick or The Whale
that great america on the other side of the sphere australia was given to the enlightened world by the whaleman after its first blunderborn discovery by a dutchman all other ships long shunned those shores as pestiferously barbarous but the whaleship touched there the whaleship is the true mother of that now mighty colony moreover in the infancy of the first australian settlement the emigrants were several times saved from starvation by the benevolent biscuit of the whaleship luckily dropping an anchor in their waters the uncounted isles of all polynesia confess the same truth and do commercial homage to the whaleship that cleared the way for the missionary and the merchant and in many cases carried the primitive missionaries to their first destinations if that doublebolted land japan is ever to become hospitable it is the whaleship alone to whom the credit will be due for already she is on the threshold ,MobyDick or The Whale
but if in the face of all this you still declare that whaling has no sthetically noble associations connected with it then am i ready to shiver fifty lances with you there and unhorse you with a split helmet every time ,MobyDick or The Whale
the whale no famous author and whaling no famous chronicler who wrote the first account of our leviathan who but mighty job and who composed the first narrative of a whalingvoyage who but no less a prince than alfred the great who with his own royal pen took down the words from other the norwegian whalehunter of those times and who pronounced our glowing eulogy in parliament who but edmund burke ,MobyDick or The Whale

the whale never figured in any grand imposing way in one of the mighty triumphs given to a roman general upon his entering the worlds capital the bones of a whale brought all the way from the syrian coast were the most conspicuous object in the cymballed procession ,MobyDick or The Whale
no dignity in whaling the dignity of our calling the very heavens attest cetus is a constellation in the south no more drive down your hat in presence of the czar and take it off to queequeg no more i know a man that in his lifetime has taken three hundred and fifty whales i account that man more honorable than that great captain of antiquity who boasted of taking as many walled towns ,MobyDick or The Whale
and as for me if by any possibility there be any as yet undiscovered prime thing in me if i shall ever deserve any real repute in that small but high hushed world which i might not be unreasonably ambitious of if hereafter i shall do anything that upon the whole a man might rather have done than to have left undone if at my death my executors or more properly my creditors find any precious mss in my desk then here i prospectively ascribe all the honor and the glory to whaling for a whaleship was my yale college and my harvard ,MobyDick or The Whale
in behalf of the dignity of whaling i would fain advance naught but substantiated facts but after embattling his facts an advocate who should wholly suppress a not unreasonable surmise which might tell eloquently upon his causesuch an advocate would he not be blameworthy ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is well known that at the coronation of kings and queens even modern ones a certain curious process of seasoning them for their functions is gone through there is a saltcellar of state so called and there may be a castor of state how they use the salt preciselywho knows certain i am however that a kings head is solemnly oiled at his coronation even as a head of salad can it be though that they anoint it with a view of making its interior run well as they anoint machinery much might be ruminated here concerning the essential dignity of this regal process because in common life we esteem but meanly and contemptibly a fellow who anoints his hair and palpably smells of that anointing in truth a mature man who uses hairoil unless medicinally that man has probably got a quoggy spot in him somewhere as a general rule he cant amount to much in his totality ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the only thing to be considered here is thiswhat kind of oil is used at coronations certainly it cannot be olive oil nor macassar oil nor castor oil nor bears oil nor train oil nor codliver oil what then can it possibly be but sperm oil in its unmanufactured unpolluted state the sweetest of all oils ,MobyDick or The Whale
the chief mate of the pequod was starbuck a native of nantucket and a quaker by descent he was a long earnest man and though born on an icy coast seemed well adapted to endure hot latitudes his flesh being hard as twicebaked biscuit transported to the indies his live blood would not spoil like bottled ale he must have been born in some time of general drought and famine or upon one of those fast days for which his state is famous only some thirty arid summers had he seen those summers had dried up all his physical superfluousness but this his thinness so to speak seemed no more the token of wasting anxieties and cares than it seemed the indication of any bodily blight it was merely the condensation of the man he was by no means illlooking quite the contrary his pure tight skin was an excellent fit and closely wrapped up in it and embalmed with inner health and strength like a revivified egyptian this starbuck seemed prepared to endure for long ages to come and to endure always as now for be it polar snow or torrid sun like a patent chronometer his interior vitality was warranted to do well in all climates looking into his eyes you seemed to see there the yet lingering images of those thousandfold perils he had calmly confronted through life a staid steadfast man whose life for the most part was a telling pantomime of action and not a tame were certain qualities in him which at times affected and in some cases seemed well nigh to overbalance all the rest uncommonly conscientious for a seaman and endued with a deep natural reverence the wild watery loneliness of his life did therefore strongly incline him to superstition but to that sort of superstition which in some organizations seems rather to spring somehow from intelligence than from ignorance outward portents and inward presentiments were his and if at times these things bent the welded iron of his soul much more did his faraway domestic memories of his young cape wife and child tend to bend him still more from the original ruggedness of his nature and open him still further to those latent influences which in some honesthearted men restrain the gush of daredevil daring so often evinced by others in the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery i will have no man in my boat said starbuck who is not afraid of a whale by this he seemed to mean not only that the most reliable and useful courage was that which arises from the fair estimation of the encountered peril but that an utterly fearless man is a far more dangerous comrade than a coward ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye aye said stubb the second mate starbuck there is as careful a man as youll find anywhere in this fishery but we shall ere long see what that word careful precisely means when used by a man like stubb or almost any other whale hunter ,MobyDick or The Whale
starbuck was no crusader after perils in him courage was not a sentiment but a thing simply useful to him and always at hand upon all mortally practical occasions besides he thought perhaps that in this business of whaling courage was one of the great staple outfits of the ship like her beef and her bread and not to be foolishly wasted wherefore he had no fancy for lowering for whales after sundown nor for persisting in fighting a fish that too much persisted in fighting him for thought starbuck i am here in this critical ocean to kill whales for my living and not to be killed by them for theirs and that hundreds of men had been so killed starbuck well knew what doom was his own fathers where in the bottomless deeps could he find the torn limbs of his brother ,MobyDick or The Whale
with memories like these in him and moreover given to a certain superstitiousness as has been said the courage of this starbuck which could nevertheless still flourish must indeed have been extreme but it was not in reasonable nature that a man so organized and with such terrible experiences and remembrances as he had it was not in nature that these things should fail in latently engendering an element in him which under suitable circumstances would break out from its confinement and burn all his courage up and brave as he might be it was that sort of bravery chiefly visible in some intrepid men which while generally abiding firm in the conflict with seas or winds or whales or any of the ordinary irrational horrors of the world yet cannot withstand those more terrific because more spiritual terrors which sometimes menace you from the concentrating brow of an enraged and mighty man ,MobyDick or The Whale
but were the coming narrative to reveal in any instance the complete abasement of poor starbucks fortitude scarce might i have the heart to write it for it is a thing most sorrowful nay shocking to expose the fall of valour in the soul men may seem detestable as joint stockcompanies and nations knaves fools and murderers there may be men may have mean and meagre faces but man in the ideal is so noble and so sparkling such a grand and glowing creature that over any ignominious blemish in him all his fellows should run to throw their costliest robes that immaculate manliness we feel within ourselves so far within us that it remains intact though all the outer character seem gone bleeds with keenest anguish at the undraped spectacle of a valorruined man nor can piety itself at such a shameful sight completely stifle her upbraidings against the permitting stars but this august dignity i treat of is not the dignity of kings and robes but that abounding dignity which has no robed investiture thou shalt see it shining in the arm that wields a pick or drives a spike that democratic dignity which on all hands radiates without end from god himself the great god absolute the centre and circumference of all democracy his omnipresence our divine equality ,MobyDick or The Whale
if then to meanest mariners and renegades and castaways i shall hereafter ascribe high qualities though dark weave round them tragic graces if even the most mournful perchance the most abased among them all shall at times lift himself to the exalted mounts if i shall touch that workmans arm with some ethereal light if i shall spread a rainbow over his disastrous set of sun then against all mortal critics bear me out in it thou just spirit of equality which hast spread one royal mantle of humanity over all my kind bear me out in it thou great democratic god who didst not refuse to the swart convict bunyan the pale poetic pearl thou who didst clothe with doubly hammered leaves of finest gold the stumped and paupered arm of old cervantes thou who didst pick up andrew jackson from the pebbles who didst hurl him upon a warhorse who didst thunder him higher than a throne thou who in all thy mighty earthly marchings ever cullest thy selectest champions from the kingly commons bear me out in it o god ,MobyDick or The Whale
stubb was the second mate he was a native of cape cod and hence according to local usage was called a capecodman a happygolucky neither craven nor valiant taking perils as they came with an indifferent air and while engaged in the most imminent crisis of the chase toiling away calm and collected as a journeyman joiner engaged for the year goodhumored easy and careless he presided over his whaleboat as if the most deadly encounter were but a dinner and his crew all invited guests he was as particular about the comfortable arrangement of his part of the boat as an old stagedriver is about the snugness of his box when close to the whale in the very deathlock of the fight he handled his unpitying lance coolly and offhandedly as a whistling tinker his hammer he would hum over his old rigadig tunes while flank and flank with the most exasperated monster long usage had for this stubb converted the jaws of death into an easy chair what he thought of death itself there is no telling whether he ever thought of it at all might be a question but if he ever did chance to cast his mind that way after a comfortable dinner no doubt like a good sailor he took it to be a sort of call of the watch to tumble aloft and bestir themselves there about something which he would find out when he obeyed the order and not sooner ,MobyDick or The Whale
what perhaps with other things made stubb such an easygoing unfearing man so cheerily trudging off with the burden of life in a world full of grave pedlars all bowed to the ground with their packs what helped to bring about that almost impious goodhumor of his that thing must have been his pipe for like his nose his short black little pipe was one of the regular features of his face you would almost as soon have expected him to turn out of his bunk without his nose as without his pipe he kept a whole row of pipes there ready loaded stuck in a rack within easy reach of his hand and whenever he turned in he smoked them all out in succession lighting one from the other to the end of the chapter then loading them again to be in readiness anew for when stubb dressed instead of first putting his legs into his trowsers he put his pipe into his mouth ,MobyDick or The Whale
i say this continual smoking must have been one cause at least of his peculiar disposition for every one knows that this earthly air whether ashore or afloat is terribly infected with the nameless miseries of the numberless mortals who have died exhaling it and as in time of the cholera some people go about with a camphorated handkerchief to their mouths so likewise against all mortal tribulations stubbs tobacco smoke might have operated as a sort of disinfecting agent ,MobyDick or The Whale
the third mate was flask a native of tisbury in marthas vineyard a short stout ruddy young fellow very pugnacious concerning whales who somehow seemed to think that the great leviathans had personally and hereditarily affronted him and therefore it was a sort of point of honor with him to destroy them whenever encountered so utterly lost was he to all sense of reverence for the many marvels of their majestic bulk and mystic ways and so dead to anything like an apprehension of any possible danger from encountering them that in his poor opinion the wondrous whale was but a species of magnified mouse or at least waterrat requiring only a little circumvention and some small application of time and trouble in order to kill and boil this ignorant unconscious fearlessness of his made him a little waggish in the matter of whales he followed these fish for the fun of it and a three years voyage round cape horn was only a jolly joke that lasted that length of time as a carpenters nails are divided into wrought nails and cut nails so mankind may be similarly divided little flask was one of the wrought ones made to clinch tight and last long they called him kingpost on board of the pequod because in form he could be well likened to the short square timber known by that name in arctic whalers and which by the means of many radiating side timbers inserted into it serves to brace the ship against the icy concussions of those battering seas ,MobyDick or The Whale
now these three matesstarbuck stubb and flask were momentous men they it was who by universal prescription commanded three of the pequods boats as headsmen in that grand order of battle in which captain ahab would probably marshal his forces to descend on the whales these three headsmen were as captains of companies or being armed with their long keen whaling spears they were as a picked trio of lancers even as the harpooneers were flingers of javelins ,MobyDick or The Whale
and since in this famous fishery each mate or headsman like a gothic knight of old is always accompanied by his boatsteerer or harpooneer who in certain conjunctures provides him with a fresh lance when the former one has been badly twisted or elbowed in the assault and moreover as there generally subsists between the two a close intimacy and friendliness it is therefore but meet that in this place we set down who the pequods harpooneers were and to what headsman each of them belonged ,MobyDick or The Whale
next was tashtego an unmixed indian from gay head the most westerly promontory of marthas vineyard where there still exists the last remnant of a village of red men which has long supplied the neighboring island of nantucket with many of her most daring harpooneers in the fishery they usually go by the generic name of gayheaders tashtegos long lean sable hair his high cheek bones and black rounding eyesfor an indian oriental in their largeness but antarctic in their glittering expressionall this sufficiently proclaimed him an inheritor of the unvitiated blood of those proud warrior hunters who in quest of the great new england moose had scoured bow in hand the aboriginal forests of the main but no longer snuffing in the trail of the wild beasts of the woodland tashtego now hunted in the wake of the great whales of the sea the unerring harpoon of the son fitly replacing the infallible arrow of the sires to look at the tawny brawn of his lithe snaky limbs you would almost have credited the superstitions of some of the earlier puritans and halfbelieved this wild indian to be a son of the prince of the powers of the air tashtego was stubb the second mates squire ,MobyDick or The Whale
third among the harpooneers was daggoo a gigantic coalblack negrosavage with a lionlike treadan ahasuerus to behold suspended from his ears were two golden hoops so large that the sailors called them ringbolts and would talk of securing the topsail halyards to them in his youth daggoo had voluntarily shipped on board of a whaler lying in a lonely bay on his native coast and never having been anywhere in the world but in africa nantucket and the pagan harbors most frequented by whalemen and having now led for many years the bold life of the fishery in the ships of owners uncommonly heedful of what manner of men they shipped daggoo retained all his barbaric virtues and erect as a giraffe moved about the decks in all the pomp of six feet five in his socks there was a corporeal humility in looking up at him and a white man standing before him seemed a white flag come to beg truce of a fortress curious to tell this imperial negro ahasuerus daggoo was the squire of little flask who looked like a chessman beside him as for the residue of the pequods company be it said that at the present day not one in two of the many thousand men before the mast employed in the american whale fishery are americans born though pretty nearly all the officers are herein it is the same with the american whale fishery as with the american army and military and merchant navies and the engineering forces employed in the construction of the american canals and railroads the same i say because in all these cases the native american liberally provides the brains the rest of the world as generously supplying the muscles no small number of these whaling seamen belong to the azores where the outward bound nantucket whalers frequently touch to augment their crews from the hardy peasants of those rocky shores in like manner the greenland whalers sailing out of hull or london put in at the shetland islands to receive the full complement of their crew upon the passage homewards they drop them there again how it is there is no telling but islanders seem to make the best whalemen they were nearly all islanders in the pequod isolatoes too i call such not acknowledging the common continent of men but each isolato living on a separate continent of his own yet now federated along one keel what a set these isolatoes were an anacharsis clootz deputation from all the isles of the sea and all the ends of the earth accompanying old ahab in the pequod to lay the worlds grievances before that bar from which not very many of them ever come back black little piphe never didoh no he went before poor alabama boy on the grim pequods forecastle ye shall ere long see him beating his tambourine prelusive of the eternal time when sent for to the great quarterdeck on high he was bid strike in with angels and beat his tambourine in glory called a coward here hailed a hero there ,MobyDick or The Whale
for several days after leaving nantucket nothing above hatches was seen of captain ahab the mates regularly relieved each other at the watches and for aught that could be seen to the contrary they seemed to be the only commanders of the ship only they sometimes issued from the cabin with orders so sudden and peremptory that after all it was plain they but commanded vicariously yes their supreme lord and dictator was there though hitherto unseen by any eyes not permitted to penetrate into the now sacred retreat of the cabin ,MobyDick or The Whale
every time i ascended to the deck from my watches below i instantly gazed aft to mark if any strange face were visible for my first vague disquietude touching the unknown captain now in the seclusion of the sea became almost a perturbation this was strangely heightened at times by the ragged elijahs diabolical incoherences uninvitedly recurring to me with a subtle energy i could not have before conceived of but poorly could i withstand them much as in other moods i was almost ready to smile at the solemn whimsicalities of that outlandish prophet of the wharves but whatever it was of apprehensiveness or uneasinessto call it sowhich i felt yet whenever i came to look about me in the ship it seemed against all warrantry to cherish such emotions for though the harpooneers with the great body of the crew were a far more barbaric heathenish and motley set than any of the tame merchantship companies which my previous experiences had made me acquainted with still i ascribed thisand rightly ascribed itto the fierce uniqueness of the very nature of that wild scandinavian vocation in which i had so abandonedly embarked but it was especially the aspect of the three chief officers of the ship the mates which was most forcibly calculated to allay these colourless misgivings and induce confidence and cheerfulness in every presentment of the voyage three better more likely seaofficers and men each in his own different way could not readily be found and they were every one of them americans a nantucketer a vineyarder a cape man now it being christmas when the ship shot from out her harbor for a space we had biting polar weather though all the time running away from it to the southward and by every degree and minute of latitude which we sailed gradually leaving that merciless winter and all its intolerable weather behind us it was one of those less lowering but still grey and gloomy enough mornings of the transition when with a fair wind the ship was rushing through the water with a vindictive sort of leaping and melancholy rapidity that as i mounted to the deck at the call of the forenoon watch so soon as i levelled my glance towards the taffrail foreboding shivers ran over me reality outran apprehension captain ahab stood upon his quarterdeck ,MobyDick or The Whale
there seemed no sign of common bodily illness about him nor of the recovery from any he looked like a man cut away from the stake when the fire has overrunningly wasted all the limbs without consuming them or taking away one particle from their compacted aged robustness his whole high broad form seemed made of solid bronze and shaped in an unalterable mould like cellinis cast perseus threading its way out from among his grey hairs and continuing right down one side of his tawny scorched face and neck till it disappeared in his clothing you saw a slender rodlike mark lividly whitish it resembled that perpendicular seam sometimes made in the straight lofty trunk of a great tree when the upper lightning tearingly darts down it and without wrenching a single twig peels and grooves out the bark from top to bottom ere running off into the soil leaving the tree still greenly alive but branded whether that mark was born with him or whether it was the scar left by some desperate wound no one could certainly say by some tacit consent throughout the voyage little or no allusion was made to it especially by the mates but once tashtegos senior an old gayhead indian among the crew superstitiously asserted that not till he was full forty years old did ahab become that way branded and then it came upon him not in the fury of any mortal fray but in an elemental strife at sea yet this wild hint seemed inferentially negatived by what a grey manxman insinuated an old sepulchral man who having never before sailed out of nantucket had never ere this laid eye upon wild ahab nevertheless the old seatraditions the immemorial credulities popularly invested this old manxman with preternatural powers of discernment so that no white sailor seriously contradicted him when he said that if ever captain ahab should be tranquilly laid outwhich might hardly come to pass so he mutteredthen whoever should do that last office for the dead would find a birthmark on him from crown to sole ,MobyDick or The Whale
so powerfully did the whole grim aspect of ahab affect me and the livid brand which streaked it that for the first few moments i hardly noted that not a little of this overbearing grimness was owing to the barbaric white leg upon which he partly stood it had previously come to me that this ivory leg had at sea been fashioned from the polished bone of the sperm whales jaw aye he was dismasted off japan said the old gayhead indian once but like his dismasted craft he shipped another mast without coming home for it he has a quiver of em ,MobyDick or The Whale
i was struck with the singular posture he maintained upon each side of the pequods quarter deck and pretty close to the mizzen shrouds there was an auger hole bored about half an inch or so into the plank his bone leg steadied in that hole one arm elevated and holding by a shroud captain ahab stood erect looking straight out beyond the ships everpitching prow there was an infinity of firmest fortitude a determinate unsurrenderable wilfulness in the fixed and fearless forward dedication of that glance not a word he spoke nor did his officers say aught to him though by all their minutest gestures and expressions they plainly showed the uneasy if not painful consciousness of being under a troubled mastereye and not only that but moody stricken ahab stood before them with a crucifixion in his face in all the nameless regal overbearing dignity of some mighty woe ,MobyDick or The Whale
ere long from his first visit in the air he withdrew into his cabin but after that morning he was every day visible to the crew either standing in his pivothole or seated upon an ivory stool he had or heavily walking the deck as the sky grew less gloomy indeed began to grow a little genial he became still less and less a recluse as if when the ship had sailed from home nothing but the dead wintry bleakness of the sea had then kept him so secluded and by and by it came to pass that he was almost continually in the air but as yet for all that he said or perceptibly did on the at last sunny deck he seemed as unnecessary there as another mast but the pequod was only making a passage now not regularly cruising nearly all whaling preparatives needing supervision the mates were fully competent to so that there was little or nothing out of himself to employ or excite ahab now and thus chase away for that one interval the clouds that layer upon layer were piled upon his brow as ever all clouds choose the loftiest peaks to pile themselves upon ,MobyDick or The Whale
nevertheless ere long the warm warbling persuasiveness of the pleasant holiday weather we came to seemed gradually to charm him from his mood for as when the redcheeked dancing girls april and may trip home to the wintry misanthropic woods even the barest ruggedest most thundercloven old oak will at least send forth some few green sprouts to welcome such gladhearted visitants so ahab did in the end a little respond to the playful allurings of that girlish air more than once did he put forth the faint blossom of a look which in any other man would have soon flowered out in a smile ,MobyDick or The Whale
some days elapsed and ice and icebergs all astern the pequod now went rolling through the bright quito spring which at sea almost perpetually reigns on the threshold of the eternal august of the tropic the warmly cool clear ringing perfumed overflowing redundant days were as crystal goblets of persian sherbet heaped upflaked up with rosewater snow the starred and stately nights seemed haughty dames in jewelled velvets nursing at home in lonely pride the memory of their absent conquering earls the golden helmeted suns for sleeping man twas hard to choose between such winsome days and such seducing nights but all the witcheries of that unwaning weather did not merely lend new spells and potencies to the outward world inward they turned upon the soul especially when the still mild hours of eve came on then memory shot her crystals as the clear ice most forms of noiseless twilights and all these subtle agencies more and more they wrought on ahabs texture ,MobyDick or The Whale
old age is always wakeful as if the longer linked with life the less man has to do with aught that looks like death among seacommanders the old greybeards will oftenest leave their berths to visit the nightcloaked deck it was so with ahab only that now of late he seemed so much to live in the open air that truly speaking his visits were more to the cabin than from the cabin to the planks it feels like going down into ones tombhe would mutter to himselffor an old captain like me to be descending this narrow scuttle to go to my gravedug berth ,MobyDick or The Whale
so almost every twentyfour hours when the watches of the night were set and the band on deck sentinelled the slumbers of the band below and when if a rope was to be hauled upon the forecastle the sailors flung it not rudely down as by day but with some cautiousness dropt it to its place for fear of disturbing their slumbering shipmates when this sort of steady quietude would begin to prevail habitually the silent steersman would watch the cabinscuttle and ere long the old man would emerge gripping at the iron banister to help his crippled way some considering touch of humanity was in him for at times like these he usually abstained from patrolling the quarterdeck because to his wearied mates seeking repose within six inches of his ivory heel such would have been the reverberating crack and din of that bony step that their dreams would have been on the crunching teeth of sharks but once the mood was on him too deep for common regardings and as with heavy lumberlike pace he was measuring the ship from taffrail to mainmast stubb the old second mate came up from below with a certain unassured deprecating humorousness hinted that if captain ahab was pleased to walk the planks then no one could say nay but there might be some way of muffling the noise hinting something indistinctly and hesitatingly about a globe of tow and the insertion into it of the ivory heel ah stubb thou didst not know ahab then ,MobyDick or The Whale
am i a cannonball stubb said ahab that thou wouldst wad me that fashion but go thy ways i had forgot below to thy nightly grave where such as ye sleep between shrouds to use ye to the filling one at lastdown dog and kennel ,MobyDick or The Whale
starting at the unforseen concluding exclamation of the so suddenly scornful old man stubb was speechless a moment then said excitedly i am not used to be spoken to that way sir i do but less than half like it sir ,MobyDick or The Whale
i was never served so before without giving a hard blow for it muttered stubb as he found himself descending the cabinscuttle its very queer stop stubb somehow now i dont well know whether to go back and strike him orwhats thatdown here on my knees and pray for him yes that was the thought coming up in me but it would be the first time i ever did pray its queer very queer and hes queer too aye take him fore and aft hes about the queerest old man stubb ever sailed with how he flashed at mehis eyes like powderpans is he mad anyway theres something on his mind as sure as there must be something on a deck when it cracks he aint in his bed now either more than three hours out of the twentyfour and he dont sleep then didnt that doughboy the steward tell me that of a morning he always finds the old mans hammock clothes all rumpled and tumbled and the sheets down at the foot and the coverlid almost tied into knots and the pillow a sort of frightful hot as though a baked brick had been on it a hot old man i guess hes got what some folks ashore call a conscience its a kind of ticdollyrow they sayworse nor a toothache well well i dont know what it is but the lord keep me from catching it hes full of riddles i wonder what he goes into the after hold for every night as doughboy tells me he suspects whats that for i should like to know whos made appointments with him in the hold aint that queer now but theres no telling its the old gamehere goes for a snooze damn me its worth a fellows while to be born into the world if only to fall right asleep and now that i think of it thats about the first thing babies do and thats a sort of queer too damn me but all things are queer come to think of em but thats against my principles think not is my eleventh commandment and sleep when you can is my twelfthso here goes again but hows that didnt he call me a dog blazes he called me ten times a donkey and piled a lot of jackasses on top of that he might as well have kicked me and done with it maybe he did kick me and i didnt observe it i was so taken all aback with his brow somehow it flashed like a bleached bone what the devils the matter with me i dont stand right on my legs coming afoul of that old man has a sort of turned me wrong side out by the lord i must have been dreaming thoughhow how howbut the only ways to stash it so here goes to hammock again and in the morning ill see how this plaguey juggling thinks over by daylight ,MobyDick or The Whale
when stubb had departed ahab stood for a while leaning over the bulwarks and then as had been usual with him of late calling a sailor of the watch he sent him below for his ivory stool and also his pipe lighting the pipe at the binnacle lamp and planting the stool on the weather side of the deck he sat and smoked ,MobyDick or The Whale
in old norse times the thrones of the sealoving danish kings were fabricated saith tradition of the tusks of the narwhale how could one look at ahab then seated on that tripod of bones without bethinking him of the royalty it symbolized for a khan of the plank and a king of the sea and a great lord of leviathans was ahab ,MobyDick or The Whale
some moments passed during which the thick vapor came from his mouth in quick and constant puffs which blew back again into his face how now he soliloquized at last withdrawing the tube this smoking no longer soothes oh my pipe hard must it go with me if thy charm be gone here have i been unconsciously toiling not pleasuringaye and ignorantly smoking to windward all the while to windward and with such nervous whiffs as if like the dying whale my final jets were the strongest and fullest of trouble what business have i with this pipe this thing that is meant for sereneness to send up mild white vapors among mild white hairs not among torn irongrey locks like mine ill smoke no more ,MobyDick or The Whale
such a queer dream kingpost i never had you know the old mans ivory leg well i dreamed he kicked me with it and when i tried to kick back upon my soul my little man i kicked my leg right off and then presto ahab seemed a pyramid and i like a blazing fool kept kicking at it but what was still more curious flaskyou know how curious all dreams arethrough all this rage that i was in i somehow seemed to be thinking to myself that after all it was not much of an insult that kick from ahab why thinks i whats the row its not a real leg only a false leg and theres a mighty difference between a living thump and a dead thump thats what makes a blow from the hand flask fifty times more savage to bear than a blow from a cane the living memberthat makes the living insult my little man and thinks i to myself all the while mind while i was stubbing my silly toes against that cursed pyramidso confoundedly contradictory was it all all the while i say i was thinking to myself whats his leg now but a canea whalebone cane yes thinks i it was only a playful cudgellingin fact only a whaleboning that he gave menot a base kick besides thinks i look at it once why the end of itthe foot partwhat a small sort of end it is whereas if a broad footed farmer kicked me theres a devilish broad insult but this insult is whittled down to a point only but now comes the greatest joke of the dream flask while i was battering away at the pyramid a sort of badgerhaired old merman with a hump on his back takes me by the shoulders and slews me round what are you bout says he slid man but i was frightened such a phiz but somehow next moment i was over the fright what am i about says i at last and what business is that of yours i should like to know mr humpback do you want a kick by the lord flask i had no sooner said that than he turned round his stern to me bent over and dragging up a lot of seaweed he had for a cloutwhat do you think i sawwhy thunder alive man his stern was stuck full of marlinspikes with the points out says i on second thoughts i guess i wont kick you old fellow wise stubb said he wise stubb and kept muttering it all the time a sort of eating of his own gums like a chimney hag seeing he wasnt going to stop saying over his wise stubb wise stubb i thought i might as well fall to kicking the pyramid again but i had only just lifted my foot for it when he roared out stop that kicking halloa says i whats the matter now old fellow look ye here says he lets argue the insult captain ahab kicked ye didnt he yes he did says iright here it was very good says hehe used his ivory leg didnt he yes he did says i well then says he wise stubb what have you to complain of didnt he kick with right good will it wasnt a common pitch pine leg he kicked with was it no you were kicked by a great man and with a beautiful ivory leg stubb its an honor i consider it an honor listen wise stubb in old england the greatest lords think it great glory to be slapped by a queen and made garterknights of but be your boast stubb that ye were kicked by old ahab and made a wise man of remember what i say be kicked by him account his kicks honors and on no account kick back for you cant help yourself wise stubb dont you see that pyramid with that he all of a sudden seemed somehow in some queer fashion to swim off into the air i snored rolled over and there i was in my hammock now what do you think of that dream flask ,MobyDick or The Whale
may be may be but its made a wise man of me flask dye see ahab standing there sideways looking over the stern well the best thing you can do flask is to let the old man alone never speak to him whatever he says halloa whats that he shouts hark ,MobyDick or The Whale
what do you think of that now flask aint there a small drop of something queer about that eh a white whaledid ye mark that man look yetheres something special in the wind stand by for it flask ahab has that thats bloody on his mind but mum he comes this way ,MobyDick or The Whale
already we are boldly launched upon the deep but soon we shall be lost in its unshored harbourless immensities ere that come to pass ere the pequods weedy hull rolls side by side with the barnacled hulls of the leviathan at the outset it is but well to attend to a matter almost indispensable to a thorough appreciative understanding of the more special leviathanic revelations and allusions of all sorts which are to follow ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is some systematized exhibition of the whale in his broad genera that i would now fain put before you yet is it no easy task the classification of the constituents of a chaos nothing less is here essayed listen to what the best and latest authorities have laid down ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is not my intention were it in my power to enter into the inquiry as to the true method of dividing the cetacea into groups and families    utter confusion exists among the historians of this animal sperm whale says surgeon beale ad  ,MobyDick or The Whale
unfitness to pursue our research in the unfathomable waters impenetrable veil covering our knowledge of the cetacea a field strewn with thorns all these incomplete indications but serve to torture us naturalists ,MobyDick or The Whale
thus speak of the whale the great cuvier and john hunter and lesson those lights of zoology and anatomy nevertheless though of real knowledge there be little yet of books there are a plenty and so in some small degree with cetology or the science of whales many are the men small and great old and new landsmen and seamen who have at large or in little written of the whale run over a fewthe authors of the bible aristotle pliny aldrovandi sir thomas browne gesner ray linnus rondeletius willoughby green artedi sibbald brisson marten lacpde bonneterre desmarest baron cuvier frederick cuvier john hunter owen scoresby beale bennett j ross browne the author of miriam coffin olmstead and the rev t cheever but to what ultimate generalizing purpose all these have written the above cited extracts will show ,MobyDick or The Whale
of the names in this list of whale authors only those following owen ever saw living whales and but one of them was a real professional harpooneer and whaleman i mean captain scoresby on the separate subject of the greenland or rightwhale he is the best existing authority but scoresby knew nothing and says nothing of the great sperm whale compared with which the greenland whale is almost unworthy mentioning and here be it said that the greenland whale is an usurper upon the throne of the seas he is not even by any means the largest of the whales yet owing to the long priority of his claims and the profound ignorance which till some seventy years back invested the then fabulous or utterly unknown spermwhale and which ignorance to this present day still reigns in all but some few scientific retreats and whaleports this usurpation has been every way complete reference to nearly all the leviathanic allusions in the great poets of past days will satisfy you that the greenland whale without one rival was to them the monarch of the seas but the time has at last come for a new proclamation this is charing cross hear ye good people allthe greenland whale is deposedthe great sperm whale now reigneth ,MobyDick or The Whale
there are only two books in being which at all pretend to put the living sperm whale before you and at the same time in the remotest degree succeed in the attempt those books are beales and bennetts both in their time surgeons to english southsea whaleships and both exact and reliable men the original matter touching the sperm whale to be found in their volumes is necessarily small but so far as it goes it is of excellent quality though mostly confined to scientific description as yet however the sperm whale scientific or poetic lives not complete in any literature far above all other hunted whales his is an unwritten life ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the various species of whales need some sort of popular comprehensive classification if only an easy outline one for the present hereafter to be filled in all its departments by subsequent laborers as no better man advances to take this matter in hand i hereupon offer my own poor endeavors i promise nothing complete because any human thing supposed to be complete must for that very reason infallibly be faulty i shall not pretend to a minute anatomical description of the various species orin this place at leastto much of any description my object here is simply to project the draught of a systematization of cetology i am the architect not the builder ,MobyDick or The Whale
but it is a ponderous task no ordinary lettersorter in the postoffice is equal to it to grope down into the bottom of the sea after them to have ones hands among the unspeakable foundations ribs and very pelvis of the world this is a fearful thing what am i that i should essay to hook the nose of this leviathan the awful tauntings in job might well appal me will he the leviathan make a covenant with thee behold the hope of him is vain but i have swam through libraries and sailed through oceans i have had to do with whales with these visible hands i am in earnest and i will try there are some preliminaries to settle ,MobyDick or The Whale
first the uncertain unsettled condition of this science of cetology is in the very vestibule attested by the fact that in some quarters it still remains a moot point whether a whale be a fish in his system of nature ad  linnus declares i hereby separate the whales from the fish but of my own knowledge i know that down to the year  sharks and shad alewives and herring against linnuss express edict were still found dividing the possession of the same seas with the leviathan ,MobyDick or The Whale
the grounds upon which linnus would fain have banished the whales from the waters he states as follows on account of their warm bilocular heart their lungs their movable eyelids their hollow ears penem intrantem feminam mammis lactantem and finally ex lege natur jure meritoque i submitted all this to my friends simeon macey and charley coffin of nantucket both messmates of mine in a certain voyage and they united in the opinion that the reasons set forth were altogether insufficient charley profanely hinted they were humbug ,MobyDick or The Whale
be it known that waiving all argument i take the good old fashioned ground that the whale is a fish and call upon holy jonah to back me this fundamental thing settled the next point is in what internal respect does the whale differ from other fish above linnus has given you those items but in brief they are these lungs and warm blood whereas all other fish are lungless and cold blooded ,MobyDick or The Whale
next how shall we define the whale by his obvious externals so as conspicuously to label him for all time to come to be short then a whale is a spouting fish with a horizontal tail there you have him however contracted that definition is the result of expanded meditation a walrus spouts much like a whale but the walrus is not a fish because he is amphibious but the last term of the definition is still more cogent as coupled with the first almost any one must have noticed that all the fish familiar to landsmen have not a flat but a vertical or upanddown tail whereas among spouting fish the tail though it may be similarly shaped invariably assumes a horizontal position ,MobyDick or The Whale
by the above definition of what a whale is i do by no means exclude from the leviathanic brotherhood any sea creature hitherto identified with the whale by the best informed nantucketers nor on the other hand link with it any fish hitherto authoritatively regarded as alien hence all the smaller spouting and horizontal tailed fish must be included in this groundplan of cetology now then come the grand divisions of the entire whale host ,MobyDick or The Whale
i am aware that down to the present time the fish styled lamatins and dugongs pigfish and sowfish of the coffins of nantucket are included by many naturalists among the whales but as these pigfish are a noisy contemptible set mostly lurking in the mouths of rivers and feeding on wet hay and especially as they do not spout i deny their credentials as whales and have presented them with their passports to quit the kingdom of cetology ,MobyDick or The Whale
folios among these i here include the following chaptersi the sperm whale ii the right whale iii the finback whale iv the humpbacked whale v the razor back whale vi the sulphur bottom whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
book i folio chapter i sperm whalethis whale among the english of old vaguely known as the trumpa whale and the physeter whale and the anvil headed whale is the present cachalot of the french and the pottsfich of the germans and the macrocephalus of the long words he is without doubt the largest inhabitant of the globe the most formidable of all whales to encounter the most majestic in aspect and lastly by far the most valuable in commerce he being the only creature from which that valuable substance spermaceti is obtained all his peculiarities will in many other places be enlarged upon it is chiefly with his name that i now have to do philologically considered it is absurd some centuries ago when the sperm whale was almost wholly unknown in his own proper individuality and when his oil was only accidentally obtained from the stranded fish in those days spermaceti it would seem was popularly supposed to be derived from a creature identical with the one then known in england as the greenland or right whale it was the idea also that this same spermaceti was that quickening humor of the greenland whale which the first syllable of the word literally expresses in those times also spermaceti was exceedingly scarce not being used for light but only as an ointment and medicament it was only to be had from the druggists as you nowadays buy an ounce of rhubarb when as i opine in the course of time the true nature of spermaceti became known its original name was still retained by the dealers no doubt to enhance its value by a notion so strangely significant of its scarcity and so the appellation must at last have come to be bestowed upon the whale from which this spermaceti was really derived ,MobyDick or The Whale
book i folio chapter ii right whalein one respect this is the most venerable of the leviathans being the one first regularly hunted by man it yields the article commonly known as whalebone or baleen and the oil specially known as whale oil an inferior article in commerce among the fishermen he is indiscriminately designated by all the following titles the whale the greenland whale the black whale the great whale the true whale the right whale there is a deal of obscurity concerning the identity of the species thus multitudinously baptised what then is the whale which i include in the second species of my folios it is the great mysticetus of the english naturalists the greenland whale of the english whalemen the baleine ordinaire of the french whalemen the growlands walfish of the swedes it is the whale which for more than two centuries past has been hunted by the dutch and english in the arctic seas it is the whale which the american fishermen have long pursued in the indian ocean on the brazil banks on the nor west coast and various other parts of the world designated by them right whale cruising grounds ,MobyDick or The Whale
some pretend to see a difference between the greenland whale of the english and the right whale of the americans but they precisely agree in all their grand features nor has there yet been presented a single determinate fact upon which to ground a radical distinction it is by endless subdivisions based upon the most inconclusive differences that some departments of natural history become so repellingly intricate the right whale will be elsewhere treated of at some length with reference to elucidating the sperm whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
book i folio chapter iii finbackunder this head i reckon a monster which by the various names of finback tallspout and longjohn has been seen almost in every sea and is commonly the whale whose distant jet is so often descried by passengers crossing the atlantic in the new york packettracks in the length he attains and in his baleen the finback resembles the right whale but is of a less portly girth and a lighter colour approaching to olive his great lips present a cablelike aspect formed by the intertwisting slanting folds of large wrinkles his grand distinguishing feature the fin from which he derives his name is often a conspicuous object this fin is some three or four feet long growing vertically from the hinder part of the back of an angular shape and with a very sharp pointed end even if not the slightest other part of the creature be visible this isolated fin will at times be seen plainly projecting from the surface when the sea is moderately calm and slightly marked with spherical ripples and this gnomonlike fin stands up and casts shadows upon the wrinkled surface it may well be supposed that the watery circle surrounding it somewhat resembles a dial with its style and wavy hourlines graved on it on that ahazdial the shadow often goes back the finback is not gregarious he seems a whalehater as some men are manhaters very shy always going solitary unexpectedly rising to the surface in the remotest and most sullen waters his straight and single lofty jet rising like a tall misanthropic spear upon a barren plain gifted with such wondrous power and velocity in swimming as to defy all present pursuit from man this leviathan seems the banished and unconquerable cain of his race bearing for his mark that style upon his back from having the baleen in his mouth the finback is sometimes included with the right whale among a theoretic species denominated whalebone whales that is whales with baleen of these so called whalebone whales there would seem to be several varieties most of which however are little known broadnosed whales and beaked whales pikeheaded whales bunched whales underjawed whales and rostrated whales are the fishermens names for a few sorts ,MobyDick or The Whale
in connection with this appellative of whalebone whales it is of great importance to mention that however such a nomenclature may be convenient in facilitating allusions to some kind of whales yet it is in vain to attempt a clear classification of the leviathan founded upon either his baleen or hump or fin or teeth notwithstanding that those marked parts or features very obviously seem better adapted to afford the basis for a regular system of cetology than any other detached bodily distinctions which the whale in his kinds presents how then the baleen hump backfin and teeth these are things whose peculiarities are indiscriminately dispersed among all sorts of whales without any regard to what may be the nature of their structure in other and more essential particulars thus the sperm whale and the humpbacked whale each has a hump but there the similitude ceases then this same humpbacked whale and the greenland whale each of these has baleen but there again the similitude ceases and it is just the same with the other parts above mentioned in various sorts of whales they form such irregular combinations or in the case of any one of them detached such an irregular isolation as utterly to defy all general methodization formed upon such a basis on this rock every one of the whalenaturalists has split ,MobyDick or The Whale
but it may possibly be conceived that in the internal parts of the whale in his anatomythere at least we shall be able to hit the right classification nay what thing for example is there in the greenland whales anatomy more striking than his baleen yet we have seen that by his baleen it is impossible correctly to classify the greenland whale and if you descend into the bowels of the various leviathans why there you will not find distinctions a fiftieth part as available to the systematizer as those external ones already enumerated what then remains nothing but to take hold of the whales bodily in their entire liberal volume and boldly sort them that way and this is the bibliographical system here adopted and it is the only one that can possibly succeed for it alone is practicable to proceed ,MobyDick or The Whale
book i folio chapter iv hump backthis whale is often seen on the northern american coast he has been frequently captured there and towed into harbor he has a great pack on him like a peddler or you might call him the elephant and castle whale at any rate the popular name for him does not sufficiently distinguish him since the sperm whale also has a hump though a smaller one his oil is not very valuable he has baleen he is the most gamesome and lighthearted of all the whales making more gay foam and white water generally than any other of them ,MobyDick or The Whale
book i folio chapter v razor backof this whale little is known but his name i have seen him at a distance off cape horn of a retiring nature he eludes both hunters and philosophers though no coward he has never yet shown any part of him but his back which rises in a long sharp ridge let him go i know little more of him nor does anybody else ,MobyDick or The Whale
book i folio chapter vi sulphur bottomanother retiring gentleman with a brimstone belly doubtless got by scraping along the tartarian tiles in some of his profounder divings he is seldom seen at least i have never seen him except in the remoter southern seas and then always at too great a distance to study his countenance he is never chased he would run away with ropewalks of line prodigies are told of him adieu sulphur bottom i can say nothing more that is true of ye nor can the oldest nantucketer ,MobyDick or The Whale
why this book of whales is not denominated the quarto is very plain because while the whales of this order though smaller than those of the former order nevertheless retain a proportionate likeness to them in figure yet the bookbinders quarto volume in its dimensioned form does not preserve the shape of the folio volume but the octavo volume does ,MobyDick or The Whale
book ii octavo chapter i grampusthough this fish whose loud sonorous breathing or rather blowing has furnished a proverb to landsmen is so well known a denizen of the deep yet is he not popularly classed among whales but possessing all the grand distinctive features of the leviathan most naturalists have recognised him for one he is of moderate octavo size varying from fifteen to twentyfive feet in length and of corresponding dimensions round the waist he swims in herds he is never regularly hunted though his oil is considerable in quantity and pretty good for light by some fishermen his approach is regarded as premonitory of the advance of the great sperm whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
book ii octavo chapter ii black fishi give the popular fishermens names for all these fish for generally they are the best where any name happens to be vague or inexpressive i shall say so and suggest another i do so now touching the black fish socalled because blackness is the rule among almost all whales so call him the hyena whale if you please his voracity is well known and from the circumstance that the inner angles of his lips are curved upwards he carries an everlasting mephistophelean grin on his face this whale averages some sixteen or eighteen feet in length he is found in almost all latitudes he has a peculiar way of showing his dorsal hooked fin in swimming which looks something like a roman nose when not more profitably employed the sperm whale hunters sometimes capture the hyena whale to keep up the supply of cheap oil for domestic employmentas some frugal housekeepers in the absence of company and quite alone by themselves burn unsavory tallow instead of odorous wax though their blubber is very thin some of these whales will yield you upwards of thirty gallons of oil ,MobyDick or The Whale
book ii octavo chapter iii narwhale that is nostril whaleanother instance of a curiously named whale so named i suppose from his peculiar horn being originally mistaken for a peaked nose the creature is some sixteen feet in length while its horn averages five feet though some exceed ten and even attain to fifteen feet strictly speaking this horn is but a lengthened tusk growing out from the jaw in a line a little depressed from the horizontal but it is only found on the sinister side which has an ill effect giving its owner something analogous to the aspect of a clumsy lefthanded man what precise purpose this ivory horn or lance answers it would be hard to say it does not seem to be used like the blade of the swordfish and billfish though some sailors tell me that the narwhale employs it for a rake in turning over the bottom of the sea for food charley coffin said it was used for an icepiercer for the narwhale rising to the surface of the polar sea and finding it sheeted with ice thrusts his horn up and so breaks through but you cannot prove either of these surmises to be correct my own opinion is that however this onesided horn may really be used by the narwhalehowever that may beit would certainly be very convenient to him for a folder in reading pamphlets the narwhale i have heard called the tusked whale the horned whale and the unicorn whale he is certainly a curious example of the unicornism to be found in almost every kingdom of animated nature from certain cloistered old authors i have gathered that this same seaunicorns horn was in ancient days regarded as the great antidote against poison and as such preparations of it brought immense prices it was also distilled to a volatile salts for fainting ladies the same way that the horns of the male deer are manufactured into hartshorn originally it was in itself accounted an object of great curiosity black letter tells me that sir martin frobisher on his return from that voyage when queen bess did gallantly wave her jewelled hand to him from a window of greenwich palace as his bold ship sailed down the thames when sir martin returned from that voyage saith black letter on bended knees he presented to her highness a prodigious long horn of the narwhale which for a long period after hung in the castle at windsor an irish author avers that the earl of leicester on bended knees did likewise present to her highness another horn pertaining to a land beast of the unicorn nature ,MobyDick or The Whale
the narwhale has a very picturesque leopardlike look being of a milkwhite ground colour dotted with round and oblong spots of black his oil is very superior clear and fine but there is little of it and he is seldom hunted he is mostly found in the circumpolar seas ,MobyDick or The Whale
book ii octavo chapter iv killerof this whale little is precisely known to the nantucketer and nothing at all to the professed naturalist from what i have seen of him at a distance i should say that he was about the bigness of a grampus he is very savagea sort of feegee fish he sometimes takes the great folio whales by the lip and hangs there like a leech till the mighty brute is worried to death the killer is never hunted i never heard what sort of oil he has exception might be taken to the name bestowed upon this whale on the ground of its indistinctness for we are all killers on land and on sea bonapartes and sharks included ,MobyDick or The Whale
book ii octavo chapter v thrasherthis gentleman is famous for his tail which he uses for a ferule in thrashing his foes he mounts the folio whales back and as he swims he works his passage by flogging him as some schoolmasters get along in the world by a similar process still less is known of the thrasher than of the killer both are outlaws even in the lawless seas ,MobyDick or The Whale
to those who have not chanced specially to study the subject it may possibly seem strange that fishes not commonly exceeding four or five feet should be marshalled among whalesa word which in the popular sense always conveys an idea of hugeness but the creatures set down above as duodecimoes are infallibly whales by the terms of my definition of what a whale isie a spouting fish with a horizontal tail ,MobyDick or The Whale
book iii duodecimo chapter  huzza porpoisethis is the common porpoise found almost all over the globe the name is of my own bestowal for there are more than one sort of porpoises and something must be done to distinguish them i call him thus because he always swims in hilarious shoals which upon the broad sea keep tossing themselves to heaven like caps in a fourthofjuly crowd their appearance is generally hailed with delight by the mariner full of fine spirits they invariably come from the breezy billows to windward they are the lads that always live before the wind they are accounted a lucky omen if you yourself can withstand three cheers at beholding these vivacious fish then heaven help ye the spirit of godly gamesomeness is not in ye a wellfed plump huzza porpoise will yield you one good gallon of good oil but the fine and delicate fluid extracted from his jaws is exceedingly valuable it is in request among jewellers and watchmakers sailors put it on their hones porpoise meat is good eating you know it may never have occurred to you that a porpoise spouts indeed his spout is so small that it is not very readily discernible but the next time you have a chance watch him and you will then see the great sperm whale himself in miniature ,MobyDick or The Whale
book iii duodecimo chapter ii algerine porpoisea pirate very savage he is only found i think in the pacific he is somewhat larger than the huzza porpoise but much of the same general make provoke him and he will buckle to a shark i have lowered for him many times but never yet saw him captured ,MobyDick or The Whale
book iii duodecimo chapter iii mealymouthed porpoisethe largest kind of porpoise and only found in the pacific so far as it is known the only english name by which he has hitherto been designated is that of the fishersrightwhale porpoise from the circumstance that he is chiefly found in the vicinity of that folio in shape he differs in some degree from the huzza porpoise being of a less rotund and jolly girth indeed he is of quite a neat and gentlemanlike figure he has no fins on his back most other porpoises have he has a lovely tail and sentimental indian eyes of a hazel hue but his mealymouth spoils all though his entire back down to his side fins is of a deep sable yet a boundary line distinct as the mark in a ships hull called the bright waist that line streaks him from stem to stern with two separate colours black above and white below the white comprises part of his head and the whole of his mouth which makes him look as if he had just escaped from a felonious visit to a mealbag a most mean and mealy aspect his oil is much like that of the common porpoise ,MobyDick or The Whale
beyond the duodecimo this system does not proceed inasmuch as the porpoise is the smallest of the whales above you have all the leviathans of note but there are a rabble of uncertain fugitive halffabulous whales which as an american whaleman i know by reputation but not personally i shall enumerate them by their forecastle appellations for possibly such a list may be valuable to future investigators who may complete what i have here but begun if any of the following whales shall hereafter be caught and marked then he can readily be incorporated into this system according to his folio octavo or duodecimo magnitudethe bottlenose whale the junk whale the puddingheaded whale the cape whale the leading whale the cannon whale the scragg whale the coppered whale the elephant whale the iceberg whale the quog whale the blue whale etc from icelandic dutch and old english authorities there might be quoted other lists of uncertain whales blessed with all manner of uncouth names but i omit them as altogether obsolete and can hardly help suspecting them for mere sounds full of leviathanism but signifying nothing ,MobyDick or The Whale
finally it was stated at the outset that this system would not be here and at once perfected you cannot but plainly see that i have kept my word but i now leave my cetological system standing thus unfinished even as the great cathedral of cologne was left with the crane still standing upon the top of the uncompleted tower for small erections may be finished by their first architects grand ones true ones ever leave the copestone to posterity god keep me from ever completing anything this whole book is but a draughtnay but the draught of a draught oh time strength cash and patience ,MobyDick or The Whale
concerning the officers of the whalecraft this seems as good a place as any to set down a little domestic peculiarity on shipboard arising from the existence of the harpooneer class of officers a class unknown of course in any other marine than the whalefleet ,MobyDick or The Whale
the large importance attached to the harpooneers vocation is evinced by the fact that originally in the old dutch fishery two centuries and more ago the command of a whale ship was not wholly lodged in the person now called the captain but was divided between him and an officer called the specksnyder literally this word means fatcutter usage however in time made it equivalent to chief harpooneer in those days the captains authority was restricted to the navigation and general management of the vessel while over the whalehunting department and all its concerns the specksnyder or chief harpooneer reigned supreme in the british greenland fishery under the corrupted title of specksioneer this old dutch official is still retained but his former dignity is sadly abridged at present he ranks simply as senior harpooneer and as such is but one of the captains more inferior subalterns nevertheless as upon the good conduct of the harpooneers the success of a whaling voyage largely depends and since in the american fishery he is not only an important officer in the boat but under certain circumstances night watches on a whaling ground the command of the ships deck is also his therefore the grand political maxim of the sea demands that he should nominally live apart from the men before the mast and be in some way distinguished as their professional superior though always by them familiarly regarded as their social equal ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the grand distinction drawn between officer and man at sea is thisthe first lives aft the last forward hence in whaleships and merchantmen alike the mates have their quarters with the captain and so too in most of the american whalers the harpooneers are lodged in the after part of the ship that is to say they take their meals in the captains cabin and sleep in a place indirectly communicating with it ,MobyDick or The Whale
though the long period of a southern whaling voyage by far the longest of all voyages now or ever made by man the peculiar perils of it and the community of interest prevailing among a company all of whom high or low depend for their profits not upon fixed wages but upon their common luck together with their common vigilance intrepidity and hard work though all these things do in some cases tend to beget a less rigorous discipline than in merchantmen generally yet never mind how much like an old mesopotamian family these whalemen may in some primitive instances live together for all that the punctilious externals at least of the quarterdeck are seldom materially relaxed and in no instance done away indeed many are the nantucket ships in which you will see the skipper parading his quarterdeck with an elated grandeur not surpassed in any military navy nay extorting almost as much outward homage as if he wore the imperial purple and not the shabbiest of pilotcloth ,MobyDick or The Whale
and though of all men the moody captain of the pequod was the least given to that sort of shallowest assumption and though the only homage he ever exacted was implicit instantaneous obedience though he required no man to remove the shoes from his feet ere stepping upon the quarterdeck and though there were times when owing to peculiar circumstances connected with events hereafter to be detailed he addressed them in unusual terms whether of condescension or in terrorem or otherwise yet even captain ahab was by no means unobservant of the paramount forms and usages of the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor perhaps will it fail to be eventually perceived that behind those forms and usages as it were he sometimes masked himself incidentally making use of them for other and more private ends than they were legitimately intended to subserve that certain sultanism of his brain which had otherwise in a good degree remained unmanifested through those forms that same sultanism became incarnate in an irresistible dictatorship for be a mans intellectual superiority what it will it can never assume the practical available supremacy over other men without the aid of some sort of external arts and entrenchments always in themselves more or less paltry and base this it is that for ever keeps gods true princes of the empire from the worlds hustings and leaves the highest honors that this air can give to those men who become famous more through their infinite inferiority to the choice hidden handful of the divine inert than through their undoubted superiority over the dead level of the mass such large virtue lurks in these small things when extreme political superstitions invest them that in some royal instances even to idiot imbecility they have imparted potency but when as in the case of nicholas the czar the ringed crown of geographical empire encircles an imperial brain then the plebeian herds crouch abased before the tremendous centralization nor will the tragic dramatist who would depict mortal indomitableness in its fullest sweep and direct swing ever forget a hint incidentally so important in his art as the one now alluded to ,MobyDick or The Whale
but ahab my captain still moves before me in all his nantucket grimness and shagginess and in this episode touching emperors and kings i must not conceal that i have only to do with a poor old whalehunter like him and therefore all outward majestical trappings and housings are denied me oh ahab what shall be grand in thee it must needs be plucked at from the skies and dived for in the deep and featured in the unbodied air ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is noon and doughboy the steward thrusting his pale loafofbread face from the cabinscuttle announces dinner to his lord and master who sitting in the lee quarterboat has just been taking an observation of the sun and is now mutely reckoning the latitude on the smooth medallionshaped tablet reserved for that daily purpose on the upper part of his ivory leg from his complete inattention to the tidings you would think that moody ahab had not heard his menial but presently catching hold of the mizen shrouds he swings himself to the deck and in an even unexhilarated voice saying dinner mr starbuck disappears into the cabin ,MobyDick or The Whale
when the last echo of his sultans step has died away and starbuck the first emir has every reason to suppose that he is seated then starbuck rouses from his quietude takes a few turns along the planks and after a grave peep into the binnacle says with some touch of pleasantness dinner mr stubb and descends the scuttle the second emir lounges about the rigging awhile and then slightly shaking the main brace to see whether it will be all right with that important rope he likewise takes up the old burden and with a rapid dinner mr flask follows after his predecessors ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the third emir now seeing himself all alone on the quarterdeck seems to feel relieved from some curious restraint for tipping all sorts of knowing winks in all sorts of directions and kicking off his shoes he strikes into a sharp but noiseless squall of a hornpipe right over the grand turks head and then by a dexterous sleight pitching his cap up into the mizentop for a shelf he goes down rollicking so far at least as he remains visible from the deck reversing all other processions by bringing up the rear with music but ere stepping into the cabin doorway below he pauses ships a new face altogether and then independent hilarious little flask enters king ahabs presence in the character of abjectus or the slave ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is not the least among the strange things bred by the intense artificialness of seausages that while in the open air of the deck some officers will upon provocation bear themselves boldly and defyingly enough towards their commander yet ten to one let those very officers the next moment go down to their customary dinner in that same commanders cabin and straightway their inoffensive not to say deprecatory and humble air towards him as he sits at the head of the table this is marvellous sometimes most comical wherefore this difference a problem perhaps not to have been belshazzar king of babylon and to have been belshazzar not haughtily but courteously therein certainly must have been some touch of mundane grandeur but he who in the rightly regal and intelligent spirit presides over his own private dinnertable of invited guests that mans unchallenged power and dominion of individual influence for the time that mans royalty of state transcends belshazzars for belshazzar was not the greatest who has but once dined his friends has tasted what it is to be csar it is a witchery of social czarship which there is no withstanding now if to this consideration you superadd the official supremacy of a shipmaster then by inference you will derive the cause of that peculiarity of sealife just mentioned ,MobyDick or The Whale
over his ivoryinlaid table ahab presided like a mute maned sealion on the white coral beach surrounded by his warlike but still deferential cubs in his own proper turn each officer waited to be served they were as little children before ahab and yet in ahab there seemed not to lurk the smallest social arrogance with one mind their intent eyes all fastened upon the old mans knife as he carved the chief dish before him i do not suppose that for the world they would have profaned that moment with the slightest observation even upon so neutral a topic as the weather no and when reaching out his knife and fork between which the slice of beef was locked ahab thereby motioned starbucks plate towards him the mate received his meat as though receiving alms and cut it tenderly and a little started if perchance the knife grazed against the plate and chewed it noiselessly and swallowed it not without circumspection for like the coronation banquet at frankfort where the german emperor profoundly dines with the seven imperial electors so these cabin meals were somehow solemn meals eaten in awful silence and yet at table old ahab forbade not conversation only he himself was dumb what a relief it was to choking stubb when a rat made a sudden racket in the hold below and poor little flask he was the youngest son and little boy of this weary family party his were the shinbones of the saline beef his would have been the drumsticks for flask to have presumed to help himself this must have seemed to him tantamount to larceny in the first degree had he helped himself at that table doubtless never more would he have been able to hold his head up in this honest world nevertheless strange to say ahab never forbade him and had flask helped himself the chances were ahab had never so much as noticed it least of all did flask presume to help himself to butter whether he thought the owners of the ship denied it to him on account of its clotting his clear sunny complexion or whether he deemed that on so long a voyage in such marketless waters butter was at a premium and therefore was not for him a subaltern however it was flask alas was a butterless man ,MobyDick or The Whale
another thing flask was the last person down at the dinner and flask is the first man up consider for hereby flasks dinner was badly jammed in point of time starbuck and stubb both had the start of him and yet they also have the privilege of lounging in the rear if stubb even who is but a peg higher than flask happens to have but a small appetite and soon shows symptoms of concluding his repast then flask must bestir himself he will not get more than three mouthfuls that day for it is against holy usage for stubb to precede flask to the deck therefore it was that flask once admitted in private that ever since he had arisen to the dignity of an officer from that moment he had never known what it was to be otherwise than hungry more or less for what he ate did not so much relieve his hunger as keep it immortal in him peace and satisfaction thought flask have for ever departed from my stomach i am an officer but how i wish i could fish a bit of oldfashioned beef in the forecastle as i used to when i was before the mast theres the fruits of promotion now theres the vanity of glory theres the insanity of life besides if it were so that any mere sailor of the pequod had a grudge against flask in flasks official capacity all that sailor had to do in order to obtain ample vengeance was to go aft at dinnertime and get a peep at flask through the cabin skylight sitting silly and dumfoundered before awful ahab ,MobyDick or The Whale
now ahab and his three mates formed what may be called the first table in the pequods cabin after their departure taking place in inverted order to their arrival the canvas cloth was cleared or rather was restored to some hurried order by the pallid steward and then the three harpooneers were bidden to the feast they being its residuary legatees they made a sort of temporary servants hall of the high and mighty cabin ,MobyDick or The Whale
in strange contrast to the hardly tolerable constraint and nameless invisible domineerings of the captains table was the entire carefree license and ease the almost frantic democracy of those inferior fellows the harpooneers while their masters the mates seemed afraid of the sound of the hinges of their own jaws the harpooneers chewed their food with such a relish that there was a report to it they dined like lords they filled their bellies like indian ships all day loading with spices such portentous appetites had queequeg and tashtego that to fill out the vacancies made by the previous repast often the pale doughboy was fain to bring on a great baron of saltjunk seemingly quarried out of the solid ox and if he were not lively about it if he did not go with a nimble hopskipandjump then tashtego had an ungentlemanly way of accelerating him by darting a fork at his back harpoonwise and once daggoo seized with a sudden humor assisted doughboys memory by snatching him up bodily and thrusting his head into a great empty wooden trencher while tashtego knife in hand began laying out the circle preliminary to scalping him he was naturally a very nervous shuddering sort of little fellow this breadfaced steward the progeny of a bankrupt baker and a hospital nurse and what with the standing spectacle of the black terrific ahab and the periodical tumultuous visitations of these three savages doughboys whole life was one continual lipquiver commonly after seeing the harpooneers furnished with all things they demanded he would escape from their clutches into his little pantry adjoining and fearfully peep out at them through the blinds of its door till all was over ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a sight to see queequeg seated over against tashtego opposing his filed teeth to the indians crosswise to them daggoo seated on the floor for a bench would have brought his hearseplumed head to the low carlines at every motion of his colossal limbs making the low cabin framework to shake as when an african elephant goes passenger in a ship but for all this the great negro was wonderfully abstemious not to say dainty it seemed hardly possible that by such comparatively small mouthfuls he could keep up the vitality diffused through so broad baronial and superb a person but doubtless this noble savage fed strong and drank deep of the abounding element of air and through his dilated nostrils snuffed in the sublime life of the worlds not by beef or by bread are giants made or nourished but queequeg he had a mortal barbaric smack of the lip in eatingan ugly sound enoughso much so that the trembling doughboy almost looked to see whether any marks of teeth lurked in his own lean arms and when he would hear tashtego singing out for him to produce himself that his bones might be picked the simplewitted steward all but shattered the crockery hanging round him in the pantry by his sudden fits of the palsy nor did the whetstone which the harpooneers carried in their pockets for their lances and other weapons and with which whetstones at dinner they would ostentatiously sharpen their knives that grating sound did not at all tend to tranquillize poor doughboy how could he forget that in his island days queequeg for one must certainly have been guilty of some murderous convivial indiscretions alas doughboy hard fares the white waiter who waits upon cannibals not a napkin should he carry on his arm but a buckler in good time though to his great delight the three saltsea warriors would rise and depart to his credulous fablemongering ears all their martial bones jingling in them at every step like moorish scimetars in scabbards ,MobyDick or The Whale
but though these barbarians dined in the cabin and nominally lived there still being anything but sedentary in their habits they were scarcely ever in it except at mealtimes and just before sleepingtime when they passed through it to their own peculiar quarters ,MobyDick or The Whale
in this one matter ahab seemed no exception to most american whale captains who as a set rather incline to the opinion that by rights the ships cabin belongs to them and that it is by courtesy alone that anybody else is at any time permitted there so that in real truth the mates and harpooneers of the pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it for when they did enter it it was something as a streetdoor enters a house turning inwards for a moment only to be turned out the next and as a permanent thing residing in the open air nor did they lose much hereby in the cabin was no companionship socially ahab was inaccessible though nominally included in the census of christendom he was still an alien to it he lived in the world as the last of the grisly bears lived in settled missouri and as when spring and summer had departed that wild logan of the woods burying himself in the hollow of a tree lived out the winter there sucking his own paws so in his inclement howling old age ahabs soul shut up in the caved trunk of his body there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom ,MobyDick or The Whale
in most american whalemen the mastheads are manned almost simultaneously with the vessels leaving her port even though she may have fifteen thousand miles and more to sail ere reaching her proper cruising ground and if after a three four or five years voyage she is drawing nigh home with anything empty in hersay an empty vial eventhen her mastheads are kept manned to the last and not till her skysailpoles sail in among the spires of the port does she altogether relinquish the hope of capturing one whale more ,MobyDick or The Whale
now as the business of standing mastheads ashore or afloat is a very ancient and interesting one let us in some measure expatiate here i take it that the earliest standers of mastheads were the old egyptians because in all my researches i find none prior to them for though their progenitors the builders of babel must doubtless by their tower have intended to rear the loftiest masthead in all asia or africa either yet ere the final truck was put to it as that great stone mast of theirs may be said to have gone by the board in the dread gale of gods wrath therefore we cannot give these babel builders priority over the egyptians and that the egyptians were a nation of masthead standers is an assertion based upon the general belief among archologists that the first pyramids were founded for astronomical purposes a theory singularly supported by the peculiar stairlike formation of all four sides of those edifices whereby with prodigious long upliftings of their legs those old astronomers were wont to mount to the apex and sing out for new stars even as the lookouts of a modern ship sing out for a sail or a whale just bearing in sight in saint stylites the famous christian hermit of old times who built him a lofty stone pillar in the desert and spent the whole latter portion of his life on its summit hoisting his food from the ground with a tackle in him we have a remarkable instance of a dauntless standerofmastheads who was not to be driven from his place by fogs or frosts rain hail or sleet but valiantly facing everything out to the last literally died at his post of modern standersofmastheads we have but a lifeless set mere stone iron and bronze men who though well capable of facing out a stiff gale are still entirely incompetent to the business of singing out upon discovering any strange sight there is napoleon who upon the top of the column of vendome stands with arms folded some one hundred and fifty feet in the air careless now who rules the decks below whether louis philippe louis blanc or louis the devil great washington too stands high aloft on his towering mainmast in baltimore and like one of hercules pillars his column marks that point of human grandeur beyond which few mortals will go admiral nelson also on a capstan of gunmetal stands his masthead in trafalgar square and ever when most obscured by that london smoke token is yet given that a hidden hero is there for where there is smoke must be fire but neither great washington nor napoleon nor nelson will answer a single hail from below however madly invoked to befriend by their counsels the distracted decks upon which they gaze however it may be surmised that their spirits penetrate through the thick haze of the future and descry what shoals and what rocks must be shunned ,MobyDick or The Whale
it may seem unwarrantable to couple in any respect the masthead standers of the land with those of the sea but that in truth it is not so is plainly evinced by an item for which obed macy the sole historian of nantucket stands accountable the worthy obed tells us that in the early times of the whale fishery ere ships were regularly launched in pursuit of the game the people of that island erected lofty spars along the seacoast to which the lookouts ascended by means of nailed cleats something as fowls go upstairs in a henhouse a few years ago this same plan was adopted by the bay whalemen of new zealand who upon descrying the game gave notice to the readymanned boats nigh the beach but this custom has now become obsolete turn we then to the one proper masthead that of a whaleship at sea the three mastheads are kept manned from sunrise to sunset the seamen taking their regular turns as at the helm and relieving each other every two hours in the serene weather of the tropics it is exceedingly pleasant the masthead nay to a dreamy meditative man it is delightful there you stand a hundred feet above the silent decks striding along the deep as if the masts were gigantic stilts while beneath you and between your legs as it were swim the hugest monsters of the sea even as ships once sailed between the boots of the famous colossus at old rhodes there you stand lost in the infinite series of the sea with nothing ruffled but the waves the tranced ship indolently rolls the drowsy trade winds blow everything resolves you into languor for the most part in this tropic whaling life a sublime uneventfulness invests you you hear no news read no gazettes extras with startling accounts of commonplaces never delude you into unnecessary excitements you hear of no domestic afflictions bankrupt securities fall of stocks are never troubled with the thought of what you shall have for dinnerfor all your meals for three years and more are snugly stowed in casks and your bill of fare is immutable ,MobyDick or The Whale
in one of those southern whalesmen on a long three or four years voyage as often happens the sum of the various hours you spend at the masthead would amount to several entire months and it is much to be deplored that the place to which you devote so considerable a portion of the whole term of your natural life should be so sadly destitute of anything approaching to a cosy inhabitiveness or adapted to breed a comfortable localness of feeling such as pertains to a bed a hammock a hearse a sentry box a pulpit a coach or any other of those small and snug contrivances in which men temporarily isolate themselves your most usual point of perch is the head of the t gallantmast where you stand upon two thin parallel sticks almost peculiar to whalemen called the t gallant crosstrees here tossed about by the sea the beginner feels about as cosy as he would standing on a bulls horns to be sure in cold weather you may carry your house aloft with you in the shape of a watchcoat but properly speaking the thickest watchcoat is no more of a house than the unclad body for as the soul is glued inside of its fleshy tabernacle and cannot freely move about in it nor even move out of it without running great risk of perishing like an ignorant pilgrim crossing the snowy alps in winter so a watchcoat is not so much of a house as it is a mere envelope or additional skin encasing you you cannot put a shelf or chest of drawers in your body and no more can you make a convenient closet of your watchcoat ,MobyDick or The Whale
concerning all this it is much to be deplored that the mastheads of a southern whale ship are unprovided with those enviable little tents or pulpits called crowsnests in which the lookouts of a greenland whaler are protected from the inclement weather of the frozen seas in the fireside narrative of captain sleet entitled a voyage among the icebergs in quest of the greenland whale and incidentally for the rediscovery of the lost icelandic colonies of old greenland in this admirable volume all standers of mastheads are furnished with a charmingly circumstantial account of the then recently invented crowsnest of the glacier which was the name of captain sleets good craft he called it the sleets crowsnest in honor of himself he being the original inventor and patentee and free from all ridiculous false delicacy and holding that if we call our own children after our own names we fathers being the original inventors and patentees so likewise should we denominate after ourselves any other apparatus we may beget in shape the sleets crowsnest is something like a large tierce or pipe it is open above however where it is furnished with a movable sidescreen to keep to windward of your head in a hard gale being fixed on the summit of the mast you ascend into it through a little traphatch in the bottom on the after side or side next the stern of the ship is a comfortable seat with a locker underneath for umbrellas comforters and coats in front is a leather rack in which to keep your speaking trumpet pipe telescope and other nautical conveniences when captain sleet in person stood his masthead in this crowsnest of his he tells us that he always had a rifle with him also fixed in the rack together with a powder flask and shot for the purpose of popping off the stray narwhales or vagrant sea unicorns infesting those waters for you cannot successfully shoot at them from the deck owing to the resistance of the water but to shoot down upon them is a very different thing now it was plainly a labor of love for captain sleet to describe as he does all the little detailed conveniences of his crowsnest but though he so enlarges upon many of these and though he treats us to a very scientific account of his experiments in this crowsnest with a small compass he kept there for the purpose of counteracting the errors resulting from what is called the local attraction of all binnacle magnets an error ascribable to the horizontal vicinity of the iron in the ships planks and in the glaciers case perhaps to there having been so many brokendown blacksmiths among her crew i say that though the captain is very discreet and scientific here yet for all his learned binnacle deviations azimuth compass observations and approximate errors he knows very well captain sleet that he was not so much immersed in those profound magnetic meditations as to fail being attracted occasionally towards that well replenished little casebottle so nicely tucked in on one side of his crows nest within easy reach of his hand though upon the whole i greatly admire and even love the brave the honest and learned captain yet i take it very ill of him that he should so utterly ignore that casebottle seeing what a faithful friend and comforter it must have been while with mittened fingers and hooded head he was studying the mathematics aloft there in that birds nest within three or four perches of the pole ,MobyDick or The Whale
but if we southern whalefishers are not so snugly housed aloft as captain sleet and his greenlandmen were yet that disadvantage is greatly counterbalanced by the widely contrasting serenity of those seductive seas in which we south fishers mostly float for one i used to lounge up the rigging very leisurely resting in the top to have a chat with queequeg or any one else off duty whom i might find there then ascending a little way further and throwing a lazy leg over the topsail yard take a preliminary view of the watery pastures and so at last mount to my ultimate destination ,MobyDick or The Whale
let me make a clean breast of it here and frankly admit that i kept but sorry guard with the problem of the universe revolving in me how could ibeing left completely to myself at such a thoughtengendering altitudehow could i but lightly hold my obligations to observe all whaleships standing orders keep your weather eye open and sing out every time ,MobyDick or The Whale
and let me in this place movingly admonish you ye shipowners of nantucket beware of enlisting in your vigilant fisheries any lad with lean brow and hollow eye given to unseasonable meditativeness and who offers to ship with the phdon instead of bowditch in his head beware of such an one i say your whales must be seen before they can be killed and this sunkeneyed young platonist will tow you ten wakes round the world and never make you one pint of sperm the richer nor are these monitions at all unneeded for nowadays the whalefishery furnishes an asylum for many romantic melancholy and absentminded young men disgusted with the carking cares of earth and seeking sentiment in tar and blubber childe harold not unfrequently perches himself upon the masthead of some luckless disappointed whaleship and in moody phrase ejaculates ,MobyDick or The Whale
very often do the captains of such ships take those absentminded young philosophers to task upbraiding them with not feeling sufficient interest in the voyage halfhinting that they are so hopelessly lost to all honorable ambition as that in their secret souls they would rather not see whales than otherwise but all in vain those young platonists have a notion that their vision is imperfect they are shortsighted what use then to strain the visual nerve they have left their operaglasses at home ,MobyDick or The Whale
why thou monkey said a harpooneer to one of these lads weve been cruising now hard upon three years and thou hast not raised a whale yet whales are scarce as hens teeth whenever thou art up here perhaps they were or perhaps there might have been shoals of them in the far horizon but lulled into such an opiumlike listlessness of vacant unconscious reverie is this absentminded youth by the blending cadence of waves with thoughts that at last he loses his identity takes the mystic ocean at his feet for the visible image of that deep blue bottomless soul pervading mankind and nature and every strange halfseen gliding beautiful thing that eludes him every dimlydiscovered uprising fin of some undiscernible form seems to him the embodiment of those elusive thoughts that only people the soul by continually flitting through it in this enchanted mood thy spirit ebbs away to whence it came becomes diffused through time and space like cranmers sprinkled pantheistic ashes forming at last a part of every shore the round globe over ,MobyDick or The Whale
there is no life in thee now except that rocking life imparted by a gently rolling ship by her borrowed from the sea by the sea from the inscrutable tides of god but while this sleep this dream is on ye move your foot or hand an inch slip your hold at all and your identity comes back in horror over descartian vortices you hover and perhaps at midday in the fairest weather with one halfthrottled shriek you drop through that transparent air into the summer sea no more to rise for ever heed it well ye pantheists ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was not a great while after the affair of the pipe that one morning shortly after breakfast ahab as was his wont ascended the cabingangway to the deck there most seacaptains usually walk at that hour as country gentlemen after the same meal take a few turns in the garden ,MobyDick or The Whale
soon his steady ivory stride was heard as to and fro he paced his old rounds upon planks so familiar to his tread that they were all over dented like geological stones with the peculiar mark of his walk did you fixedly gaze too upon that ribbed and dented brow there also you would see still stranger footprintsthe footprints of his one unsleeping everpacing thought ,MobyDick or The Whale
but on the occasion in question those dents looked deeper even as his nervous step that morning left a deeper mark and so full of his thought was ahab that at every uniform turn that he made now at the mainmast and now at the binnacle you could almost see that thought turn in him as he turned and pace in him as he paced so completely possessing him indeed that it all but seemed the inward mould of every outer movement ,MobyDick or The Whale
it drew near the close of day suddenly he came to a halt by the bulwarks and inserting his bone leg into the augerhole there and with one hand grasping a shroud he ordered starbuck to send everybody aft ,MobyDick or The Whale
when the entire ships company were assembled and with curious and not wholly unapprehensive faces were eyeing him for he looked not unlike the weather horizon when a storm is coming up ahab after rapidly glancing over the bulwarks and then darting his eyes among the crew started from his standpoint and as though not a soul were nigh him resumed his heavy turns upon the deck with bent head and halfslouched hat he continued to pace unmindful of the wondering whispering among the men till stubb cautiously whispered to flask that ahab must have summoned them there for the purpose of witnessing a pedestrian feat but this did not last long vehemently pausing he cried ,MobyDick or The Whale
more and more strangely and fiercely glad and approving grew the countenance of the old man at every shout while the mariners began to gaze curiously at each other as if marvelling how it was that they themselves became so excited at such seemingly purposeless questions ,MobyDick or The Whale
all ye mastheaders have before now heard me give orders about a white whale look ye dye see this spanish ounce of goldholding up a broad bright coin to the sunit is a sixteen dollar piece men dye see it mr starbuck hand me yon topmaul ,MobyDick or The Whale
while the mate was getting the hammer ahab without speaking was slowly rubbing the gold piece against the skirts of his jacket as if to heighten its lustre and without using any words was meanwhile lowly humming to himself producing a sound so strangely muffled and inarticulate that it seemed the mechanical humming of the wheels of his vitality in him ,MobyDick or The Whale
receiving the topmaul from starbuck he advanced towards the mainmast with the hammer uplifted in one hand exhibiting the gold with the other and with a high raised voice exclaiming whosoever of ye raises me a whiteheaded whale with a wrinkled brow and a crooked jaw whosoever of ye raises me that whiteheaded whale with three holes punctured in his starboard flukelook ye whosoever of ye raises me that same white whale he shall have this gold ounce my boys ,MobyDick or The Whale
all this while tashtego daggoo and queequeg had looked on with even more intense interest and surprise than the rest and at the mention of the wrinkled brow and crooked jaw they had started as if each was separately touched by some specific recollection ,MobyDick or The Whale
and he have one two threeoh good many iron in him hide too captain cried queequeg disjointedly all twisketee betwisk like himhim faltering hard for a word and screwing his hand round and round as though uncorking a bottlelike himhim ,MobyDick or The Whale
corkscrew cried ahab aye queequeg the harpoons lie all twisted and wrenched in him aye daggoo his spout is a big one like a whole shock of wheat and white as a pile of our nantucket wool after the great annual sheepshearing aye tashtego and he fantails like a split jib in a squall death and devils men it is moby dick ye have seenmoby dickmoby dick ,MobyDick or The Whale
captain ahab said starbuck who with stubb and flask had thus far been eyeing his superior with increasing surprise but at last seemed struck with a thought which somewhat explained all the wonder captain ahab i have heard of moby dickbut it was not moby dick that took off thy leg ,MobyDick or The Whale
who told thee that cried ahab then pausing aye starbuck aye my hearties all round it was moby dick that dismasted me moby dick that brought me to this dead stump i stand on now aye aye he shouted with a terrific loud animal sob like that of a heartstricken moose aye aye it was that accursed white whale that razed me made a poor pegging lubber of me for ever and a day then tossing both arms with measureless imprecations he shouted out aye aye and ill chase him round good hope and round the horn and round the norway maelstrom and round perditions flames before i give him up and this is what ye have shipped for men to chase that white whale on both sides of land and over all sides of earth till he spouts black blood and rolls fin out what say ye men will ye splice hands on it now i think ye do look brave ,MobyDick or The Whale
god bless ye he seemed to half sob and half shout god bless ye men steward go draw the great measure of grog but whats this long face about mr starbuck wilt thou not chase the white whale art not game for moby dick ,MobyDick or The Whale
i am game for his crooked jaw and for the jaws of death too captain ahab if it fairly comes in the way of the business we follow but i came here to hunt whales not my commanders vengeance how many barrels will thy vengeance yield thee even if thou gettest it captain ahab it will not fetch thee much in our nantucket market ,MobyDick or The Whale
nantucket market hoot but come closer starbuck thou requirest a little lower layer if moneys to be the measurer man and the accountants have computed their great countinghouse the globe by girdling it with guineas one to every three parts of an inch then let me tell thee that my vengeance will fetch a great premium here ,MobyDick or The Whale
hark ye yet againthe little lower layer all visible objects man are but as pasteboard masks but in each eventin the living act the undoubted deedthere some unknown but still reasoning thing puts forth the mouldings of its features from behind the unreasoning mask if man will strike strike through the mask how can the prisoner reach outside except by thrusting through the wall to me the white whale is that wall shoved near to me sometimes i think theres naught beyond but tis enough he tasks me he heaps me i see in him outrageous strength with an inscrutable malice sinewing it that inscrutable thing is chiefly what i hate and be the white whale agent or be the white whale principal i will wreak that hate upon him talk not to me of blasphemy man id strike the sun if it insulted me for could the sun do that then could i do the other since there is ever a sort of fair play herein jealousy presiding over all creations but not my master man is even that fair play whos over me truth hath no confines take off thine eye more intolerable than fiends glarings is a doltish stare so so thou reddenest and palest my heat has melted thee to angerglow but look ye starbuck what is said in heat that thing unsays itself there are men from whom warm words are small indignity i meant not to incense thee let it go look see yonder turkish cheeks of spotted tawnliving breathing pictures painted by the sun the pagan leopardsthe unrecking and unworshipping things that live and seek and give no reasons for the torrid life they feel the crew man the crew are they not one and all with ahab in this matter of the whale see stubb he laughs see yonder chilian he snorts to think of it stand up amid the general hurricane thy one tost sapling cannot starbuck and what is it reckon it tis but to help strike a fin no wondrous feat for starbuck what is it more from this one poor hunt then the best lance out of all nantucket surely he will not hang back when every foremasthand has clutched a whetstone ah constrainings seize thee i see the billow lifts thee speak but speakaye aye thy silence then that voices thee aside something shot from my dilated nostrils he has inhaled it in his lungs starbuck now is mine cannot oppose me now without rebellion ,MobyDick or The Whale
but in his joy at the enchanted tacit acquiescence of the mate ahab did not hear his foreboding invocation nor yet the low laugh from the hold nor yet the presaging vibrations of the winds in the cordage nor yet the hollow flap of the sails against the masts as for a moment their hearts sank in for again starbucks downcast eyes lighted up with the stubbornness of life the subterranean laugh died away the winds blew on the sails filled out the ship heaved and rolled as before ah ye admonitions and warnings why stay ye not when ye come but rather are ye predictions than warnings ye shadows yet not so much predictions from without as verifications of the foregoing things within for with little external to constrain us the innermost necessities in our being these still drive us on ,MobyDick or The Whale
receiving the brimming pewter and turning to the harpooneers he ordered them to produce their weapons then ranging them before him near the capstan with their harpoons in their hands while his three mates stood at his side with their lances and the rest of the ships company formed a circle round the group he stood for an instant searchingly eyeing every man of his crew but those wild eyes met his as the bloodshot eyes of the prairie wolves meet the eye of their leader ere he rushes on at their head in the trail of the bison but alas only to fall into the hidden snare of the indian ,MobyDick or The Whale

advance ye mates cross your lances full before me well done let me touch the axis so saying with extended arm he grasped the three level radiating lances at their crossed centre while so doing suddenly and nervously twitched them meanwhile glancing intently from starbuck to stubb from stubb to flask it seemed as though by some nameless interior volition he would fain have shocked into them the same fiery emotion accumulated within the leyden jar of his own magnetic life the three mates quailed before his strong sustained and mystic aspect stubb and flask looked sideways from him the honest eye of starbuck fell downright ,MobyDick or The Whale
in vain cried ahab but maybe tis well for did ye three but once take the fullforced shock then mine own electric thing that had perhaps expired from out me perchance too it would have dropped ye dead perchance ye need it not down lances and now ye mates i do appoint ye three cupbearers to my three pagan kinsmen thereyon three most honorable gentlemen and noblemen my valiant harpooneers disdain the task what when the great pope washes the feet of beggars using his tiara for ewer oh my sweet cardinals your own condescension that shall bend ye to it i do not order ye ye will it cut your seizings and draw the poles ye harpooneers ,MobyDick or The Whale

for some time past though at intervals only the unaccompanied secluded white whale had haunted those uncivilized seas mostly frequented by the sperm whale fishermen but not all of them knew of his existence only a few of them comparatively had knowingly seen him while the number who as yet had actually and knowingly given battle to him was small indeed for owing to the large number of whalecruisers the disorderly way they were sprinkled over the entire watery circumference many of them adventurously pushing their quest along solitary latitudes so as seldom or never for a whole twelvemonth or more on a stretch to encounter a single newstelling sail of any sort the inordinate length of each separate voyage the irregularity of the times of sailing from home all these with other circumstances direct and indirect long obstructed the spread through the whole worldwide whalingfleet of the special individualizing tidings concerning moby dick it was hardly to be doubted that several vessels reported to have encountered at such or such a time or on such or such a meridian a sperm whale of uncommon magnitude and malignity which whale after doing great mischief to his assailants had completely escaped them to some minds it was not an unfair presumption i say that the whale in question must have been no other than moby dick yet as of late the sperm whale fishery had been marked by various and not unfrequent instances of great ferocity cunning and malice in the monster attacked therefore it was that those who by accident ignorantly gave battle to moby dick such hunters perhaps for the most part were content to ascribe the peculiar terror he bred more as it were to the perils of the sperm whale fishery at large than to the individual cause in that way mostly the disastrous encounter between ahab and the whale had hitherto been popularly regarded ,MobyDick or The Whale
and as for those who previously hearing of the white whale by chance caught sight of him in the beginning of the thing they had every one of them almost as boldly and fearlessly lowered for him as for any other whale of that species but at length such calamities did ensue in these assaultsnot restricted to sprained wrists and ankles broken limbs or devouring amputationsbut fatal to the last degree of fatality those repeated disastrous repulses all accumulating and piling their terrors upon moby dick those things had gone far to shake the fortitude of many brave hunters to whom the story of the white whale had eventually come ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor did wild rumors of all sorts fail to exaggerate and still the more horrify the true histories of these deadly encounters for not only do fabulous rumors naturally grow out of the very body of all surprising terrible eventsas the smitten tree gives birth to its fungi but in maritime life far more than in that of terra firma wild rumors abound wherever there is any adequate reality for them to cling to and as the sea surpasses the land in this matter so the whale fishery surpasses every other sort of maritime life in the wonderfulness and fearfulness of the rumors which sometimes circulate there for not only are whalemen as a body unexempt from that ignorance and superstitiousness hereditary to all sailors but of all sailors they are by all odds the most directly brought into contact with whatever is appallingly astonishing in the sea face to face they not only eye its greatest marvels but hand to jaw give battle to them alone in such remotest waters that though you sailed a thousand miles and passed a thousand shores you would not come to any chiseled hearthstone or aught hospitable beneath that part of the sun in such latitudes and longitudes pursuing too such a calling as he does the whaleman is wrapped by influences all tending to make his fancy pregnant with many a mighty birth ,MobyDick or The Whale
no wonder then that ever gathering volume from the mere transit over the widest watery spaces the outblown rumors of the white whale did in the end incorporate with themselves all manner of morbid hints and halfformed ftal suggestions of supernatural agencies which eventually invested moby dick with new terrors unborrowed from anything that visibly appears so that in many cases such a panic did he finally strike that few who by those rumors at least had heard of the white whale few of those hunters were willing to encounter the perils of his jaw ,MobyDick or The Whale
but there were still other and more vital practical influences at work not even at the present day has the original prestige of the sperm whale as fearfully distinguished from all other species of the leviathan died out of the minds of the whalemen as a body there are those this day among them who though intelligent and courageous enough in offering battle to the greenland or right whale would perhapseither from professional inexperience or incompetency or timidity decline a contest with the sperm whale at any rate there are plenty of whalemen especially among those whaling nations not sailing under the american flag who have never hostilely encountered the sperm whale but whose sole knowledge of the leviathan is restricted to the ignoble monster primitively pursued in the north seated on their hatches these men will hearken with a childish fireside interest and awe to the wild strange tales of southern whaling nor is the preeminent tremendousness of the great sperm whale anywhere more feelingly comprehended than on board of those prows which stem him ,MobyDick or The Whale
and as if the now tested reality of his might had in former legendary times thrown its shadow before it we find some book naturalistsolassen and povelsondeclaring the sperm whale not only to be a consternation to every other creature in the sea but also to be so incredibly ferocious as continually to be athirst for human blood nor even down to so late a time as cuviers were these or almost similar impressions effaced for in his natural history the baron himself affirms that at sight of the sperm whale all fish sharks included are struck with the most lively terrors and often in the precipitancy of their flight dash themselves against the rocks with such violence as to cause instantaneous death and however the general experiences in the fishery may amend such reports as these yet in their full terribleness even to the bloodthirsty item of povelson the superstitious belief in them is in some vicissitudes of their vocation revived in the minds of the hunters ,MobyDick or The Whale
so that overawed by the rumors and portents concerning him not a few of the fishermen recalled in reference to moby dick the earlier days of the sperm whale fishery when it was oftentimes hard to induce long practised right whalemen to embark in the perils of this new and daring warfare such men protesting that although other leviathans might be hopefully pursued yet to chase and point lance at such an apparition as the sperm whale was not for mortal man that to attempt it would be inevitably to be torn into a quick eternity on this head there are some remarkable documents that may be consulted ,MobyDick or The Whale
nevertheless some there were who even in the face of these things were ready to give chase to moby dick and a still greater number who chancing only to hear of him distantly and vaguely without the specific details of any certain calamity and without superstitious accompaniments were sufficiently hardy not to flee from the battle if offered ,MobyDick or The Whale
one of the wild suggestions referred to as at last coming to be linked with the white whale in the minds of the superstitiously inclined was the unearthly conceit that moby dick was ubiquitous that he had actually been encountered in opposite latitudes at one and the same instant of time ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor credulous as such minds must have been was this conceit altogether without some faint show of superstitious probability for as the secrets of the currents in the seas have never yet been divulged even to the most erudite research so the hidden ways of the sperm whale when beneath the surface remain in great part unaccountable to his pursuers and from time to time have originated the most curious and contradictory speculations regarding them especially concerning the mystic modes whereby after sounding to a great depth he transports himself with such vast swiftness to the most widely distant points ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is a thing well known to both american and english whaleships and as well a thing placed upon authoritative record years ago by scoresby that some whales have been captured far north in the pacific in whose bodies have been found the barbs of harpoons darted in the greenland seas nor is it to be gainsaid that in some of these instances it has been declared that the interval of time between the two assaults could not have exceeded very many days hence by inference it has been believed by some whalemen that the nor west passage so long a problem to man was never a problem to the whale so that here in the real living experience of living men the prodigies related in old times of the inland strello mountain in portugal near whose top there was said to be a lake in which the wrecks of ships floated up to the surface and that still more wonderful story of the arethusa fountain near syracuse whose waters were believed to have come from the holy land by an underground passage these fabulous narrations are almost fully equalled by the realities of the whalemen ,MobyDick or The Whale
forced into familiarity then with such prodigies as these and knowing that after repeated intrepid assaults the white whale had escaped alive it cannot be much matter of surprise that some whalemen should go still further in their superstitions declaring moby dick not only ubiquitous but immortal for immortality is but ubiquity in time that though groves of spears should be planted in his flanks he would still swim away unharmed or if indeed he should ever be made to spout thick blood such a sight would be but a ghastly deception for again in unensanguined billows hundreds of leagues away his unsullied jet would once more be seen ,MobyDick or The Whale
but even stripped of these supernatural surmisings there was enough in the earthly make and incontestable character of the monster to strike the imagination with unwonted power for it was not so much his uncommon bulk that so much distinguished him from other sperm whales but as was elsewhere thrown outa peculiar snowwhite wrinkled forehead and a high pyramidical white hump these were his prominent features the tokens whereby even in the limitless uncharted seas he revealed his identity at a long distance to those who knew him ,MobyDick or The Whale
the rest of his body was so streaked and spotted and marbled with the same shrouded hue that in the end he had gained his distinctive appellation of the white whale a name indeed literally justified by his vivid aspect when seen gliding at high noon through a dark blue sea leaving a milkyway wake of creamy foam all spangled with golden gleamings ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor was it his unwonted magnitude nor his remarkable hue nor yet his deformed lower jaw that so much invested the whale with natural terror as that unexampled intelligent malignity which according to specific accounts he had over and over again evinced in his assaults more than all his treacherous retreats struck more of dismay than perhaps aught else for when swimming before his exulting pursuers with every apparent symptom of alarm he had several times been known to turn round suddenly and bearing down upon them either stave their boats to splinters or drive them back in consternation to their ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
already several fatalities had attended his chase but though similar disasters however little bruited ashore were by no means unusual in the fishery yet in most instances such seemed the white whales infernal aforethought of ferocity that every dismembering or death that he caused was not wholly regarded as having been inflicted by an unintelligent agent ,MobyDick or The Whale
judge then to what pitches of inflamed distracted fury the minds of his more desperate hunters were impelled when amid the chips of chewed boats and the sinking limbs of torn comrades they swam out of the white curds of the whales direful wrath into the serene exasperating sunlight that smiled on as if at a birth or a bridal ,MobyDick or The Whale
his three boats stove around him and oars and men both whirling in the eddies one captain seizing the lineknife from his broken prow had dashed at the whale as an arkansas duellist at his foe blindly seeking with a six inch blade to reach the fathomdeep life of the whale that captain was ahab and then it was that suddenly sweeping his sickleshaped lower jaw beneath him moby dick had reaped away ahabs leg as a mower a blade of grass in the field no turbaned turk no hired venetian or malay could have smote him with more seeming malice small reason was there to doubt then that ever since that almost fatal encounter ahab had cherished a wild vindictiveness against the whale all the more fell for that in his frantic morbidness he at last came to identify with him not only all his bodily woes but all his intellectual and spiritual exasperations the white whale swam before him as the monomaniac incarnation of all those malicious agencies which some deep men feel eating in them till they are left living on with half a heart and half a lung that intangible malignity which has been from the beginning to whose dominion even the modern christians ascribe onehalf of the worlds which the ancient ophites of the east reverenced in their statue devilahab did not fall down and worship it like them but deliriously transferring its idea to the abhorred white whale he pitted himself all mutilated against it all that most maddens and torments all that stirs up the lees of things all truth with malice in it all that cracks the sinews and cakes the brain all the subtle demonisms of life and thought all evil to crazy ahab were visibly personified and made practically assailable in moby dick he piled upon the whales white hump the sum of all the general rage and hate felt by his whole race from adam down and then as if his chest had been a mortar he burst his hot hearts shell upon it ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is not probable that this monomania in him took its instant rise at the precise time of his bodily dismemberment then in darting at the monster knife in hand he had but given loose to a sudden passionate corporal animosity and when he received the stroke that tore him he probably but felt the agonizing bodily laceration but nothing more yet when by this collision forced to turn towards home and for long months of days and weeks ahab and anguish lay stretched together in one hammock rounding in mid winter that dreary howling patagonian cape then it was that his torn body and gashed soul bled into one another and so interfusing made him mad that it was only then on the homeward voyage after the encounter that the final monomania seized him seems all but certain from the fact that at intervals during the passage he was a raving lunatic and though unlimbed of a leg yet such vital strength yet lurked in his egyptian chest and was moreover intensified by his delirium that his mates were forced to lace him fast even there as he sailed raving in his hammock in a straitjacket he swung to the mad rockings of the gales and when running into more sufferable latitudes the ship with mild stunsails spread floated across the tranquil tropics and to all appearances the old mans delirium seemed left behind him with the cape horn swells and he came forth from his dark den into the blessed light and air even then when he bore that firm collected front however pale and issued his calm orders once again and his mates thanked god the direful madness was now gone even then ahab in his hidden self raved on human madness is oftentimes a cunning and most feline thing when you think it fled it may have but become transfigured into some still subtler form ahabs full lunacy subsided not but deepeningly contracted like the unabated hudson when that noble northman flows narrowly but unfathomably through the highland gorge but as in his narrowflowing monomania not one jot of ahabs broad madness had been left behind so in that broad madness not one jot of his great natural intellect had perished that before living agent now became the living instrument if such a furious trope may stand his special lunacy stormed his general sanity and carried it and turned all its concentred cannon upon its own mad mark so that far from having lost his strength ahab to that one end did now possess a thousand fold more potency than ever he had sanely brought to bear upon any one reasonable object ,MobyDick or The Whale
this is much yet ahabs larger darker deeper part remains unhinted but vain to popularize profundities and all truth is profound winding far down from within the very heart of this spiked hotel de cluny where we here standhowever grand and wonderful now quit itand take your way ye nobler sadder souls to those vast roman halls of thermes where far beneath the fantastic towers of mans upper earth his root of grandeur his whole awful essence sits in bearded state an antique buried beneath antiquities and throned on torsoes so with a broken throne the great gods mock that captive king so like a caryatid he patient sits upholding on his frozen brow the piled entablatures of ages wind ye down there ye prouder sadder souls question that proud sad king a family likeness aye he did beget ye ye young exiled royalties and from your grim sire only will the old statesecret come ,MobyDick or The Whale
now in his heart ahab had some glimpse of this namely all my means are sane my motive and my object mad yet without power to kill or change or shun the fact he likewise knew that to mankind he did long dissemble in some sort did still but that thing of his dissembling was only subject to his perceptibility not to his will determinate nevertheless so well did he succeed in that dissembling that when with ivory leg he stepped ashore at last no nantucketer thought him otherwise than but naturally grieved and that to the quick with the terrible casualty which had overtaken him ,MobyDick or The Whale
the report of his undeniable delirium at sea was likewise popularly ascribed to a kindred cause and so too all the added moodiness which always afterwards to the very day of sailing in the pequod on the present voyage sat brooding on his brow nor is it so very unlikely that far from distrusting his fitness for another whaling voyage on account of such dark symptoms the calculating people of that prudent isle were inclined to harbor the conceit that for those very reasons he was all the better qualified and set on edge for a pursuit so full of rage and wildness as the bloody hunt of whales gnawed within and scorched without with the infixed unrelenting fangs of some incurable idea such an one could he be found would seem the very man to dart his iron and lift his lance against the most appalling of all brutes or if for any reason thought to be corporeally incapacitated for that yet such an one would seem superlatively competent to cheer and howl on his underlings to the attack but be all this as it may certain it is that with the mad secret of his unabated rage bolted up and keyed in him ahab had purposely sailed upon the present voyage with the one only and allengrossing object of hunting the white whale had any one of his old acquaintances on shore but half dreamed of what was lurking in him then how soon would their aghast and righteous souls have wrenched the ship from such a fiendish man they were bent on profitable cruises the profit to be counted down in dollars from the mint he was intent on an audacious immitigable and supernatural revenge ,MobyDick or The Whale
here then was this greyheaded ungodly old man chasing with curses a jobs whale round the world at the head of a crew too chiefly made up of mongrel renegades and castaways and cannibalsmorally enfeebled also by the incompetence of mere unaided virtue or rightmindedness in starbuck the invulnerable jollity of indifference and recklessness in stubb and the pervading mediocrity in flask such a crew so officered seemed specially picked and packed by some infernal fatality to help him to his monomaniac revenge how it was that they so aboundingly responded to the old mans ireby what evil magic their souls were possessed that at times his hate seemed almost theirs the white whale as much their insufferable foe as his how all this came to bewhat the white whale was to them or how to their unconscious understandings also in some dim unsuspected way he might have seemed the gliding great demon of the seas of lifeall this to explain would be to dive deeper than ishmael can go the subterranean miner that works in us all how can one tell whither leads his shaft by the ever shifting muffled sound of his pick who does not feel the irresistible arm drag what skiff in tow of a seventyfour can stand still for one i gave myself up to the abandonment of the time and the place but while yet all arush to encounter the whale could see naught in that brute but the deadliest ill ,MobyDick or The Whale
aside from those more obvious considerations touching moby dick which could not but occasionally awaken in any mans soul some alarm there was another thought or rather vague nameless horror concerning him which at times by its intensity completely overpowered all the rest and yet so mystical and well nigh ineffable was it that i almost despair of putting it in a comprehensible form it was the whiteness of the whale that above all things appalled me but how can i hope to explain myself here and yet in some dim random way explain myself i must else all these chapters might be naught ,MobyDick or The Whale
though in many natural objects whiteness refiningly enhances beauty as if imparting some special virtue of its own as in marbles japonicas and pearls and though various nations have in some way recognised a certain royal preeminence in this hue even the barbaric grand old kings of pegu placing the title lord of the white elephants above all their other magniloquent ascriptions of dominion and the modern kings of siam unfurling the same snowwhite quadruped in the royal standard and the hanoverian flag bearing the one figure of a snowwhite charger and the great austrian empire csarian heir to overlording rome having for the imperial colour the same imperial hue and though this preeminence in it applies to the human race itself giving the white man ideal mastership over every dusky tribe and though besides all this whiteness has been even made significant of gladness for among the romans a white stone marked a joyful day and though in other mortal sympathies and symbolizings this same hue is made the emblem of many touching noble thingsthe innocence of brides the benignity of age though among the red men of america the giving of the white belt of wampum was the deepest pledge of honor though in many climes whiteness typifies the majesty of justice in the ermine of the judge and contributes to the daily state of kings and queens drawn by milkwhite steeds though even in the higher mysteries of the most august religions it has been made the symbol of the divine spotlessness and power by the persian fire worshippers the white forked flame being held the holiest on the altar and in the greek mythologies great jove himself being made incarnate in a snowwhite bull and though to the noble iroquois the midwinter sacrifice of the sacred white dog was by far the holiest festival of their theology that spotless faithful creature being held the purest envoy they could send to the great spirit with the annual tidings of their own fidelity and though directly from the latin word for white all christian priests derive the name of one part of their sacred vesture the alb or tunic worn beneath the cassock and though among the holy pomps of the romish faith white is specially employed in the celebration of the passion of our lord though in the vision of st john white robes are given to the redeemed and the fourandtwenty elders stand clothed in white before the great white throne and the holy one that sitteth there white like wool yet for all these accumulated associations with whatever is sweet and honorable and sublime there yet lurks an elusive something in the innermost idea of this hue which strikes more of panic to the soul than that redness which affrights in blood ,MobyDick or The Whale
this elusive quality it is which causes the thought of whiteness when divorced from more kindly associations and coupled with any object terrible in itself to heighten that terror to the furthest bounds witness the white bear of the poles and the white shark of the tropics what but their smooth flaky whiteness makes them the transcendent horrors they are that ghastly whiteness it is which imparts such an abhorrent mildness even more loathsome than terrific to the dumb gloating of their aspect so that not the fiercefanged tiger in his heraldic coat can so stagger courage as the whiteshrouded bear or shark ,MobyDick or The Whale
with reference to the polar bear it may possibly be urged by him who would fain go still deeper into this matter that it is not the whiteness separately regarded which heightens the intolerable hideousness of that brute for analysed that heightened hideousness it might be said only rises from the circumstance that the irresponsible ferociousness of the creature stands invested in the fleece of celestial innocence and love and hence by bringing together two such opposite emotions in our minds the polar bear frightens us with so unnatural a contrast but even assuming all this to be true yet were it not for the whiteness you would not have that intensified terror ,MobyDick or The Whale
as for the white shark the white gliding ghostliness of repose in that creature when beheld in his ordinary moods strangely tallies with the same quality in the polar quadruped this peculiarity is most vividly hit by the french in the name they bestow upon that fish the romish mass for the dead begins with requiem eternam eternal rest whence requiem denominating the mass itself and any other funeral music now in allusion to the white silent stillness of death in this shark and the mild deadliness of his habits the french call him requin ,MobyDick or The Whale
bethink thee of the albatross whence come those clouds of spiritual wonderment and pale dread in which that white phantom sails in all imaginations not coleridge first threw that spell but gods great unflattering laureate nature ,MobyDick or The Whale
i remember the first albatross i ever saw it was during a prolonged gale in waters hard upon the antarctic seas from my forenoon watch below i ascended to the overclouded deck and there dashed upon the main hatches i saw a regal feathery thing of unspotted whiteness and with a hooked roman bill sublime at intervals it arched forth its vast archangel wings as if to embrace some holy ark wondrous flutterings and throbbings shook it though bodily unharmed it uttered cries as some kings ghost in supernatural distress through its inexpressible strange eyes methought i peeped to secrets which took hold of god as abraham before the angels i bowed myself the white thing was so white its wings so wide and in those for ever exiled waters i had lost the miserable warping memories of traditions and of towns long i gazed at that prodigy of plumage i cannot tell can only hint the things that darted through me then but at last i awoke and turning asked a sailor what bird was this a goney he replied goney never had heard that name before is it conceivable that this glorious thing is utterly unknown to men ashore never but some time after i learned that goney was some seamans name for albatross so that by no possibility could coleridges wild rhyme have had aught to do with those mystical impressions which were mine when i saw that bird upon our deck for neither had i then read the rhyme nor knew the bird to be an albatross yet in saying this i do but indirectly burnish a little brighter the noble merit of the poem and the poet ,MobyDick or The Whale
i assert then that in the wondrous bodily whiteness of the bird chiefly lurks the secret of the spell a truth the more evinced in this that by a solecism of terms there are birds called grey albatrosses and these i have frequently seen but never with such emotions as when i beheld the antarctic fowl ,MobyDick or The Whale
but how had the mystic thing been caught whisper it not and i will tell with a treacherous hook and line as the fowl floated on the sea at last the captain made a postman of it tying a lettered leathern tally round its neck with the ships time and place and then letting it escape but i doubt not that leathern tally meant for man was taken off in heaven when the white fowl flew to join the wingfolding the invoking and adoring cherubim ,MobyDick or The Whale
most famous in our western annals and indian traditions is that of the white steed of the prairies a magnificent milkwhite charger largeeyed smallheaded bluffchested and with the dignity of a thousand monarchs in his lofty overscorning carriage he was the elected xerxes of vast herds of wild horses whose pastures in those days were only fenced by the rocky mountains and the alleghanies at their flaming head he westward trooped it like that chosen star which every evening leads on the hosts of light the flashing cascade of his mane the curving comet of his tail invested him with housings more resplendent than gold and silverbeaters could have furnished him a most imperial and archangelical apparition of that unfallen western world which to the eyes of the old trappers and hunters revived the glories of those primeval times when adam walked majestic as a god bluffbrowed and fearless as this mighty steed whether marching amid his aides and marshals in the van of countless cohorts that endlessly streamed it over the plains like an ohio or whether with his circumambient subjects browsing all around at the horizon the white steed gallopingly reviewed them with warm nostrils reddening through his cool milkiness in whatever aspect he presented himself always to the bravest indians he was the object of trembling reverence and awe nor can it be questioned from what stands on legendary record of this noble horse that it was his spiritual whiteness chiefly which so clothed him with divineness and that this divineness had that in it which though commanding worship at the same time enforced a certain nameless terror ,MobyDick or The Whale
what is it that in the albino man so peculiarly repels and often shocks the eye as that sometimes he is loathed by his own kith and kin it is that whiteness which invests him a thing expressed by the name he bears the albino is as well made as other menhas no substantive deformityand yet this mere aspect of allpervading whiteness makes him more strangely hideous than the ugliest abortion why should this be so ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor in quite other aspects does nature in her least palpable but not the less malicious agencies fail to enlist among her forces this crowning attribute of the terrible from its snowy aspect the gauntleted ghost of the southern seas has been denominated the white squall nor in some historic instances has the art of human malice omitted so potent an auxiliary how wildly it heightens the effect of that passage in froissart when masked in the snowy symbol of their faction the desperate white hoods of ghent murder their bailiff in the marketplace ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor in some things does the common hereditary experience of all mankind fail to bear witness to the supernaturalism of this hue it cannot well be doubted that the one visible quality in the aspect of the dead which most appals the gazer is the marble pallor lingering there as if indeed that pallor were as much like the badge of consternation in the other world as of mortal trepidation here and from that pallor of the dead we borrow the expressive hue of the shroud in which we wrap them nor even in our superstitions do we fail to throw the same snowy mantle round our phantoms all ghosts rising in a milkwhite fogyea while these terrors seize us let us add that even the king of terrors when personified by the evangelist rides on his pallid horse ,MobyDick or The Whale
but though without dissent this point be fixed how is mortal man to account for it to analyse it would seem impossible can we then by the citation of some of those instances wherein this thing of whitenessthough for the time either wholly or in great part stripped of all direct associations calculated to impart to it aught fearful but nevertheless is found to exert over us the same sorcery however modifiedcan we thus hope to light upon some chance clue to conduct us to the hidden cause we seek ,MobyDick or The Whale
let us try but in a matter like this subtlety appeals to subtlety and without imagination no man can follow another into these halls and though doubtless some at least of the imaginative impressions about to be presented may have been shared by most men yet few perhaps were entirely conscious of them at the time and therefore may not be able to recall them now ,MobyDick or The Whale
why to the man of untutored ideality who happens to be but loosely acquainted with the peculiar character of the day does the bare mention of whitsuntide marshal in the fancy such long dreary speechless processions of slowpacing pilgrims downcast and hooded with newfallen snow or to the unread unsophisticated protestant of the middle american states why does the passing mention of a white friar or a white nun evoke such an eyeless statue in the soul ,MobyDick or The Whale
or what is there apart from the traditions of dungeoned warriors and kings which will not wholly account for it that makes the white tower of london tell so much more strongly on the imagination of an untravelled american than those other storied structures its neighborsthe byward tower or even the bloody and those sublimer towers the white mountains of new hampshire whence in peculiar moods comes that gigantic ghostliness over the soul at the bare mention of that name while the thought of virginias blue ridge is full of a soft dewy distant dreaminess or why irrespective of all latitudes and longitudes does the name of the white sea exert such a spectralness over the fancy while that of the yellow sea lulls us with mortal thoughts of long lacquered mild afternoons on the waves followed by the gaudiest and yet sleepiest of sunsets or to choose a wholly unsubstantial instance purely addressed to the fancy why in reading the old fairy tales of central europe does the tall pale man of the hartz forests whose changeless pallor unrustlingly glides through the green of the groveswhy is this phantom more terrible than all the whooping imps of the blocksburg ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor is it altogether the remembrance of her cathedraltoppling earthquakes nor the stampedoes of her frantic seas nor the tearlessness of arid skies that never rain nor the sight of her wide field of leaning spires wrenched copestones and crosses all adroop like canted yards of anchored fleets and her suburban avenues of housewalls lying over upon each other as a tossed pack of cardsit is not these things alone which make tearless lima the strangest saddest city thou canst see for lima has taken the white veil and there is a higher horror in this whiteness of her woe old as pizarro this whiteness keeps her ruins for ever new admits not the cheerful greenness of complete decay spreads over her broken ramparts the rigid pallor of an apoplexy that fixes its own distortions ,MobyDick or The Whale
i know that to the common apprehension this phenomenon of whiteness is not confessed to be the prime agent in exaggerating the terror of objects otherwise terrible nor to the unimaginative mind is there aught of terror in those appearances whose awfulness to another mind almost solely consists in this one phenomenon especially when exhibited under any form at all approaching to muteness or universality what i mean by these two statements may perhaps be respectively elucidated by the following examples ,MobyDick or The Whale
first the mariner when drawing nigh the coasts of foreign lands if by night he hear the roar of breakers starts to vigilance and feels just enough of trepidation to sharpen all his faculties but under precisely similar circumstances let him be called from his hammock to view his ship sailing through a midnight sea of milky whitenessas if from encircling headlands shoals of combed white bears were swimming round him then he feels a silent superstitious dread the shrouded phantom of the whitened waters is horrible to him as a real ghost in vain the lead assures him he is still off soundings heart and helm they both go down he never rests till blue water is under him again yet where is the mariner who will tell thee sir it was not so much the fear of striking hidden rocks as the fear of that hideous whiteness that so stirred me ,MobyDick or The Whale
second to the native indian of peru the continual sight of the snowhowdahed andes conveys naught of dread except perhaps in the mere fancying of the eternal frosted desolateness reigning at such vast altitudes and the natural conceit of what a fearfulness it would be to lose oneself in such inhuman solitudes much the same is it with the backwoodsman of the west who with comparative indifference views an unbounded prairie sheeted with driven snow no shadow of tree or twig to break the fixed trance of whiteness not so the sailor beholding the scenery of the antarctic seas where at times by some infernal trick of legerdemain in the powers of frost and air he shivering and half shipwrecked instead of rainbows speaking hope and solace to his misery views what seems a boundless churchyard grinning upon him with its lean ice monuments and splintered crosses ,MobyDick or The Whale
tell me why this strong young colt foaled in some peaceful valley of vermont far removed from all beasts of preywhy is it that upon the sunniest day if you but shake a fresh buffalo robe behind him so that he cannot even see it but only smells its wild animal muskinesswhy will he start snort and with bursting eyes paw the ground in phrensies of affright there is no remembrance in him of any gorings of wild creatures in his green northern home so that the strange muskiness he smells cannot recall to him anything associated with the experience of former perils for what knows he this new england colt of the black bisons of distant oregon ,MobyDick or The Whale
no but here thou beholdest even in a dumb brute the instinct of the knowledge of the demonism in the world though thousands of miles from oregon still when he smells that savage musk the rending goring bison herds are as present as to the deserted wild foal of the prairies which this instant they may be trampling into dust ,MobyDick or The Whale
thus then the muffled rollings of a milky sea the bleak rustlings of the festooned frosts of mountains the desolate shiftings of the windrowed snows of prairies all these to ishmael are as the shaking of that buffalo robe to the frightened colt ,MobyDick or The Whale
though neither knows where lie the nameless things of which the mystic sign gives forth such hints yet with me as with the colt somewhere those things must exist though in many of its aspects this visible world seems formed in love the invisible spheres were formed in fright ,MobyDick or The Whale
but not yet have we solved the incantation of this whiteness and learned why it appeals with such power to the soul and more strange and far more portentouswhy as we have seen it is at once the most meaning symbol of spiritual things nay the very veil of the christians deity and yet should be as it is the intensifying agent in things the most appalling to mankind ,MobyDick or The Whale
is it that by its indefiniteness it shadows forth the heartless voids and immensities of the universe and thus stabs us from behind with the thought of annihilation when beholding the white depths of the milky way or is it that as in essence whiteness is not so much a colour as the visible absence of colour and at the same time the concrete of all colours is it for these reasons that there is such a dumb blankness full of meaning in a wide landscape of snowsa colourless allcolour of atheism from which we shrink and when we consider that other theory of the natural philosophers that all other earthly huesevery stately or lovely emblazoningthe sweet tinges of sunset skies and woods yea and the gilded velvets of butterflies and the butterfly cheeks of young girls all these are but subtile deceits not actually inherent in substances but only laid on from without so that all deified nature absolutely paints like the harlot whose allurements cover nothing but the charnelhouse within and when we proceed further and consider that the mystical cosmetic which produces every one of her hues the great principle of light for ever remains white or colorless in itself and if operating without medium upon matter would touch all objects even tulips and roses with its own blank tingepondering all this the palsied universe lies before us a leper and like wilful travellers in lapland who refuse to wear coloured and colouring glasses upon their eyes so the wretched infidel gazes himself blind at the monumental white shroud that wraps all the prospect around him and of all these things the albino whale was the symbol wonder ye then at the fiery hunt ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was the middlewatch a fair moonlight the seamen were standing in a cordon extending from one of the freshwater butts in the waist to the scuttlebutt near the taffrail in this manner they passed the buckets to fill the scuttlebutt standing for the most part on the hallowed precincts of the quarterdeck they were careful not to speak or rustle their feet from hand to hand the buckets went in the deepest silence only broken by the occasional flap of a sail and the steady hum of the unceasingly advancing keel ,MobyDick or The Whale
grin away well see what turns up hark ye cabaco there is somebody down in the afterhold that has not yet been seen on deck and i suspect our old mogul knows something of it too i heard stubb tell flask one morning watch that there was something of that sort in the wind ,MobyDick or The Whale
had you followed captain ahab down into his cabin after the squall that took place on the night succeeding that wild ratification of his purpose with his crew you would have seen him go to a locker in the transom and bringing out a large wrinkled roll of yellowish sea charts spread them before him on his screweddown table then seating himself before it you would have seen him intently study the various lines and shadings which there met his eye and with slow but steady pencil trace additional courses over spaces that before were blank at intervals he would refer to piles of old logbooks beside him wherein were set down the seasons and places in which on various former voyages of various ships sperm whales had been captured or seen ,MobyDick or The Whale
while thus employed the heavy pewter lamp suspended in chains over his head continually rocked with the motion of the ship and for ever threw shifting gleams and shadows of lines upon his wrinkled brow till it almost seemed that while he himself was marking out lines and courses on the wrinkled charts some invisible pencil was also tracing lines and courses upon the deeply marked chart of his forehead ,MobyDick or The Whale
but it was not this night in particular that in the solitude of his cabin ahab thus pondered over his charts almost every night they were brought out almost every night some pencil marks were effaced and others were substituted for with the charts of all four oceans before him ahab was threading a maze of currents and eddies with a view to the more certain accomplishment of that monomaniac thought of his soul ,MobyDick or The Whale
now to any one not fully acquainted with the ways of the leviathans it might seem an absurdly hopeless task thus to seek out one solitary creature in the unhooped oceans of this planet but not so did it seem to ahab who knew the sets of all tides and currents and thereby calculating the driftings of the sperm whales food and also calling to mind the regular ascertained seasons for hunting him in particular latitudes could arrive at reasonable surmises almost approaching to certainties concerning the timeliest day to be upon this or that ground in search of his prey ,MobyDick or The Whale
so assured indeed is the fact concerning the periodicalness of the sperm whales resorting to given waters that many hunters believe that could he be closely observed and studied throughout the world were the logs for one voyage of the entire whale fleet carefully collated then the migrations of the sperm whale would be found to correspond in invariability to those of the herringshoals or the flights of swallows on this hint attempts have been made to construct elaborate migratory charts of the sperm whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
since the above was written the statement is happily borne out by an official circular issued by lieutenant maury of the national observatory washington april th  by that circular it appears that precisely such a chart is in course of completion and portions of it are presented in the circular this chart divides the ocean into districts of five degrees of latitude by five degrees of longitude perpendicularly through each of which districts are twelve columns for the twelve months and horizontally through each of which districts are three lines one to show the number of days that have been spent in each month in every district and the two others to show the number of days in which whales sperm or right have been seen ,MobyDick or The Whale
besides when making a passage from one feedingground to another the sperm whales guided by some infallible instinctsay rather secret intelligence from the deitymostly swim in veins as they are called continuing their way along a given oceanline with such undeviating exactitude that no ship ever sailed her course by any chart with one tithe of such marvellous precision though in these cases the direction taken by any one whale be straight as a surveyors parallel and though the line of advance be strictly confined to its own unavoidable straight wake yet the arbitrary vein in which at these times he is said to swim generally embraces some few miles in width more or less as the vein is presumed to expand or contract but never exceeds the visual sweep from the whaleships mastheads when circumspectly gliding along this magic zone the sum is that at particular seasons within that breadth and along that path migrating whales may with great confidence be looked for ,MobyDick or The Whale
and hence not only at substantiated times upon well known separate feedinggrounds could ahab hope to encounter his prey but in crossing the widest expanses of water between those grounds he could by his art so place and time himself on his way as even then not to be wholly without prospect of a meeting ,MobyDick or The Whale
there was a circumstance which at first sight seemed to entangle his delirious but still methodical scheme but not so in the reality perhaps though the gregarious sperm whales have their regular seasons for particular grounds yet in general you cannot conclude that the herds which haunted such and such a latitude or longitude this year say will turn out to be identically the same with those that were found there the preceding season though there are peculiar and unquestionable instances where the contrary of this has proved true in general the same remark only within a less wide limit applies to the solitaries and hermits among the matured aged sperm whales so that though moby dick had in a former year been seen for example on what is called the seychelle ground in the indian ocean or volcano bay on the japanese coast yet it did not follow that were the pequod to visit either of those spots at any subsequent corresponding season she would infallibly encounter him there so too with some other feeding grounds where he had at times revealed himself but all these seemed only his casual stoppingplaces and oceaninns so to speak not his places of prolonged abode and where ahabs chances of accomplishing his object have hitherto been spoken of allusion has only been made to whatever wayside antecedent extra prospects were his ere a particular set time or place were attained when all possibilities would become probabilities and as ahab fondly thought every possibility the next thing to a certainty that particular set time and place were conjoined in the one technical phrasethe seasonontheline for there and then for several consecutive years moby dick had been periodically descried lingering in those waters for awhile as the sun in its annual round loiters for a predicted interval in any one sign of the zodiac there it was too that most of the deadly encounters with the white whale had taken place there the waves were storied with his deeds there also was that tragic spot where the monomaniac old man had found the awful motive to his vengeance but in the cautious comprehensiveness and unloitering vigilance with which ahab threw his brooding soul into this unfaltering hunt he would not permit himself to rest all his hopes upon the one crowning fact above mentioned however flattering it might be to those hopes nor in the sleeplessness of his vow could he so tranquillize his unquiet heart as to postpone all intervening quest ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the pequod had sailed from nantucket at the very beginning of the seasonontheline no possible endeavor then could enable her commander to make the great passage southwards double cape horn and then running down sixty degrees of latitude arrive in the equatorial pacific in time to cruise there therefore he must wait for the next ensuing season yet the premature hour of the pequods sailing had perhaps been correctly selected by ahab with a view to this very complexion of things because an interval of three hundred and sixtyfive days and nights was before him an interval which instead of impatiently enduring ashore he would spend in a miscellaneous hunt if by chance the white whale spending his vacation in seas far remote from his periodical feedinggrounds should turn up his wrinkled brow off the persian gulf or in the bengal bay or china seas or in any other waters haunted by his race so that monsoons pampas norwesters harmattans trades any wind but the levanter and simoon might blow moby dick into the devious zigzag worldcircle of the pequods circumnavigating wake ,MobyDick or The Whale
but granting all this yet regarded discreetly and coolly seems it not but a mad idea this that in the broad boundless ocean one solitary whale even if encountered should be thought capable of individual recognition from his hunter even as a whitebearded mufti in the thronged thoroughfares of constantinople yes for the peculiar snowwhite brow of moby dick and his snowwhite hump could not but be unmistakable and have i not tallied the whale ahab would mutter to himself as after poring over his charts till long after midnight he would throw himself back in reveriestallied him and shall he escape his broad fins are bored and scalloped out like a lost sheeps ear and here his mad mind would run on in a breathless race till a weariness and faintness of pondering came over him and in the open air of the deck he would seek to recover his strength ah god what trances of torments does that man endure who is consumed with one unachieved revengeful desire he sleeps with clenched hands and wakes with his own bloody nails in his palms ,MobyDick or The Whale
often when forced from his hammock by exhausting and intolerably vivid dreams of the night which resuming his own intense thoughts through the day carried them on amid a clashing of phrensies and whirled them round and round and round in his blazing brain till the very throbbing of his lifespot became insufferable anguish and when as was sometimes the case these spiritual throes in him heaved his being up from its base and a chasm seemed opening in him from which forked flames and lightnings shot up and accursed fiends beckoned him to leap down among them when this hell in himself yawned beneath him a wild cry would be heard through the ship and with glaring eyes ahab would burst from his state room as though escaping from a bed that was on fire yet these perhaps instead of being the unsuppressable symptoms of some latent weakness or fright at his own resolve were but the plainest tokens of its intensity for at such times crazy ahab the scheming unappeasedly steadfast hunter of the white whale this ahab that had gone to his hammock was not the agent that so caused him to burst from it in horror again the latter was the eternal living principle or soul in him and in sleep being for the time dissociated from the characterizing mind which at other times employed it for its outer vehicle or agent it spontaneously sought escape from the scorching contiguity of the frantic thing of which for the time it was no longer an integral but as the mind does not exist unless leagued with the soul therefore it must have been that in ahabs case yielding up all his thoughts and fancies to his one supreme purpose that purpose by its own sheer inveteracy of will forced itself against gods and devils into a kind of selfassumed independent being of its own nay could grimly live and burn while the common vitality to which it was conjoined fled horrorstricken from the unbidden and unfathered birth therefore the tormented spirit that glared out of bodily eyes when what seemed ahab rushed from his room was for the time but a vacated thing a formless somnambulistic being a ray of living light to be sure but without an object to colour and therefore a blankness in itself god help thee old man thy thoughts have created a creature in thee and he whose intense thinking thus makes him a prometheus a vulture feeds upon that heart for ever that vulture the very creature he creates ,MobyDick or The Whale
so far as what there may be of a narrative in this book and indeed as indirectly touching one or two very interesting and curious particulars in the habits of sperm whales the foregoing chapter in its earlier part is as important a one as will be found in this volume but the leading matter of it requires to be still further and more familiarly enlarged upon in order to be adequately understood and moreover to take away any incredulity which a profound ignorance of the entire subject may induce in some minds as to the natural verity of the main points of this affair ,MobyDick or The Whale
i care not to perform this part of my task methodically but shall be content to produce the desired impression by separate citations of items practically or reliably known to me as a whaleman and from these citations i take itthe conclusion aimed at will naturally follow of itself ,MobyDick or The Whale
first i have personally known three instances where a whale after receiving a harpoon has effected a complete escape and after an interval in one instance of three years has been again struck by the same hand and slain when the two irons both marked by the same private cypher have been taken from the body in the instance where three years intervened between the flinging of the two harpoons and i think it may have been something more than that the man who darted them happening in the interval to go in a trading ship on a voyage to africa went ashore there joined a discovery party and penetrated far into the interior where he travelled for a period of nearly two years often endangered by serpents savages tigers poisonous miasmas with all the other common perils incident to wandering in the heart of unknown regions meanwhile the whale he had struck must also have been on its travels no doubt it had thrice circumnavigated the globe brushing with its flanks all the coasts of africa but to no purpose this man and this whale again came together and the one vanquished the other i say i myself have known three instances similar to this that is in two of them i saw the whales struck and upon the second attack saw the two irons with the respective marks cut in them afterwards taken from the dead fish in the threeyear instance it so fell out that i was in the boat both times first and last and the last time distinctly recognised a peculiar sort of huge mole under the whales eye which i had observed there three years previous i say three years but i am pretty sure it was more than that here are three instances then which i personally know the truth of but i have heard of many other instances from persons whose veracity in the matter there is no good ground to impeach ,MobyDick or The Whale
secondly it is well known in the sperm whale fishery however ignorant the world ashore may be of it that there have been several memorable historical instances where a particular whale in the ocean has been at distant times and places popularly cognisable why such a whale became thus marked was not altogether and originally owing to his bodily peculiarities as distinguished from other whales for however peculiar in that respect any chance whale may be they soon put an end to his peculiarities by killing him and boiling him down into a peculiarly valuable oil no the reason was this that from the fatal experiences of the fishery there hung a terrible prestige of perilousness about such a whale as there did about rinaldo rinaldini insomuch that most fishermen were content to recognise him by merely touching their tarpaulins when he would be discovered lounging by them on the sea without seeking to cultivate a more intimate acquaintance like some poor devils ashore that happen to know an irascible great man they make distant unobtrusive salutations to him in the street lest if they pursued the acquaintance further they might receive a summary thump for their presumption ,MobyDick or The Whale
but not only did each of these famous whales enjoy great individual celebritynay you may call it an oceanwide renown not only was he famous in life and now is immortal in forecastle stories after death but he was admitted into all the rights privileges and distinctions of a name had as much a name indeed as cambyses or csar was it not so o timor tom thou famed leviathan scarred like an iceberg who so long didst lurk in the oriental straits of that name whose spout was oft seen from the palmy beach of ombay was it not so o new zealand jack thou terror of all cruisers that crossed their wakes in the vicinity of the tattoo land was it not so o morquan king of japan whose lofty jet they say at times assumed the semblance of a snowwhite cross against the sky was it not so o don miguel thou chilian whale marked like an old tortoise with mystic hieroglyphics upon the back in plain prose here are four whales as well known to the students of cetacean history as marius or sylla to the classic scholar ,MobyDick or The Whale
but this is not all new zealand tom and don miguel after at various times creating great havoc among the boats of different vessels were finally gone in quest of systematically hunted out chased and killed by valiant whaling captains who heaved up their anchors with that express object as much in view as in setting out through the narragansett woods captain butler of old had it in his mind to capture that notorious murderous savage annawon the headmost warrior of the indian king philip ,MobyDick or The Whale
i do not know where i can find a better place than just here to make mention of one or two other things which to me seem important as in printed form establishing in all respects the reasonableness of the whole story of the white whale more especially the catastrophe for this is one of those disheartening instances where truth requires full as much bolstering as error so ignorant are most landsmen of some of the plainest and most palpable wonders of the world that without some hints touching the plain facts historical and otherwise of the fishery they might scout at moby dick as a monstrous fable or still worse and more detestable a hideous and intolerable allegory ,MobyDick or The Whale
first though most men have some vague flitting ideas of the general perils of the grand fishery yet they have nothing like a fixed vivid conception of those perils and the frequency with which they recur one reason perhaps is that not one in fifty of the actual disasters and deaths by casualties in the fishery ever finds a public record at home however transient and immediately forgotten that record do you suppose that that poor fellow there who this moment perhaps caught by the whaleline off the coast of new guinea is being carried down to the bottom of the sea by the sounding leviathando you suppose that that poor fellows name will appear in the newspaper obituary you will read tomorrow at your breakfast no because the mails are very irregular between here and new guinea in fact did you ever hear what might be called regular news direct or indirect from new guinea yet i tell you that upon one particular voyage which i made to the pacific among many others we spoke thirty different ships every one of which had had a death by a whale some of them more than one and three that had each lost a boats crew for gods sake be economical with your lamps and candles not a gallon you burn but at least one drop of mans blood was spilled for it ,MobyDick or The Whale
secondly people ashore have indeed some indefinite idea that a whale is an enormous creature of enormous power but i have ever found that when narrating to them some specific example of this twofold enormousness they have significantly complimented me upon my facetiousness when i declare upon my soul i had no more idea of being facetious than moses when he wrote the history of the plagues of egypt ,MobyDick or The Whale
but fortunately the special point i here seek can be established upon testimony entirely independent of my own that point is this the sperm whale is in some cases sufficiently powerful knowing and judiciously malicious as with direct aforethought to stave in utterly destroy and sink a large ship and what is more the sperm whale has done it ,MobyDick or The Whale
first in the year  the ship essex captain pollard of nantucket was cruising in the pacific ocean one day she saw spouts lowered her boats and gave chase to a shoal of sperm whales ere long several of the whales were wounded when suddenly a very large whale escaping from the boats issued from the shoal and bore directly down upon the ship dashing his forehead against her hull he so stove her in that in less than ten minutes she settled down and fell over not a surviving plank of her has been seen since after the severest exposure part of the crew reached the land in their boats being returned home at last captain pollard once more sailed for the pacific in command of another ship but the gods shipwrecked him again upon unknown rocks and breakers for the second time his ship was utterly lost and forthwith forswearing the sea he has never tempted it since at this day captain pollard is a resident of nantucket i have seen owen chace who was chief mate of the essex at the time of the tragedy i have read his plain and faithful narrative i have conversed with his son and all this within a few miles of the scene of the catastrophe ,MobyDick or The Whale
the following are extracts from chaces narrative every fact seemed to warrant me in concluding that it was anything but chance which directed his operations he made two several attacks upon the ship at a short interval between them both of which according to their direction were calculated to do us the most injury by being made ahead and thereby combining the speed of the two objects for the shock to effect which the exact manuvres which he made were necessary his aspect was most horrible and such as indicated resentment and fury he came directly from the shoal which we had just before entered and in which we had struck three of his companions as if fired with revenge for their sufferings again at all events the whole circumstances taken together all happening before my own eyes and producing at the time impressions in my mind of decided calculating mischief on the part of the whale many of which impressions i cannot now recall induce me to be satisfied that i am correct in my opinion ,MobyDick or The Whale
here are his reflections some time after quitting the ship during a black night in an open boat when almost despairing of reaching any hospitable shore the dark ocean and swelling waters were nothing the fears of being swallowed up by some dreadful tempest or dashed upon hidden rocks with all the other ordinary subjects of fearful contemplation seemed scarcely entitled to a moments thought the dismal looking wreck and the horrid aspect and revenge of the whale wholly engrossed my reflections until day again made its appearance ,MobyDick or The Whale
secondly the ship union also of nantucket was in the year  totally lost off the azores by a similar onset but the authentic particulars of this catastrophe i have never chanced to encounter though from the whale hunters i have now and then heard casual allusions to it ,MobyDick or The Whale
thirdly some eighteen or twenty years ago commodore j then commanding an american sloopofwar of the first class happened to be dining with a party of whaling captains on board a nantucket ship in the harbor of oahu sandwich islands conversation turning upon whales the commodore was pleased to be sceptical touching the amazing strength ascribed to them by the professional gentlemen present he peremptorily denied for example that any whale could so smite his stout sloopofwar as to cause her to leak so much as a thimbleful very good but there is more coming some weeks after the commodore set sail in this impregnable craft for valparaiso but he was stopped on the way by a portly sperm whale that begged a few moments confidential business with him that business consisted in fetching the commodores craft such a thwack that with all his pumps going he made straight for the nearest port to heave down and repair i am not superstitious but i consider the commodores interview with that whale as providential was not saul of tarsus converted from unbelief by a similar fright i tell you the sperm whale will stand no nonsense ,MobyDick or The Whale
i will now refer you to langsdorffs voyages for a little circumstance in point peculiarly interesting to the writer hereof langsdorff you must know by the way was attached to the russian admiral krusensterns famous discovery expedition in the beginning of the present century captain langsdorff thus begins his seventeenth chapter ,MobyDick or The Whale
by the thirteenth of may our ship was ready to sail and the next day we were out in the open sea on our way to ochotsh the weather was very clear and fine but so intolerably cold that we were obliged to keep on our fur clothing for some days we had very little wind it was not till the nineteenth that a brisk gale from the northwest sprang up an uncommon large whale the body of which was larger than the ship itself lay almost at the surface of the water but was not perceived by any one on board till the moment when the ship which was in full sail was almost upon him so that it was impossible to prevent its striking against him we were thus placed in the most imminent danger as this gigantic creature setting up its back raised the ship three feet at least out of the water the masts reeled and the sails fell altogether while we who were below all sprang instantly upon the deck concluding that we had struck upon some rock instead of this we saw the monster sailing off with the utmost gravity and solemnity captain dwolf applied immediately to the pumps to examine whether or not the vessel had received any damage from the shock but we found that very happily it had escaped entirely uninjured ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the captain dwolf here alluded to as commanding the ship in question is a new englander who after a long life of unusual adventures as a seacaptain this day resides in the village of dorchester near boston i have the honor of being a nephew of his i have particularly questioned him concerning this passage in langsdorff he substantiates every word the ship however was by no means a large one a russian craft built on the siberian coast and purchased by my uncle after bartering away the vessel in which he sailed from home ,MobyDick or The Whale
in that up and down manly book of oldfashioned adventure so full too of honest wondersthe voyage of lionel wafer one of ancient dampiers old chumsi found a little matter set down so like that just quoted from langsdorff that i cannot forbear inserting it here for a corroborative example if such be needed ,MobyDick or The Whale
lionel it seems was on his way to john ferdinando as he calls the modern juan fernandes in our way thither he says about four oclock in the morning when we were about one hundred and fifty leagues from the main of america our ship felt a terrible shock which put our men in such consternation that they could hardly tell where they were or what to think but every one began to prepare for death and indeed the shock was so sudden and violent that we took it for granted the ship had struck against a rock but when the amazement was a little over we cast the lead and sounded but found no ground      the suddenness of the shock made the guns leap in their carriages and several of the men were shaken out of their hammocks captain davis who lay with his head on a gun was thrown out of his cabin lionel then goes on to impute the shock to an earthquake and seems to substantiate the imputation by stating that a great earthquake somewhere about that time did actually do great mischief along the spanish land but i should not much wonder if in the darkness of that early hour of the morning the shock was after all caused by an unseen whale vertically bumping the hull from beneath ,MobyDick or The Whale
i might proceed with several more examples one way or another known to me of the great power and malice at times of the sperm whale in more than one instance he has been known not only to chase the assailing boats back to their ships but to pursue the ship itself and long withstand all the lances hurled at him from its decks the english ship pusie hall can tell a story on that head and as for his strength let me say that there have been examples where the lines attached to a running sperm whale have in a calm been transferred to the ship and secured there the whale towing her great hull through the water as a horse walks off with a cart again it is very often observed that if the sperm whale once struck is allowed time to rally he then acts not so often with blind rage as with wilful deliberate designs of destruction to his pursuers nor is it without conveying some eloquent indication of his character that upon being attacked he will frequently open his mouth and retain it in that dread expansion for several consecutive minutes but i must be content with only one more and a concluding illustration a remarkable and most significant one by which you will not fail to see that not only is the most marvellous event in this book corroborated by plain facts of the present day but that these marvels like all marvels are mere repetitions of the ages so that for the millionth time we say amen with solomonverily there is nothing new under the sun ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the sixth christian century lived procopius a christian magistrate of constantinople in the days when justinian was emperor and belisarius general as many know he wrote the history of his own times a work every way of uncommon value by the best authorities he has always been considered a most trustworthy and unexaggerating historian except in some one or two particulars not at all affecting the matter presently to be mentioned ,MobyDick or The Whale
now in this history of his procopius mentions that during the term of his prefecture at constantinople a great seamonster was captured in the neighboring propontis or sea of marmora after having destroyed vessels at intervals in those waters for a period of more than fifty years a fact thus set down in substantial history cannot easily be gainsaid nor is there any reason it should be of what precise species this seamonster was is not mentioned but as he destroyed ships as well as for other reasons he must have been a whale and i am strongly inclined to think a sperm whale and i will tell you why for a long time i fancied that the sperm whale had been always unknown in the mediterranean and the deep waters connecting with it even now i am certain that those seas are not and perhaps never can be in the present constitution of things a place for his habitual gregarious resort but further investigations have recently proved to me that in modern times there have been isolated instances of the presence of the sperm whale in the mediterranean i am told on good authority that on the barbary coast a commodore davis of the british navy found the skeleton of a sperm whale now as a vessel of war readily passes through the dardanelles hence a sperm whale could by the same route pass out of the mediterranean into the propontis ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the propontis as far as i can learn none of that peculiar substance called brit is to be found the aliment of the right whale but i have every reason to believe that the food of the sperm whalesquid or cuttlefishlurks at the bottom of that sea because large creatures but by no means the largest of that sort have been found at its surface if then you properly put these statements together and reason upon them a bit you will clearly perceive that according to all human reasoning procopiuss seamonster that for half a century stove the ships of a roman emperor must in all probability have been a sperm whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
though consumed with the hot fire of his purpose ahab in all his thoughts and actions ever had in view the ultimate capture of moby dick though he seemed ready to sacrifice all mortal interests to that one passion nevertheless it may have been that he was by nature and long habituation far too wedded to a fiery whalemans ways altogether to abandon the collateral prosecution of the voyage or at least if this were otherwise there were not wanting other motives much more influential with him it would be refining too much perhaps even considering his monomania to hint that his vindictiveness towards the white whale might have possibly extended itself in some degree to all sperm whales and that the more monsters he slew by so much the more he multiplied the chances that each subsequently encountered whale would prove to be the hated one he hunted but if such an hypothesis be indeed exceptionable there were still additional considerations which though not so strictly according with the wildness of his ruling passion yet were by no means incapable of swaying him ,MobyDick or The Whale
to accomplish his object ahab must use tools and of all tools used in the shadow of the moon men are most apt to get out of order he knew for example that however magnetic his ascendency in some respects was over starbuck yet that ascendency did not cover the complete spiritual man any more than mere corporeal superiority involves intellectual mastership for to the purely spiritual the intellectual but stand in a sort of corporeal relation starbucks body and starbucks coerced will were ahabs so long as ahab kept his magnet at starbucks brain still he knew that for all this the chief mate in his soul abhorred his captains quest and could he would joyfully disintegrate himself from it or even frustrate it it might be that a long interval would elapse ere the white whale was seen during that long interval starbuck would ever be apt to fall into open relapses of rebellion against his captains leadership unless some ordinary prudential circumstantial influences were brought to bear upon him not only that but the subtle insanity of ahab respecting moby dick was noways more significantly manifested than in his superlative sense and shrewdness in foreseeing that for the present the hunt should in some way be stripped of that strange imaginative impiousness which naturally invested it that the full terror of the voyage must be kept withdrawn into the obscure background for few mens courage is proof against protracted meditation unrelieved by action that when they stood their long night watches his officers and men must have some nearer things to think of than moby dick for however eagerly and impetuously the savage crew had hailed the announcement of his quest yet all sailors of all sorts are more or less capricious and unreliablethey live in the varying outer weather and they inhale its ficklenessand when retained for any object remote and blank in the pursuit however promissory of life and passion in the end it is above all things requisite that temporary interests and employments should intervene and hold them healthily suspended for the final dash ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor was ahab unmindful of another thing in times of strong emotion mankind disdain all base considerations but such times are evanescent the permanent constitutional condition of the manufactured man thought ahab is sordidness granting that the white whale fully incites the hearts of this my savage crew and playing round their savageness even breeds a certain generous knighterrantism in them still while for the love of it they give chase to moby dick they must also have food for their more common daily appetites for even the high lifted and chivalric crusaders of old times were not content to traverse two thousand miles of land to fight for their holy sepulchre without committing burglaries picking pockets and gaining other pious perquisites by the way had they been strictly held to their one final and romantic objectthat final and romantic object too many would have turned from in disgust i will not strip these men thought ahab of all hopes of cashaye cash they may scorn cash now but let some months go by and no perspective promise of it to them and then this same quiescent cash all at once mutinying in them this same cash would soon cashier ahab ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor was there wanting still another precautionary motive more related to ahab personally having impulsively it is probable and perhaps somewhat prematurely revealed the prime but private purpose of the pequods voyage ahab was now entirely conscious that in so doing he had indirectly laid himself open to the unanswerable charge of usurpation and with perfect impunity both moral and legal his crew if so disposed and to that end competent could refuse all further obedience to him and even violently wrest from him the command from even the barely hinted imputation of usurpation and the possible consequences of such a suppressed impression gaining ground ahab must of course have been most anxious to protect himself that protection could only consist in his own predominating brain and heart and hand backed by a heedful closely calculating attention to every minute atmospheric influence which it was possible for his crew to be subjected to ,MobyDick or The Whale
for all these reasons then and others perhaps too analytic to be verbally developed here ahab plainly saw that he must still in a good degree continue true to the natural nominal purpose of the pequods voyage observe all customary usages and not only that but force himself to evince all his well known passionate interest in the general pursuit of his profession ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a cloudy sultry afternoon the seamen were lazily lounging about the decks or vacantly gazing over into the leadcoloured waters queequeg and i were mildly employed weaving what is called a swordmat for an additional lashing to our boat so still and subdued and yet somehow preluding was all the scene and such an incantation of reverie lurked in the air that each silent sailor seemed resolved into his own invisible self ,MobyDick or The Whale
i was the attendant or page of queequeg while busy at the mat as i kept passing and repassing the filling or woof of marline between the long yarns of the warp using my own hand for the shuttle and as queequeg standing sideways ever and anon slid his heavy oaken sword between the threads and idly looking off upon the water carelessly and unthinkingly drove home every yarn i say so strange a dreaminess did there then reign all over the ship and all over the sea only broken by the intermitting dull sound of the sword that it seemed as if this were the loom of time and i myself were a shuttle mechanically weaving and weaving away at the fates there lay the fixed threads of the warp subject to but one single ever returning unchanging vibration and that vibration merely enough to admit of the crosswise interblending of other threads with its own this warp seemed necessity and here thought i with my own hand i ply my own shuttle and weave my own destiny into these unalterable threads meantime queequegs impulsive indifferent sword sometimes hitting the woof slantingly or crookedly or strongly or weakly as the case might be and by this difference in the concluding blow producing a corresponding contrast in the final aspect of the completed fabric this savages sword thought i which thus finally shapes and fashions both warp and woof this easy indifferent sword must be chanceaye chance free will and necessitynowise incompatibleall interweavingly working together the straight warp of necessity not to be swerved from its ultimate courseits every alternating vibration indeed only tending to that free will still free to ply her shuttle between given threads and chance though restrained in its play within the right lines of necessity and sideways in its motions directed by free will though thus prescribed to by both chance by turns rules either and has the last featuring blow at events ,MobyDick or The Whale
thus we were weaving and weaving away when i started at a sound so strange long drawn and musically wild and unearthly that the ball of free will dropped from my hand and i stood gazing up at the clouds whence that voice dropped like a wing high aloft in the crosstrees was that mad gayheader tashtego his body was reaching eagerly forward his hand stretched out like a wand and at brief sudden intervals he continued his cries to be sure the same sound was that very moment perhaps being heard all over the seas from hundreds of whalemens lookouts perched as high in the air but from few of those lungs could that accustomed old cry have derived such a marvellous cadence as from tashtego the indians ,MobyDick or The Whale
as he stood hovering over you half suspended in air so wildly and eagerly peering towards the horizon you would have thought him some prophet or seer beholding the shadows of fate and by those wild cries announcing their coming ,MobyDick or The Whale
the ship was now kept away from the wind and she went gently rolling before it tashtego reporting that the whales had gone down heading to leeward we confidently looked to see them again directly in advance of our bows for that singular craft at times evinced by the sperm whale when sounding with his head in one direction he nevertheless while concealed beneath the surface mills round and swiftly swims off in the opposite quarterthis deceitfulness of his could not now be in action for there was no reason to suppose that the fish seen by tashtego had been in any way alarmed or indeed knew at all of our vicinity one of the men selected for shipkeepersthat is those not appointed to the boats by this time relieved the indian at the mainmast head the sailors at the fore and mizzen had come down the line tubs were fixed in their places the cranes were thrust out the mainyard was backed and the three boats swung over the sea like three samphire baskets over high cliffs outside of the bulwarks their eager crews with one hand clung to the rail while one foot was expectantly poised on the gunwale so look the long line of manofwars men about to throw themselves on board an enemys ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
the phantoms for so they then seemed were flitting on the other side of the deck and with a noiseless celerity were casting loose the tackles and bands of the boat which swung there this boat had always been deemed one of the spare boats though technically called the captains on account of its hanging from the starboard quarter the figure that now stood by its bows was tall and swart with one white tooth evilly protruding from its steellike lips a rumpled chinese jacket of black cotton funereally invested him with wide black trowsers of the same dark stuff but strangely crowning this ebonness was a glistening white plaited turban the living hair braided and coiled round and round upon his head less swart in aspect the companions of this figure were of that vivid tigeryellow complexion peculiar to some of the aboriginal natives of the manillasa race notorious for a certain diabolism of subtilty and by some honest white mariners supposed to be the paid spies and secret confidential agents on the water of the devil their lord whose countingroom they suppose to be elsewhere ,MobyDick or The Whale
such was the thunder of his voice that spite of their amazement the men sprang over the rail the sheaves whirled round in the blocks with a wallow the three boats dropped into the sea while with a dexterous offhanded daring unknown in any other vocation the sailors goatlike leaped down the rolling ships side into the tossed boats below ,MobyDick or The Whale
hardly had they pulled out from under the ships lee when a fourth keel coming from the windward side pulled round under the stern and showed the five strangers rowing ahab who standing erect in the stern loudly hailed starbuck stubb and flask to spread themselves widely so as to cover a large expanse of water but with all their eyes again riveted upon the swart fedallah and his crew the inmates of the other boats obeyed not the command ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye aye sir cheerily cried little kingpost sweeping round his great steering oar lay back addressing his crew theretherethere again there she blows right ahead boyslay back ,MobyDick or The Whale
pull pull my fine heartsalive pull my children pull my little ones drawlingly and soothingly sighed stubb to his crew some of whom still showed signs of uneasiness why dont you break your backbones my boys what is it you stare at those chaps in yonder boat tut they are only five more hands come to help usnever mind from wherethe more the merrier pull then do pull never mind the brimstonedevils are good fellows enough so so there you are now thats the stroke for a thousand pounds thats the stroke to sweep the stakes hurrah for the gold cup of sperm oil my heroes three cheers menall hearts alive easy easy dont be in a hurrydont be in a hurry why dont you snap your oars you rascals bite something you dogs so so so thensoftly softly thats itthats it long and strong give way there give way the devil fetch ye ye ragamuffin rapscallions ye are all asleep stop snoring ye sleepers and pull pull will ye pull cant ye pull wont ye why in the name of gudgeons and gingercakes dont ye pullpull and break something pull and start your eyes out here whipping out the sharp knife from his girdle every mothers son of ye draw his knife and pull with the blade between his teeth thats itthats it now ye do something that looks like it my steelbits start herstart her my silverspoons start her marlingspikes ,MobyDick or The Whale
stubbs exordium to his crew is given here at large because he had rather a peculiar way of talking to them in general and especially in inculcating the religion of rowing but you must not suppose from this specimen of his sermonizings that he ever flew into downright passions with his congregation not at all and therein consisted his chief peculiarity he would say the most terrific things to his crew in a tone so strangely compounded of fun and fury and the fury seemed so calculated merely as a spice to the fun that no oarsman could hear such queer invocations without pulling for dear life and yet pulling for the mere joke of the thing besides he all the time looked so easy and indolent himself so loungingly managed his steeringoar and so broadly gapedopenmouthed at timesthat the mere sight of such a yawning commander by sheer force of contrast acted like a charm upon the crew then again stubb was one of those odd sort of humorists whose jollity is sometimes so curiously ambiguous as to put all inferiors on their guard in the matter of obeying them ,MobyDick or The Whale
smuggled on board somehow before the ship sailed strong strong boys in a whisper to his crew then speaking out loud again a sad business mr stubb seethe her seethe her my lads but never mind mr stubb all for the best let all your crew pull strong come what will spring my men spring theres hogsheads of sperm ahead mr stubb and thats what ye came for pull my boys sperm sperms the play this at least is duty duty and profit hand in hand ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye aye i thought as much soliloquized stubb when the boats diverged as soon as i clapt eye on em i thought so aye and thats what he went into the after hold for so often as doughboy long suspected they were hidden down there the white whales at the bottom of it well well so be it cant be helped all right give way men it aint the white whale today give way ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the advent of these outlandish strangers at such a critical instant as the lowering of the boats from the deck this had not unreasonably awakened a sort of superstitious amazement in some of the ships company but archys fancied discovery having some time previous got abroad among them though indeed not credited then this had in some small measure prepared them for the event it took off the extreme edge of their wonder and so what with all this and stubbs confident way of accounting for their appearance they were for the time freed from superstitious surmisings though the affair still left abundant room for all manner of wild conjectures as to dark ahabs precise agency in the matter from the beginning for me i silently recalled the mysterious shadows i had seen creeping on board the pequod during the dim nantucket dawn as well as the enigmatical hintings of the unaccountable elijah ,MobyDick or The Whale
meantime ahab out of hearing of his officers having sided the furthest to windward was still ranging ahead of the other boats a circumstance bespeaking how potent a crew was pulling him those tiger yellow creatures of his seemed all steel and whalebone like five triphammers they rose and fell with regular strokes of strength which periodically started the boat along the water like a horizontal burst boiler out of a mississippi steamer as for fedallah who was seen pulling the harpooneer oar he had thrown aside his black jacket and displayed his naked chest with the whole part of his body above the gunwale clearly cut against the alternating depressions of the watery horizon while at the other end of the boat ahab with one arm like a fencers thrown half backward into the air as if to counterbalance any tendency to trip ahab was seen steadily managing his steering oar as in a thousand boat lowerings ere the white whale had torn him all at once the outstretched arm gave a peculiar motion and then remained fixed while the boats five oars were seen simultaneously peaked boat and crew sat motionless on the sea instantly the three spread boats in the rear paused on their way the whales had irregularly settled bodily down into the blue thus giving no distantly discernible token of the movement though from his closer vicinity ahab had observed it ,MobyDick or The Whale
nimbly springing up on the triangular raised box in the bow the savage stood erect there and with intensely eager eyes gazed off towards the spot where the chase had last been descried likewise upon the extreme stern of the boat where it was also triangularly platformed level with the gunwale starbuck himself was seen coolly and adroitly balancing himself to the jerking tossings of his chip of a craft and silently eyeing the vast blue eye of the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
not very far distant flasks boat was also lying breathlessly still its commander recklessly standing upon the top of the loggerhead a stout sort of post rooted in the keel and rising some two feet above the level of the stern platform it is used for catching turns with the whale line its top is not more spacious than the palm of a mans hand and standing upon such a base as that flask seemed perched at the masthead of some ship which had sunk to all but her trucks but little kingpost was small and short and at the same time little kingpost was full of a large and tall ambition so that this loggerhead standpoint of his did by no means satisfy kingpost ,MobyDick or The Whale
whereupon planting his feet firmly against two opposite planks of the boat the gigantic negro stooping a little presented his flat palm to flasks foot and then putting flasks hand on his hearseplumed head and bidding him spring as he himself should toss with one dexterous fling landed the little man high and dry on his shoulders and here was flask now standing daggoo with one lifted arm furnishing him with a breastband to lean against and steady himself by ,MobyDick or The Whale
at any time it is a strange sight to the tyro to see with what wondrous habitude of unconscious skill the whaleman will maintain an erect posture in his boat even when pitched about by the most riotously perverse and crossrunning seas still more strange to see him giddily perched upon the loggerhead itself under such circumstances but the sight of little flask mounted upon gigantic daggoo was yet more curious for sustaining himself with a cool indifferent easy unthought of barbaric majesty the noble negro to every roll of the sea harmoniously rolled his fine form on his broad back flaxenhaired flask seemed a snowflake the bearer looked nobler than the rider though truly vivacious tumultuous ostentatious little flask would now and then stamp with impatience but not one added heave did he thereby give to the negros lordly chest so have i seen passion and vanity stamping the living magnanimous earth but the earth did not alter her tides and her seasons for that ,MobyDick or The Whale
meanwhile stubb the third mate betrayed no such fargazing solicitudes the whales might have made one of their regular soundings not a temporary dive from mere fright and if that were the case stubb as his wont in such cases it seems was resolved to solace the languishing interval with his pipe he withdrew it from his hatband where he always wore it aslant like a feather he loaded it and rammed home the loading with his thumbend but hardly had he ignited his match across the rough sandpaper of his hand when tashtego his harpooneer whose eyes had been setting to windward like two fixed stars suddenly dropped like light from his erect attitude to his seat crying out in a quick phrensy of hurry down down all and give waythere they are ,MobyDick or The Whale
to a landsman no whale nor any sign of a herring would have been visible at that moment nothing but a troubled bit of greenish white water and thin scattered puffs of vapor hovering over it and suffusingly blowing off to leeward like the confused scud from white rolling billows the air around suddenly vibrated and tingled as it were like the air over intensely heated plates of iron beneath this atmospheric waving and curling and partially beneath a thin layer of water also the whales were swimming seen in advance of all the other indications the puffs of vapor they spouted seemed their forerunning couriers and detached flying outriders ,MobyDick or The Whale
all four boats were now in keen pursuit of that one spot of troubled water and air but it bade fair to outstrip them it flew on and on as a mass of interblending bubbles borne down a rapid stream from the hills ,MobyDick or The Whale
pull pull my good boys said starbuck in the lowest possible but intensest concentrated whisper to his men while the sharp fixed glance from his eyes darted straight ahead of the bow almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses he did not say much to his crew though nor did his crew say anything to him only the silence of the boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers now harsh with command now soft with entreaty ,MobyDick or The Whale
how different the loud little kingpost sing out and say something my hearties roar and pull my thunderbolts beach me beach me on their black backs boys only do that for me and ill sign over to you my marthas vineyard plantation boys including wife and children boys lay me onlay me on o lord lord but i shall go stark staring mad see see that white water and so shouting he pulled his hat from his head and stamped up and down on it then picking it up flirted it far off upon the sea and finally fell to rearing and plunging in the boats stern like a crazed colt from the prairie ,MobyDick or The Whale
look at that chap now philosophically drawled stubb who with his unlighted short pipe mechanically retained between his teeth at a short distance followed afterhes got fits that flask has fits yes give him fitsthats the very wordpitch fits into em merrily merrily heartsalive pudding for supper you knowmerrys the word pull babespull sucklingspull all but what the devil are you hurrying about softly softly and steadily my men only pull and keep pulling nothing more crack all your backbones and bite your knives in twothats all take it easywhy dont ye take it easy i say and burst all your livers and lungs ,MobyDick or The Whale
but what it was that inscrutable ahab said to that tigeryellow crew of histhese were words best omitted here for you live under the blessed light of the evangelical land only the infidel sharks in the audacious seas may give ear to such words when with tornado brow and eyes of red murder and foamglued lips ahab leaped after his prey ,MobyDick or The Whale
meanwhile all the boats tore on the repeated specific allusions of flask to that whale as he called the fictitious monster which he declared to be incessantly tantalizing his boats bow with its tailthese allusions of his were at times so vivid and lifelike that they would cause some one or two of his men to snatch a fearful look over the shoulder but this was against all rule for the oarsmen must put out their eyes and ram a skewer through their necks usage pronouncing that they must have no organs but ears and no limbs but arms in these critical moments ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a sight full of quick wonder and awe the vast swells of the omnipotent sea the surging hollow roar they made as they rolled along the eight gunwales like gigantic bowls in a boundless bowlinggreen the brief suspended agony of the boat as it would tip for an instant on the knifelike edge of the sharper waves that almost seemed threatening to cut it in two the sudden profound dip into the watery glens and hollows the keen spurrings and goadings to gain the top of the opposite hill the headlong sledlike slide down its other sideall these with the cries of the headsmen and harpooneers and the shuddering gasps of the oarsmen with the wondrous sight of the ivory pequod bearing down upon her boats with outstretched sails like a wild hen after her screaming broodall this was thrilling ,MobyDick or The Whale
not the raw recruit marching from the bosom of his wife into the fever heat of his first battle not the dead mans ghost encountering the first unknown phantom in the other worldneither of these can feel stranger and stronger emotions than that man does who for the first time finds himself pulling into the charmed churned circle of the hunted sperm whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
the dancing white water made by the chase was now becoming more and more visible owing to the increasing darkness of the dun cloudshadows flung upon the sea the jets of vapor no longer blended but tilted everywhere to right and left the whales seemed separating their wakes the boats were pulled more apart starbuck giving chase to three whales running dead to leeward our sail was now set and with the still rising wind we rushed along the boat going with such madness through the water that the lee oars could scarcely be worked rapidly enough to escape being torn from the rowlocks ,MobyDick or The Whale
soon after two cries in quick succession on each side of us denoted that the other boats had got fast but hardly were they overheard when with a lightninglike hurtling whisper starbuck said stand up and queequeg harpoon in hand sprang to his feet ,MobyDick or The Whale
though not one of the oarsmen was then facing the life and death peril so close to them ahead yet with their eyes on the intense countenance of the mate in the stern of the boat they knew that the imminent instant had come they heard too an enormous wallowing sound as of fifty elephants stirring in their litter meanwhile the boat was still booming through the mist the waves curling and hissing around us like the erected crests of enraged serpents ,MobyDick or The Whale
a short rushing sound leaped out of the boat it was the darted iron of queequeg then all in one welded commotion came an invisible push from astern while forward the boat seemed striking on a ledge the sail collapsed and exploded a gush of scalding vapor shot up near by something rolled and tumbled like an earthquake beneath us the whole crew were half suffocated as they were tossed helterskelter into the white curdling cream of the squall squall whale and harpoon had all blended together and the whale merely grazed by the iron escaped ,MobyDick or The Whale
though completely swamped the boat was nearly unharmed swimming round it we picked up the floating oars and lashing them across the gunwale tumbled back to our places there we sat up to our knees in the sea the water covering every rib and plank so that to our downward gazing eyes the suspended craft seemed a coral boat grown up to us from the bottom of the ocean ,MobyDick or The Whale
the wind increased to a howl the waves dashed their bucklers together the whole squall roared forked and crackled around us like a white fire upon the prairie in which unconsumed we were burning immortal in these jaws of death in vain we hailed the other boats as well roar to the live coals down the chimney of a flaming furnace as hail those boats in that storm meanwhile the driving scud rack and mist grew darker with the shadows of night no sign of the ship could be seen the rising sea forbade all attempts to bale out the boat the oars were useless as propellers performing now the office of lifepreservers so cutting the lashing of the waterproof match keg after many failures starbuck contrived to ignite the lamp in the lantern then stretching it on a waif pole handed it to queequeg as the standardbearer of this forlorn hope there then he sat holding up that imbecile candle in the heart of that almighty forlornness there then he sat the sign and symbol of a man without faith hopelessly holding up hope in the midst of despair ,MobyDick or The Whale
wet drenched through and shivering cold despairing of ship or boat we lifted up our eyes as the dawn came on the mist still spread over the sea the empty lantern lay crushed in the bottom of the boat suddenly queequeg started to his feet hollowing his hand to his ear we all heard a faint creaking as of ropes and yards hitherto muffled by the storm the sound came nearer and nearer the thick mists were dimly parted by a huge vague form affrighted we all sprang into the sea as the ship at last loomed into view bearing right down upon us within a distance of not much more than its length ,MobyDick or The Whale
floating on the waves we saw the abandoned boat as for one instant it tossed and gaped beneath the ships bows like a chip at the base of a cataract and then the vast hull rolled over it and it was seen no more till it came up weltering astern again we swam for it were dashed against it by the seas and were at last taken up and safely landed on board ere the squall came close to the other boats had cut loose from their fish and returned to the ship in good time the ship had given us up but was still cruising if haply it might light upon some token of our perishingan oar or a lance pole ,MobyDick or The Whale
there are certain queer times and occasions in this strange mixed affair we call life when a man takes this whole universe for a vast practical joke though the wit thereof he but dimly discerns and more than suspects that the joke is at nobodys expense but his own however nothing dispirits and nothing seems worth while disputing he bolts down all events all creeds and beliefs and persuasions all hard things visible and invisible never mind how knobby as an ostrich of potent digestion gobbles down bullets and gun flints and as for small difficulties and worryings prospects of sudden disaster peril of life and limb all these and death itself seem to him only sly goodnatured hits and jolly punches in the side bestowed by the unseen and unaccountable old joker that odd sort of wayward mood i am speaking of comes over a man only in some time of extreme tribulation it comes in the very midst of his earnestness so that what just before might have seemed to him a thing most momentous now seems but a part of the general joke there is nothing like the perils of whaling to breed this free and easy sort of genial desperado philosophy and with it i now regarded this whole voyage of the pequod and the great white whale its object ,MobyDick or The Whale
queequeg said i when they had dragged me the last man to the deck and i was still shaking myself in my jacket to fling off the water queequeg my fine friend does this sort of thing often happen without much emotion though soaked through just like me he gave me to understand that such things did often happen ,MobyDick or The Whale
mr stubb said i turning to that worthy who buttoned up in his oiljacket was now calmly smoking his pipe in the rain mr stubb i think i have heard you say that of all whalemen you ever met our chief mate mr starbuck is by far the most careful and prudent i suppose then that going plump on a flying whale with your sail set in a foggy squall is the height of a whalemans discretion ,MobyDick or The Whale
mr flask said i turning to little kingpost who was standing close by you are experienced in these things and i am not will you tell me whether it is an unalterable law in this fishery mr flask for an oarsman to break his own back pulling himself backforemost into deaths jaws ,MobyDick or The Whale
cant you twist that smaller said flask yes thats the law i should like to see a boats crew backing water up to a whale face foremost ha ha the whale would give them squint for squint mind that ,MobyDick or The Whale
here then from three impartial witnesses i had a deliberate statement of the entire case considering therefore that squalls and capsizings in the water and consequent bivouacks on the deep were matters of common occurrence in this kind of life considering that at the superlatively critical instant of going on to the whale i must resign my life into the hands of him who steered the boatoftentimes a fellow who at that very moment is in his impetuousness upon the point of scuttling the craft with his own frantic stampings considering that the particular disaster to our own particular boat was chiefly to be imputed to starbucks driving on to his whale almost in the teeth of a squall and considering that starbuck notwithstanding was famous for his great heedfulness in the fishery considering that i belonged to this uncommonly prudent starbucks boat and finally considering in what a devils chase i was implicated touching the white whale taking all things together i say i thought i might as well go below and make a rough draft of my will queequeg said i come along you shall be my lawyer executor and legatee ,MobyDick or The Whale
it may seem strange that of all men sailors should be tinkering at their last wills and testaments but there are no people in the world more fond of that diversion this was the fourth time in my nautical life that i had done the same thing after the ceremony was concluded upon the present occasion i felt all the easier a stone was rolled away from my heart besides all the days i should now live would be as good as the days that lazarus lived after his resurrection a supplementary clean gain of so many months or weeks as the case might be i survived myself my death and burial were locked up in my chest i looked round me tranquilly and contentedly like a quiet ghost with a clean conscience sitting inside the bars of a snug family vault ,MobyDick or The Whale
i dont think it so strange after all on that account said flask if his leg were off at the hip now it would be a different thing that would disable him but he has one knee and good part of the other left you know ,MobyDick or The Whale
among whalewise people it has often been argued whether considering the paramount importance of his life to the success of the voyage it is right for a whaling captain to jeopardize that life in the active perils of the chase so tamerlanes soldiers often argued with tears in their eyes whether that invaluable life of his ought to be carried into the thickest of the fight ,MobyDick or The Whale
but with ahab the question assumed a modified aspect considering that with two legs man is but a hobbling wight in all times of danger considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties that every individual moment indeed then comprises a peril under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whaleboat in the hunt as a general thing the jointowners of the pequod must have plainly thought not ,MobyDick or The Whale
ahab well knew that although his friends at home would think little of his entering a boat in certain comparatively harmless vicissitudes of the chase for the sake of being near the scene of action and giving his orders in person yet for captain ahab to have a boat actually apportioned to him as a regular headsman in the huntabove all for captain ahab to be supplied with five extra men as that same boats crew he well knew that such generous conceits never entered the heads of the owners of the pequod therefore he had not solicited a boats crew from them nor had he in any way hinted his desires on that head nevertheless he had taken private measures of his own touching all that matter until cabacos published discovery the sailors had little foreseen it though to be sure when after being a little while out of port all hands had concluded the customary business of fitting the whaleboats for service when some time after this ahab was now and then found bestirring himself in the matter of making tholepins with his own hands for what was thought to be one of the spare boats and even solicitously cutting the small wooden skewers which when the line is running out are pinned over the groove in the bow when all this was observed in him and particularly his solicitude in having an extra coat of sheathing in the bottom of the boat as if to make it better withstand the pointed pressure of his ivory limb and also the anxiety he evinced in exactly shaping the thigh board or clumsy cleat as it is sometimes called the horizontal piece in the boats bow for bracing the knee against in darting or stabbing at the whale when it was observed how often he stood up in that boat with his solitary knee fixed in the semicircular depression in the cleat and with the carpenters chisel gouged out a little here and straightened it a little there all these things i say had awakened much interest and curiosity at the time but almost everybody supposed that this particular preparative heedfulness in ahab must only be with a view to the ultimate chase of moby dick for he had already revealed his intention to hunt that mortal monster in person but such a supposition did by no means involve the remotest suspicion as to any boats crew being assigned to that boat ,MobyDick or The Whale
now with the subordinate phantoms what wonder remained soon waned away for in a whaler wonders soon wane besides now and then such unaccountable odds and ends of strange nations come up from the unknown nooks and ashholes of the earth to man these floating outlaws of whalers and the ships themselves often pick up such queer castaway creatures found tossing about the open sea on planks bits of wreck oars whaleboats canoes blownoff japanese junks and what not that beelzebub himself might climb up the side and step down into the cabin to chat with the captain and it would not create any unsubduable excitement in the forecastle ,MobyDick or The Whale
but be all this as it may certain it is that while the subordinate phantoms soon found their place among the crew though still as it were somehow distinct from them yet that hairturbaned fedallah remained a muffled mystery to the last whence he came in a mannerly world like this by what sort of unaccountable tie he soon evinced himself to be linked with ahabs peculiar fortunes nay so far as to have some sort of a halfhinted influence heaven knows but it might have been even authority over him all this none knew but one cannot sustain an indifferent air concerning fedallah he was such a creature as civilized domestic people in the temperate zone only see in their dreams and that but dimly but the like of whom now and then glide among the unchanging asiatic communities especially the oriental isles to the east of the continentthose insulated immemorial unalterable countries which even in these modern days still preserve much of the ghostly aboriginalness of earths primal generations when the memory of the first man was a distinct recollection and all men his descendants unknowing whence he came eyed each other as real phantoms and asked of the sun and the moon why they were created and to what end when though according to genesis the angels indeed consorted with the daughters of men the devils also add the uncanonical rabbins indulged in mundane amours ,MobyDick or The Whale
days weeks passed and under easy sail the ivory pequod had slowly swept across four several cruisinggrounds that off the azores off the cape de verdes on the plate so called being off the mouth of the rio de la plata and the carrol ground an unstaked watery locality southerly from st helena ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was while gliding through these latter waters that one serene and moonlight night when all the waves rolled by like scrolls of silver and by their soft suffusing seethings made what seemed a silvery silence not a solitude on such a silent night a silvery jet was seen far in advance of the white bubbles at the bow lit up by the moon it looked celestial seemed some plumed and glittering god uprising from the sea fedallah first descried this jet for of these moonlight nights it was his wont to mount to the mainmast head and stand a lookout there with the same precision as if it had been day and yet though herds of whales were seen by night not one whaleman in a hundred would venture a lowering for them you may think with what emotions then the seamen beheld this old oriental perched aloft at such unusual hours his turban and the moon companions in one sky but when after spending his uniform interval there for several successive nights without uttering a single sound when after all this silence his unearthly voice was heard announcing that silvery moonlit jet every reclining mariner started to his feet as if some winged spirit had lighted in the rigging and hailed the mortal crew there she blows had the trump of judgment blown they could not have quivered more yet still they felt no terror rather pleasure for though it was a most unwonted hour yet so impressive was the cry and so deliriously exciting that almost every soul on board instinctively desired a lowering ,MobyDick or The Whale
walking the deck with quick sidelunging strides ahab commanded the tgallant sails and royals to be set and every stunsail spread the best man in the ship must take the helm then with every masthead manned the piledup craft rolled down before the wind the strange upheaving lifting tendency of the taffrail breeze filling the hollows of so many sails made the buoyant hovering deck to feel like air beneath the feet while still she rushed along as if two antagonistic influences were struggling in herone to mount direct to heaven the other to drive yawingly to some horizontal goal and had you watched ahabs face that night you would have thought that in him also two different things were warring while his one live leg made lively echoes along the deck every stroke of his dead limb sounded like a coffintap on life and death this old man walked but though the ship so swiftly sped and though from every eye like arrows the eager glances shot yet the silvery jet was no more seen that night every sailor swore he saw it once but not a second time ,MobyDick or The Whale
this midnightspout had almost grown a forgotten thing when some days after lo at the same silent hour it was again announced again it was descried by all but upon making sail to overtake it once more it disappeared as if it had never been and so it served us night after night till no one heeded it but to wonder at it mysteriously jetted into the clear moonlight or starlight as the case might be disappearing again for one whole day or two days or three and somehow seeming at every distinct repetition to be advancing still further and further in our van this solitary jet seemed for ever alluring us on ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor with the immemorial superstition of their race and in accordance with the preternaturalness as it seemed which in many things invested the pequod were there wanting some of the seamen who swore that whenever and wherever descried at however remote times or in however far apart latitudes and longitudes that unnearable spout was cast by one selfsame whale and that whale moby dick for a time there reigned too a sense of peculiar dread at this flitting apparition as if it were treacherously beckoning us on and on in order that the monster might turn round upon us and rend us at last in the remotest and most savage seas ,MobyDick or The Whale
these temporary apprehensions so vague but so awful derived a wondrous potency from the contrasting serenity of the weather in which beneath all its blue blandness some thought there lurked a devilish charm as for days and days we voyaged along through seas so wearily lonesomely mild that all space in repugnance to our vengeful errand seemed vacating itself of life before our urnlike prow ,MobyDick or The Whale
but at last when turning to the eastward the cape winds began howling around us and we rose and fell upon the long troubled seas that are there when the ivorytusked pequod sharply bowed to the blast and gored the dark waves in her madness till like showers of silver chips the foamflakes flew over her bulwarks then all this desolate vacuity of life went away but gave place to sights more dismal than before ,MobyDick or The Whale
close to our bows strange forms in the water darted hither and thither before us while thick in our rear flew the inscrutable searavens and every morning perched on our stays rows of these birds were seen and spite of our hootings for a long time obstinately clung to the hemp as though they deemed our ship some drifting uninhabited craft a thing appointed to desolation and therefore fit roostingplace for their homeless selves and heaved and heaved still unrestingly heaved the black sea as if its vast tides were a conscience and the great mundane soul were in anguish and remorse for the long sin and suffering it had bred ,MobyDick or The Whale
cape of good hope do they call ye rather cape tormentoso as called of yore for long allured by the perfidious silences that before had attended us we found ourselves launched into this tormented sea where guilty beings transformed into those fowls and these fish seemed condemned to swim on everlastingly without any haven in store or beat that black air without any horizon but calm snowwhite and unvarying still directing its fountain of feathers to the sky still beckoning us on from before the solitary jet would at times be descried ,MobyDick or The Whale
during all this blackness of the elements ahab though assuming for the time the almost continual command of the drenched and dangerous deck manifested the gloomiest reserve and more seldom than ever addressed his mates in tempestuous times like these after everything above and aloft has been secured nothing more can be done but passively to await the issue of the gale then captain and crew become practical fatalists so with his ivory leg inserted into its accustomed hole and with one hand firmly grasping a shroud ahab for hours and hours would stand gazing dead to windward while an occasional squall of sleet or snow would all but congeal his very eyelashes together meantime the crew driven from the forward part of the ship by the perilous seas that burstingly broke over its bows stood in a line along the bulwarks in the waist and the better to guard against the leaping waves each man had slipped himself into a sort of bowline secured to the rail in which he swung as in a loosened belt few or no words were spoken and the silent ship as if manned by painted sailors in wax day after day tore on through all the swift madness and gladness of the demoniac waves by night the same muteness of humanity before the shrieks of the ocean prevailed still in silence the men swung in the bowlines still wordless ahab stood up to the blast even when wearied nature seemed demanding repose he would not seek that repose in his hammock never could starbuck forget the old mans aspect when one night going down into the cabin to mark how the barometer stood he saw him with closed eyes sitting straight in his floorscrewed chair the rain and halfmelted sleet of the storm from which he had some time before emerged still slowly dripping from the unremoved hat and coat on the table beside him lay unrolled one of those charts of tides and currents which have previously been spoken of his lantern swung from his tightly clenched hand though the body was erect the head was thrown back so that the closed eyes were pointed towards the needle of the telltale that swung from a beam in the ceiling ,MobyDick or The Whale
southeastward from the cape off the distant crozetts a good cruising ground for right whalemen a sail loomed ahead the goney albatross by name as she slowly drew nigh from my lofty perch at the foremasthead i had a good view of that sight so remarkable to a tyro in the far ocean fisheriesa whaler at sea and long absent from home ,MobyDick or The Whale
as if the waves had been fullers this craft was bleached like the skeleton of a stranded walrus all down her sides this spectral appearance was traced with long channels of reddened rust while all her spars and her rigging were like the thick branches of trees furred over with hoarfrost only her lower sails were set a wild sight it was to see her longbearded lookouts at those three mastheads they seemed clad in the skins of beasts so torn and bepatched the raiment that had survived nearly four years of cruising standing in iron hoops nailed to the mast they swayed and swung over a fathomless sea and though when the ship slowly glided close under our stern we six men in the air came so nigh to each other that we might almost have leaped from the mastheads of one ship to those of the other yet those forlornlooking fishermen mildly eyeing us as they passed said not one word to our own lookouts while the quarterdeck hail was being heard from below ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as the strange captain leaning over the pallid bulwarks was in the act of putting his trumpet to his mouth it somehow fell from his hand into the sea and the wind now rising amain he in vain strove to make himself heard without it meantime his ship was still increasing the distance between while in various silent ways the seamen of the pequod were evincing their observance of this ominous incident at the first mere mention of the white whales name to another ship ahab for a moment paused it almost seemed as though he would have lowered a boat to board the stranger had not the threatening wind forbade but taking advantage of his windward position he again seized his trumpet and knowing by her aspect that the stranger vessel was a nantucketer and shortly bound home he loudly hailedahoy there this is the pequod bound round the world tell them to address all future letters to the pacific ocean and this time three years if i am not at home tell them to address them to  ,MobyDick or The Whale
at that moment the two wakes were fairly crossed and instantly then in accordance with their singular ways shoals of small harmless fish that for some days before had been placidly swimming by our side darted away with what seemed shuddering fins and ranged themselves fore and aft with the strangers flanks though in the course of his continual voyagings ahab must often before have noticed a similar sight yet to any monomaniac man the veriest trifles capriciously carry meanings ,MobyDick or The Whale
swim away from me do ye murmured ahab gazing over into the water there seemed but little in the words but the tone conveyed more of deep helpless sadness than the insane old man had ever before evinced but turning to the steersman who thus far had been holding the ship in the wind to diminish her headway he cried out in his old lion voiceup helm keep her off round the world ,MobyDick or The Whale
round the world there is much in that sound to inspire proud feelings but whereto does all that circumnavigation conduct only through numberless perils to the very point whence we started where those that we left behind secure were all the time before us ,MobyDick or The Whale
were this world an endless plain and by sailing eastward we could for ever reach new distances and discover sights more sweet and strange than any cyclades or islands of king solomon then there were promise in the voyage but in pursuit of those far mysteries we dream of or in tormented chase of that demon phantom that some time or other swims before all human hearts while chasing such over this round globe they either lead us on in barren mazes or midway leave us whelmed ,MobyDick or The Whale
the ostensible reason why ahab did not go on board of the whaler we had spoken was this the wind and sea betokened storms but even had this not been the case he would not after all perhaps have boarded herjudging by his subsequent conduct on similar occasionsif so it had been that by the process of hailing he had obtained a negative answer to the question he put for as it eventually turned out he cared not to consort even for five minutes with any stranger captain except he could contribute some of that information he so absorbingly sought but all this might remain inadequately estimated were not something said here of the peculiar usages of whalingvessels when meeting each other in foreign seas and especially on a common cruisingground ,MobyDick or The Whale
if two strangers crossing the pine barrens in new york state or the equally desolate salisbury plain in england if casually encountering each other in such inhospitable wilds these twain for the life of them cannot well avoid a mutual salutation and stopping for a moment to interchange the news and perhaps sitting down for a while and resting in concert then how much more natural that upon the illimitable pine barrens and salisbury plains of the sea two whaling vessels descrying each other at the ends of the earthoff lone fannings island or the far away kings mills how much more natural i say that under such circumstances these ships should not only interchange hails but come into still closer more friendly and sociable contact and especially would this seem to be a matter of course in the case of vessels owned in one seaport and whose captains officers and not a few of the men are personally known to each other and consequently have all sorts of dear domestic things to talk about ,MobyDick or The Whale
for the long absent ship the outwardbounder perhaps has letters on board at any rate she will be sure to let her have some papers of a date a year or two later than the last one on her blurred and thumbworn files and in return for that courtesy the outwardbound ship would receive the latest whaling intelligence from the cruisingground to which she may be destined a thing of the utmost importance to her and in degree all this will hold true concerning whaling vessels crossing each others track on the cruisingground itself even though they are equally long absent from home for one of them may have received a transfer of letters from some third and now far remote vessel and some of those letters may be for the people of the ship she now meets besides they would exchange the whaling news and have an agreeable chat for not only would they meet with all the sympathies of sailors but likewise with all the peculiar congenialities arising from a common pursuit and mutually shared privations and perils ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor would difference of country make any very essential difference that is so long as both parties speak one language as is the case with americans and english though to be sure from the small number of english whalers such meetings do not very often occur and when they do occur there is too apt to be a sort of shyness between them for your englishman is rather reserved and your yankee he does not fancy that sort of thing in anybody but himself besides the english whalers sometimes affect a kind of metropolitan superiority over the american whalers regarding the long lean nantucketer with his nondescript provincialisms as a sort of seapeasant but where this superiority in the english whalemen does really consist it would be hard to say seeing that the yankees in one day collectively kill more whales than all the english collectively in ten years but this is a harmless little foible in the english whalehunters which the nantucketer does not take much to heart probably because he knows that he has a few foibles himself ,MobyDick or The Whale
so then we see that of all ships separately sailing the sea the whalers have most reason to be sociableand they are so whereas some merchant ships crossing each others wake in the midatlantic will oftentimes pass on without so much as a single word of recognition mutually cutting each other on the high seas like a brace of dandies in broadway and all the time indulging perhaps in finical criticism upon each others rig as for menofwar when they chance to meet at sea they first go through such a string of silly bowings and scrapings such a ducking of ensigns that there does not seem to be much rightdown hearty goodwill and brotherly love about it at all as touching slaveships meeting why they are in such a prodigious hurry they run away from each other as soon as possible and as for pirates when they chance to cross each others crossbones the first hail ishow many skullsthe same way that whalers hailhow many barrels and that question once answered pirates straightway steer apart for they are infernal villains on both sides and dont like to see overmuch of each others villanous likenesses ,MobyDick or The Whale
but look at the godly honest unostentatious hospitable sociable freeandeasy whaler what does the whaler do when she meets another whaler in any sort of decent weather she has a gam a thing so utterly unknown to all other ships that they never heard of the name even and if by chance they should hear of it they only grin at it and repeat gamesome stuff about spouters and blubberboilers and such like pretty exclamations why it is that all merchantseamen and also all pirates and manofwars men and slaveship sailors cherish such a scornful feeling towards whaleships this is a question it would be hard to answer because in the case of pirates say i should like to know whether that profession of theirs has any peculiar glory about it it sometimes ends in uncommon elevation indeed but only at the gallows and besides when a man is elevated in that odd fashion he has no proper foundation for his superior altitude hence i conclude that in boasting himself to be high lifted above a whaleman in that assertion the pirate has no solid basis to stand on ,MobyDick or The Whale
but what is a gam you might wear out your indexfinger running up and down the columns of dictionaries and never find the word dr johnson never attained to that erudition noah websters ark does not hold it nevertheless this same expressive word has now for many years been in constant use among some fifteen thousand true born yankees certainly it needs a definition and should be incorporated into the lexicon with that view let me learnedly define it ,MobyDick or The Whale
gam nouna social meeting of two or more whaleships generally on a cruisingground when after exchanging hails they exchange visits by boats crews the two captains remaining for the time on board of one ship and the two chief mates on the other ,MobyDick or The Whale
there is another little item about gamming which must not be forgotten here all professions have their own little peculiarities of detail so has the whale fishery in a pirate manofwar or slave ship when the captain is rowed anywhere in his boat he always sits in the stern sheets on a comfortable sometimes cushioned seat there and often steers himself with a pretty little milliners tiller decorated with gay cords and ribbons but the whaleboat has no seat astern no sofa of that sort whatever and no tiller at all high times indeed if whaling captains were wheeled about the water on castors like gouty old aldermen in patent chairs and as for a tiller the whaleboat never admits of any such effeminacy and therefore as in gamming a complete boats crew must leave the ship and hence as the boat steerer or harpooneer is of the number that subordinate is the steersman upon the occasion and the captain having no place to sit in is pulled off to his visit all standing like a pine tree and often you will notice that being conscious of the eyes of the whole visible world resting on him from the sides of the two ships this standing captain is all alive to the importance of sustaining his dignity by maintaining his legs nor is this any very easy matter for in his rear is the immense projecting steering oar hitting him now and then in the small of his back the afteroar reciprocating by rapping his knees in front he is thus completely wedged before and behind and can only expand himself sideways by settling down on his stretched legs but a sudden violent pitch of the boat will often go far to topple him because length of foundation is nothing without corresponding breadth merely make a spread angle of two poles and you cannot stand them up then again it would never do in plain sight of the worlds riveted eyes it would never do i say for this straddling captain to be seen steadying himself the slightest particle by catching hold of anything with his hands indeed as token of his entire buoyant selfcommand he generally carries his hands in his trowsers pockets but perhaps being generally very large heavy hands he carries them there for ballast nevertheless there have occurred instances well authenticated ones too where the captain has been known for an uncommonly critical moment or two in a sudden squall sayto seize hold of the nearest oarsmans hair and hold on there like grim death ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was not very long after speaking the goney that another homewardbound whaleman the townho was encountered she was manned almost wholly by polynesians in the short gam that ensued she gave us strong news of moby dick to some the general interest in the white whale was now wildly heightened by a circumstance of the townhos story which seemed obscurely to involve with the whale a certain wondrous inverted visitation of one of those so called judgments of god which at times are said to overtake some men this latter circumstance with its own particular accompaniments forming what may be called the secret part of the tragedy about to be narrated never reached the ears of captain ahab or his mates for that secret part of the story was unknown to the captain of the townho himself it was the private property of three confederate white seamen of that ship one of whom it seems communicated it to tashtego with romish injunctions of secrecy but the following night tashtego rambled in his sleep and revealed so much of it in that way that when he was wakened he could not well withhold the rest nevertheless so potent an influence did this thing have on those seamen in the pequod who came to the full knowledge of it and by such a strange delicacy to call it so were they governed in this matter that they kept the secret among themselves so that it never transpired abaft the pequods mainmast interweaving in its proper place this darker thread with the story as publicly narrated on the ship the whole of this strange affair i now proceed to put on lasting record ,MobyDick or The Whale
for my humors sake i shall preserve the style in which i once narrated it at lima to a lounging circle of my spanish friends one saints eve smoking upon the thickgilt tiled piazza of the golden inn of those fine cavaliers the young dons pedro and sebastian were on the closer terms with me and hence the interluding questions they occasionally put and which are duly answered at the time ,MobyDick or The Whale
some two years prior to my first learning the events which i am about rehearsing to you gentlemen the townho sperm whaler of nantucket was cruising in your pacific here not very many days sail eastward from the eaves of this good golden inn she was somewhere to the northward of the line one morning upon handling the pumps according to daily usage it was observed that she made more water in her hold than common they supposed a swordfish had stabbed her gentlemen but the captain having some unusual reason for believing that rare good luck awaited him in those latitudes and therefore being very averse to quit them and the leak not being then considered at all dangerous though indeed they could not find it after searching the hold as low down as was possible in rather heavy weather the ship still continued her cruisings the mariners working at the pumps at wide and easy intervals but no good luck came more days went by and not only was the leak yet undiscovered but it sensibly increased so much so that now taking some alarm the captain making all sail stood away for the nearest harbor among the islands there to have his hull hove out and repaired ,MobyDick or The Whale
though no small passage was before her yet if the commonest chance favoured he did not at all fear that his ship would founder by the way because his pumps were of the best and being periodically relieved at them those sixandthirty men of his could easily keep the ship free never mind if the leak should double on her in truth well nigh the whole of this passage being attended by very prosperous breezes the townho had all but certainly arrived in perfect safety at her port without the occurrence of the least fatality had it not been for the brutal overbearing of radney the mate a vineyarder and the bitterly provoked vengeance of steelkilt a lakeman and desperado from buffalo ,MobyDick or The Whale
on the eastern shore of our lake erie don buti crave your courtesymay be you shall soon hear further of all that now gentlemen in squaresail brigs and threemasted ships wellnigh as large and stout as any that ever sailed out of your old callao to far manilla this lakeman in the landlocked heart of our america had yet been nurtured by all those agrarian freebooting impressions popularly connected with the open ocean for in their interflowing aggregate those grand freshwater seas of ourserie and ontario and huron and superior and michiganpossess an oceanlike expansiveness with many of the oceans noblest traits with many of its rimmed varieties of races and of climes they contain round archipelagoes of romantic isles even as the polynesian waters do in large part are shored by two great contrasting nations as the atlantic is they furnish long maritime approaches to our numerous territorial colonies from the east dotted all round their banks here and there are frowned upon by batteries and by the goatlike craggy guns of lofty mackinaw they have heard the fleet thunderings of naval victories at intervals they yield their beaches to wild barbarians whose red painted faces flash from out their peltry wigwams for leagues and leagues are flanked by ancient and unentered forests where the gaunt pines stand like serried lines of kings in gothic genealogies those same woods harboring wild afric beasts of prey and silken creatures whose exported furs give robes to tartar emperors they mirror the paved capitals of buffalo and cleveland as well as winnebago villages they float alike the fullrigged merchant ship the armed cruiser of the state the steamer and the beech canoe they are swept by borean and dismasting blasts as direful as any that lash the salted wave they know what shipwrecks are for out of sight of land however inland they have drowned full many a midnight ship with all its shrieking crew thus gentlemen though an inlander steelkilt was wildocean born and wildocean nurtured as much of an audacious mariner as any and for radney though in his infancy he may have laid him down on the lone nantucket beach to nurse at his maternal sea though in after life he had long followed our austere atlantic and your contemplative pacific yet was he quite as vengeful and full of social quarrel as the backwoods seaman fresh from the latitudes of buckhorn handled bowieknives yet was this nantucketer a man with some goodhearted traits and this lakeman a mariner who though a sort of devil indeed might yet by inflexible firmness only tempered by that common decency of human recognition which is the meanest slaves right thus treated this steelkilt had long been retained harmless and docile at all events he had proved so thus far but radney was doomed and made mad and steelkiltbut gentlemen you shall hear ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was not more than a day or two at the furthest after pointing her prow for her island haven that the townhos leak seemed again increasing but only so as to require an hour or more at the pumps every day you must know that in a settled and civilized ocean like our atlantic for example some skippers think little of pumping their whole way across it though of a still sleepy night should the officer of the deck happen to forget his duty in that respect the probability would be that he and his shipmates would never again remember it on account of all hands gently subsiding to the bottom nor in the solitary and savage seas far from you to the westward gentlemen is it altogether unusual for ships to keep clanging at their pumphandles in full chorus even for a voyage of considerable length that is if it lie along a tolerably accessible coast or if any other reasonable retreat is afforded them it is only when a leaky vessel is in some very out of the way part of those waters some really landless latitude that her captain begins to feel a little anxious ,MobyDick or The Whale
much this way had it been with the townho so when her leak was found gaining once more there was in truth some small concern manifested by several of her company especially by radney the mate he commanded the upper sails to be well hoisted sheeted home anew and every way expanded to the breeze now this radney i suppose was as little of a coward and as little inclined to any sort of nervous apprehensiveness touching his own person as any fearless unthinking creature on land or on sea that you can conveniently imagine gentlemen therefore when he betrayed this solicitude about the safety of the ship some of the seamen declared that it was only on account of his being a part owner in her so when they were working that evening at the pumps there was on this head no small gamesomeness slily going on among them as they stood with their feet continually overflowed by the rippling clear water clear as any mountain spring gentlementhat bubbling from the pumps ran across the deck and poured itself out in steady spouts at the lee scupperholes ,MobyDick or The Whale
now as you well know it is not seldom the case in this conventional world of ourswatery or otherwise that when a person placed in command over his fellowmen finds one of them to be very significantly his superior in general pride of manhood straightway against that man he conceives an unconquerable dislike and bitterness and if he have a chance he will pull down and pulverize that subalterns tower and make a little heap of dust of it be this conceit of mine as it may gentlemen at all events steelkilt was a tall and noble animal with a head like a roman and a flowing golden beard like the tasseled housings of your last viceroys snorting charger and a brain and a heart and a soul in him gentlemen which had made steelkilt charlemagne had he been born son to charlemagnes father but radney the mate was ugly as a mule yet as hardy as stubborn as malicious he did not love steelkilt and steelkilt knew it ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye aye my merry lads its a lively leak this hold a cannikin one of ye and lets have a taste by the lord its worth bottling i tell ye what men old rads investment must go for it he had best cut away his part of the hull and tow it home the fact is boys that swordfish only began the job hes come back again with a gang of shipcarpenters sawfish and filefish and what not and the whole posse of em are now hard at work cutting and slashing at the bottom making improvements i suppose if old rad were here now id tell him to jump overboard and scatter em theyre playing the devil with his estate i can tell him but hes a simple old soulrad and a beauty too boys they say the rest of his property is invested in lookingglasses i wonder if hed give a poor devil like me the model of his nose ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye aye sir said steelkilt merry as a cricket lively boys lively now and with that the pump clanged like fifty fireengines the men tossed their hats off to it and ere long that peculiar gasping of the lungs was heard which denotes the fullest tension of lifes utmost energies ,MobyDick or The Whale
quitting the pump at last with the rest of his band the lakeman went forward all panting and sat himself down on the windlass his face fiery red his eyes bloodshot and wiping the profuse sweat from his brow now what cozening fiend it was gentlemen that possessed radney to meddle with such a man in that corporeally exasperated state i know not but so it happened intolerably striding along the deck the mate commanded him to get a broom and sweep down the planks and also a shovel and remove some offensive matters consequent upon allowing a pig to run at large ,MobyDick or The Whale
now gentlemen sweeping a ships deck at sea is a piece of household work which in all times but raging gales is regularly attended to every evening it has been known to be done in the case of ships actually foundering at the time such gentlemen is the inflexibility of seausages and the instinctive love of neatness in seamen some of whom would not willingly drown without first washing their faces but in all vessels this broom business is the prescriptive province of the boys if boys there be aboard besides it was the stronger men in the townho that had been divided into gangs taking turns at the pumps and being the most athletic seaman of them all steelkilt had been regularly assigned captain of one of the gangs consequently he should have been freed from any trivial business not connected with truly nautical duties such being the case with his comrades i mention all these particulars so that you may understand exactly how this affair stood between the two men ,MobyDick or The Whale
but there was more than this the order about the shovel was almost as plainly meant to sting and insult steelkilt as though radney had spat in his face any man who has gone sailor in a whaleship will understand this and all this and doubtless much more the lakeman fully comprehended when the mate uttered his command but as he sat still for a moment and as he steadfastly looked into the mates malignant eye and perceived the stacks of powdercasks heaped up in him and the slowmatch silently burning along towards them as he instinctively saw all this that strange forbearance and unwillingness to stir up the deeper passionateness in any already ireful beinga repugnance most felt when felt at all by really valiant men even when aggrievedthis nameless phantom feeling gentlemen stole over steelkilt ,MobyDick or The Whale
therefore in his ordinary tone only a little broken by the bodily exhaustion he was temporarily in he answered him saying that sweeping the deck was not his business and he would not do it and then without at all alluding to the shovel he pointed to three lads as the customary sweepers who not being billeted at the pumps had done little or nothing all day to this radney replied with an oath in a most domineering and outrageous manner unconditionally reiterating his command meanwhile advancing upon the still seated lakeman with an uplifted coopers club hammer which he had snatched from a cask near by ,MobyDick or The Whale
heated and irritated as he was by his spasmodic toil at the pumps for all his first nameless feeling of forbearance the sweating steelkilt could but ill brook this bearing in the mate but somehow still smothering the conflagration within him without speaking he remained doggedly rooted to his seat till at last the incensed radney shook the hammer within a few inches of his face furiously commanding him to do his bidding ,MobyDick or The Whale
steelkilt rose and slowly retreating round the windlass steadily followed by the mate with his menacing hammer deliberately repeated his intention not to obey seeing however that his forbearance had not the slightest effect by an awful and unspeakable intimation with his twisted hand he warned off the foolish and infatuated man but it was to no purpose and in this way the two went once slowly round the windlass when resolved at last no longer to retreat bethinking him that he had now forborne as much as comported with his humor the lakeman paused on the hatches and thus spoke to the officer ,MobyDick or The Whale
mr radney i will not obey you take that hammer away or look to yourself but the predestinated mate coming still closer to him where the lakeman stood fixed now shook the heavy hammer within an inch of his teeth meanwhile repeating a string of insufferable maledictions retreating not the thousandth part of an inch stabbing him in the eye with the unflinching poniard of his glance steelkilt clenching his right hand behind him and creepingly drawing it back told his persecutor that if the hammer but grazed his cheek he steelkilt would murder him but gentlemen the fool had been branded for the slaughter by the gods immediately the hammer touched the cheek the next instant the lower jaw of the mate was stove in his head he fell on the hatch spouting blood like a whale ,MobyDick or The Whale

i see i see impetuously exclaimed don pedro spilling his chicha upon his silvery ruffles no need to travel the worlds one lima i had thought now that at your temperate north the generations were cold and holy as the hillsbut the story ,MobyDick or The Whale
i left off gentlemen where the lakeman shook the backstay hardly had he done so when he was surrounded by the three junior mates and the four harpooneers who all crowded him to the deck but sliding down the ropes like baleful comets the two canallers rushed into the uproar and sought to drag their man out of it towards the forecastle others of the sailors joined with them in this attempt and a twisted turmoil ensued while standing out of harms way the valiant captain danced up and down with a whalepike calling upon his officers to manhandle that atrocious scoundrel and smoke him along to the quarterdeck at intervals he ran close up to the revolving border of the confusion and prying into the heart of it with his pike sought to prick out the object of his resentment but steelkilt and his desperadoes were too much for them all they succeeded in gaining the forecastle deck where hastily slewing about three or four large casks in a line with the windlass these seaparisians entrenched themselves behind the barricade ,MobyDick or The Whale
steelkilt leaped on the barricade and striding up and down there defied the worst the pistols could do but gave the captain to understand distinctly that his steelkilts death would be the signal for a murderous mutiny on the part of all hands fearing in his heart lest this might prove but too true the captain a little desisted but still commanded the insurgents instantly to return to their duty ,MobyDick or The Whale
sink the ship cried steelkilt aye let her sink not a man of us turns to unless you swear not to raise a ropeyarn against us what say ye men turning to his comrades a fierce cheer was their response ,MobyDick or The Whale
the lakeman now patrolled the barricade all the while keeping his eye on the captain and jerking out such sentences as theseits not our fault we didnt want it i told him to take his hammer away it was boys business he might have known me before this i told him not to prick the buffalo i believe i have broken a finger here against his cursed jaw aint those mincing knives down in the forecastle there men look to those handspikes my hearties captain by god look to yourself say the word dont be a fool forget it all we are ready to turn to treat us decently and were your men but we wont be flogged ,MobyDick or The Whale
look ye now cried the lakeman flinging out his arm towards him there are a few of us here and i am one of them who have shipped for the cruise dye see now as you well know sir we can claim our discharge as soon as the anchor is down so we dont want a row its not our interest we want to be peaceable we are ready to work but we wont be flogged ,MobyDick or The Whale
steelkilt glanced round him a moment and then saidi tell you what it is now captain rather than kill ye and be hung for such a shabby rascal we wont lift a hand against ye unless ye attack us but till you say the word about not flogging us we dont do a hands turn ,MobyDick or The Whale
as the lakemans bare head was just level with the planks the captain and his posse leaped the barricade and rapidly drawing over the slide of the scuttle planted their group of hands upon it and loudly called for the steward to bring the heavy brass padlock belonging to the companionway then opening the slide a little the captain whispered something down the crack closed it and turned the key upon themten in numberleaving on deck some twenty or more who thus far had remained neutral ,MobyDick or The Whale
all night a wideawake watch was kept by all the officers forward and aft especially about the forecastle scuttle and fore hatchway at which last place it was feared the insurgents might emerge after breaking through the bulkhead below but the hours of darkness passed in peace the men who still remained at their duty toiling hard at the pumps whose clinking and clanking at intervals through the dreary night dismally resounded through the ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
at sunrise the captain went forward and knocking on the deck summoned the prisoners to work but with a yell they refused water was then lowered down to them and a couple of handfuls of biscuit were tossed after it when again turning the key upon them and pocketing it the captain returned to the quarterdeck twice every day for three days this was repeated but on the fourth morning a confused wrangling and then a scuffling was heard as the customary summons was delivered and suddenly four men burst up from the forecastle saying they were ready to turn to the fetid closeness of the air and a famishing diet united perhaps to some fears of ultimate retribution had constrained them to surrender at discretion emboldened by this the captain reiterated his demand to the rest but steelkilt shouted up to him a terrific hint to stop his babbling and betake himself where he belonged on the fifth morning three others of the mutineers bolted up into the air from the desperate arms below that sought to restrain them only three were left ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was at this point gentlemen that enraged by the defection of seven of his former associates and stung by the mocking voice that had last hailed him and maddened by his long entombment in a place as black as the bowels of despair it was then that steelkilt proposed to the two canallers thus far apparently of one mind with him to burst out of their hole at the next summoning of the garrison and armed with their keen mincing knives long crescentic heavy implements with a handle at each end run amuck from the bowsprit to the taffrail and if by any devilishness of desperation possible seize the ship for himself he would do this he said whether they joined him or not that was the last night he should spend in that den but the scheme met with no opposition on the part of the other two they swore they were ready for that or for any other mad thing for anything in short but a surrender and what was more they each insisted upon being the first man on deck when the time to make the rush should come but to this their leader as fiercely objected reserving that priority for himself particularly as his two comrades would not yield the one to the other in the matter and both of them could not be first for the ladder would but admit one man at a time and here gentlemen the foul play of these miscreants must come out ,MobyDick or The Whale
upon hearing the frantic project of their leader each in his own separate soul had suddenly lighted it would seem upon the same piece of treachery namely to be foremost in breaking out in order to be the first of the three though the last of the ten to surrender and thereby secure whatever small chance of pardon such conduct might merit but when steelkilt made known his determination still to lead them to the last they in some way by some subtle chemistry of villany mixed their before secret treacheries together and when their leader fell into a doze verbally opened their souls to each other in three sentences and bound the sleeper with cords and gagged him with cords and shrieked out for the captain at midnight ,MobyDick or The Whale
thinking murder at hand and smelling in the dark for the blood he and all his armed mates and harpooneers rushed for the forecastle in a few minutes the scuttle was opened and bound hand and foot the still struggling ringleader was shoved up into the air by his perfidious allies who at once claimed the honor of securing a man who had been fully ripe for murder but all these were collared and dragged along the deck like dead cattle and side by side were seized up into the mizzen rigging like three quarters of meat and there they hung till morning damn ye cried the captain pacing to and fro before them the vultures would not touch ye ye villains ,MobyDick or The Whale
at sunrise he summoned all hands and separating those who had rebelled from those who had taken no part in the mutiny he told the former that he had a good mind to flog them all roundthought upon the whole he would do sohe ought tojustice demanded it but for the present considering their timely surrender he would let them go with a reprimand which he accordingly administered in the vernacular ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as for you ye carrion rogues turning to the three men in the riggingfor you i mean to mince ye up for the trypots and seizing a rope he applied it with all his might to the backs of the two traitors till they yelled no more but lifelessly hung their heads sideways as the two crucified thieves are drawn ,MobyDick or The Whale
for a moment the exhausted mutineer made a tremulous motion of his cramped jaws and then painfully twisting round his head said in a sort of hiss what i say is thisand mind it wellif you flog me i murder you ,MobyDick or The Whale
steelkilt here hissed out something inaudible to all but the captain who to the amazement of all hands started back paced the deck rapidly two or three times and then suddenly throwing down his rope said i wont do itlet him gocut him down dye hear ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as the junior mates were hurrying to execute the order a pale man with a bandaged head arrested themradney the chief mate ever since the blow he had lain in his berth but that morning hearing the tumult on the deck he had crept out and thus far had watched the whole scene such was the state of his mouth that he could hardly speak but mumbling something about his being willing and able to do what the captain dared not attempt he snatched the rope and advanced to his pinioned foe ,MobyDick or The Whale
so i am but take that the mate was in the very act of striking when another hiss stayed his uplifted arm he paused and then pausing no more made good his word spite of steelkilts threat whatever that might have been the three men were then cut down all hands were turned to and sullenly worked by the moody seamen the iron pumps clanged as before ,MobyDick or The Whale
just after dark that day when one watch had retired below a clamor was heard in the forecastle and the two trembling traitors running up besieged the cabin door saying they durst not consort with the crew entreaties cuffs and kicks could not drive them back so at their own instance they were put down in the ships run for salvation still no sign of mutiny reappeared among the rest on the contrary it seemed that mainly at steelkilts instigation they had resolved to maintain the strictest peacefulness obey all orders to the last and when the ship reached port desert her in a body but in order to insure the speediest end to the voyage they all agreed to another thingnamely not to sing out for whales in case any should be discovered for spite of her leak and spite of all her other perils the townho still maintained her mastheads and her captain was just as willing to lower for a fish that moment as on the day his craft first struck the cruising ground and radney the mate was quite as ready to change his berth for a boat and with his bandaged mouth seek to gag in death the vital jaw of the whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
but though the lakeman had induced the seamen to adopt this sort of passiveness in their conduct he kept his own counsel at least till all was over concerning his own proper and private revenge upon the man who had stung him in the ventricles of his heart he was in radney the chief mates watch and as if the infatuated man sought to run more than half way to meet his doom after the scene at the rigging he insisted against the express counsel of the captain upon resuming the head of his watch at night upon this and one or two other circumstances steelkilt systematically built the plan of his revenge ,MobyDick or The Whale
during the night radney had an unseamanlike way of sitting on the bulwarks of the quarterdeck and leaning his arm upon the gunwale of the boat which was hoisted up there a little above the ships side in this attitude it was well known he sometimes dozed there was a considerable vacancy between the boat and the ship and down between this was the sea steelkilt calculated his time and found that his next trick at the helm would come round at two oclock in the morning of the third day from that in which he had been betrayed at his leisure he employed the interval in braiding something very carefully in his watches below ,MobyDick or The Whale
why not do you think he wont do me a turn when its to help himself in the end shipmate and going to the mate he looked at him quietly and asked him for some twine to mend his hammock it was given himneither twine nor lanyard were seen again but the next night an iron ball closely netted partly rolled from the pocket of the lakemans monkey jacket as he was tucking the coat into his hammock for a pillow twentyfour hours after his trick at the silent helmnigh to the man who was apt to doze over the grave always ready dug to the seamans handthat fatal hour was then to come and in the foreordaining soul of steelkilt the mate was already stark and stretched as a corpse with his forehead crushed in ,MobyDick or The Whale
but gentlemen a fool saved the wouldbe murderer from the bloody deed he had planned yet complete revenge he had and without being the avenger for by a mysterious fatality heaven itself seemed to step in to take out of his hands into its own the damning thing he would have done ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was just between daybreak and sunrise of the morning of the second day when they were washing down the decks that a stupid teneriffe man drawing water in the mainchains all at once shouted out there she rolls there she rolls jesu what a whale it was moby dick ,MobyDick or The Whale
no need gentlemen one moment and i proceednow gentlemen so suddenly perceiving the snowy whale within fifty yards of the shipforgetful of the compact among the crewin the excitement of the moment the teneriffe man had instinctively and involuntarily lifted his voice for the monster though for some little time past it had been plainly beheld from the three sullen mastheads all was now a phrensy the white whalethe white whale was the cry from captain mates and harpooneers who undeterred by fearful rumours were all anxious to capture so famous and precious a fish while the dogged crew eyed askance and with curses the appalling beauty of the vast milky mass that lit up by a horizontal spangling sun shifted and glistened like a living opal in the blue morning sea gentlemen a strange fatality pervades the whole career of these events as if verily mapped out before the world itself was charted the mutineer was the bowsman of the mate and when fast to a fish it was his duty to sit next him while radney stood up with his lance in the prow and haul in or slacken the line at the word of command moreover when the four boats were lowered the mates got the start and none howled more fiercely with delight than did steelkilt as he strained at his oar after a stiff pull their harpooneer got fast and spear in hand radney sprang to the bow he was always a furious man it seems in a boat and now his bandaged cry was to beach him on the whales topmost back nothing loath his bowsman hauled him up and up through a blinding foam that blent two whitenesses together till of a sudden the boat struck as against a sunken ledge and keeling over spilled out the standing mate that instant as he fell on the whales slippery back the boat righted and was dashed aside by the swell while radney was tossed over into the sea on the other flank of the whale he struck out through the spray and for an instant was dimly seen through that veil wildly seeking to remove himself from the eye of moby dick but the whale rushed round in a sudden maelstrom seized the swimmer between his jaws and rearing high up with him plunged headlong again and went down ,MobyDick or The Whale
meantime at the first tap of the boats bottom the lakeman had slackened the line so as to drop astern from the whirlpool calmly looking on he thought his own thoughts but a sudden terrific downward jerking of the boat quickly brought his knife to the line he cut it and the whale was free but at some distance moby dick rose again with some tatters of radneys red woollen shirt caught in the teeth that had destroyed him all four boats gave chase again but the whale eluded them and finally wholly disappeared ,MobyDick or The Whale
in good time the townho reached her porta savage solitary placewhere no civilized creature resided there headed by the lakeman all but five or six of the foremastmen deliberately deserted among the palms eventually as it turned out seizing a large double warcanoe of the savages and setting sail for some other harbor ,MobyDick or The Whale
the ships company being reduced to but a handful the captain called upon the islanders to assist him in the laborious business of heaving down the ship to stop the leak but to such unresting vigilance over their dangerous allies was this small band of whites necessitated both by night and by day and so extreme was the hard work they underwent that upon the vessel being ready again for sea they were in such a weakened condition that the captain durst not put off with them in so heavy a vessel after taking counsel with his officers he anchored the ship as far off shore as possible loaded and ran out his two cannon from the bows stacked his muskets on the poop and warning the islanders not to approach the ship at their peril took one man with him and setting the sail of his best whaleboat steered straight before the wind for tahiti five hundred miles distant to procure a reinforcement to his crew ,MobyDick or The Whale
on the fourth day of the sail a large canoe was descried which seemed to have touched at a low isle of corals he steered away from it but the savage craft bore down on him and soon the voice of steelkilt hailed him to heave to or he would run him under water the captain presented a pistol with one foot on each prow of the yoked warcanoes the lakeman laughed him to scorn assuring him that if the pistol so much as clicked in the lock he would bury him in bubbles and foam ,MobyDick or The Whale
cross your arms sir throw back your head now repeat after me as soon as steelkilt leaves me i swear to beach this boat on yonder island and remain there six days if i do not may lightnings strike me ,MobyDick or The Whale
watching the boat till it was fairly beached and drawn up to the roots of the cocoanut trees steelkilt made sail again and in due time arrived at tahiti his own place of destination there luck befriended him two ships were about to sail for france and were providentially in want of precisely that number of men which the sailor headed they embarked and so for ever got the start of their former captain had he been at all minded to work them legal retribution ,MobyDick or The Whale
some ten days after the french ships sailed the whaleboat arrived and the captain was forced to enlist some of the more civilized tahitians who had been somewhat used to the sea chartering a small native schooner he returned with them to his vessel and finding all right there again resumed his cruisings ,MobyDick or The Whale
where steelkilt now is gentlemen none know but upon the island of nantucket the widow of radney still turns to the sea which refuses to give up its dead still in dreams sees the awful white whale that destroyed him      ,MobyDick or The Whale
then i entreat you tell me if to the best of your own convictions this your story is in substance really true it is so passing wonderful did you get it from an unquestionable source bear with me if i seem to press ,MobyDick or The Whale
so help me heaven and on my honor the story i have told ye gentlemen is in substance and its great items true i know it to be true it happened on this ball i trod the ship i knew the crew i have seen and talked with steelkilt since the death of radney ,MobyDick or The Whale
i shall ere long paint to you as well as one can without canvas something like the true form of the whale as he actually appears to the eye of the whaleman when in his own absolute body the whale is moored alongside the whaleship so that he can be fairly stepped upon there it may be worth while therefore previously to advert to those curious imaginary portraits of him which even down to the present day confidently challenge the faith of the landsman it is time to set the world right in this matter by proving such pictures of the whale all wrong ,MobyDick or The Whale
it may be that the primal source of all those pictorial delusions will be found among the oldest hindoo egyptian and grecian sculptures for ever since those inventive but unscrupulous times when on the marble panellings of temples the pedestals of statues and on shields medallions cups and coins the dolphin was drawn in scales of chainarmor like saladins and a helmeted head like st georges ever since then has something of the same sort of license prevailed not only in most popular pictures of the whale but in many scientific presentations of him ,MobyDick or The Whale
now by all odds the most ancient extant portrait anyways purporting to be the whales is to be found in the famous cavernpagoda of elephanta in india the brahmins maintain that in the almost endless sculptures of that immemorial pagoda all the trades and pursuits every conceivable avocation of man were prefigured ages before any of them actually came into being no wonder then that in some sort our noble profession of whaling should have been there shadowed forth the hindoo whale referred to occurs in a separate department of the wall depicting the incarnation of vishnu in the form of leviathan learnedly known as the matse avatar but though this sculpture is half man and half whale so as only to give the tail of the latter yet that small section of him is all wrong it looks more like the tapering tail of an anaconda than the broad palms of the true whales majestic flukes ,MobyDick or The Whale
but go to the old galleries and look now at a great christian painters portrait of this fish for he succeeds no better than the antediluvian hindoo it is guidos picture of perseus rescuing andromeda from the seamonster or whale where did guido get the model of such a strange creature as that nor does hogarth in painting the same scene in his own perseus descending make out one whit better the huge corpulence of that hogarthian monster undulates on the surface scarcely drawing one inch of water it has a sort of howdah on its back and its distended tusked mouth into which the billows are rolling might be taken for the traitors gate leading from the thames by water into the tower then there are the prodromus whales of old scotch sibbald and jonahs whale as depicted in the prints of old bibles and the cuts of old primers what shall be said of these as for the bookbinders whale winding like a vinestalk round the stock of a descending anchoras stamped and gilded on the backs and titlepages of many books both old and newthat is a very picturesque but purely fabulous creature imitated i take it from the like figures on antique vases though universally denominated a dolphin i nevertheless call this bookbinders fish an attempt at a whale because it was so intended when the device was first introduced it was introduced by an old italian publisher somewhere about the th century during the revival of learning and in those days and even down to a comparatively late period dolphins were popularly supposed to be a species of the leviathan ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the vignettes and other embellishments of some ancient books you will at times meet with very curious touches at the whale where all manner of spouts jets deau hot springs and cold saratoga and badenbaden come bubbling up from his unexhausted brain in the titlepage of the original edition of the advancement of learning you will find some curious whales ,MobyDick or The Whale
but quitting all these unprofessional attempts let us glance at those pictures of leviathan purporting to be sober scientific delineations by those who know in old harriss collection of voyages there are some plates of whales extracted from a dutch book of voyages ad  entitled a whaling voyage to spitzbergen in the ship jonas in the whale peter peterson of friesland master in one of those plates the whales like great rafts of logs are represented lying among iceisles with white bears running over their living backs in another plate the prodigious blunder is made of representing the whale with perpendicular flukes ,MobyDick or The Whale
then again there is an imposing quarto written by one captain colnett a post captain in the english navy entitled a voyage round cape horn into the south seas for the purpose of extending the spermaceti whale fisheries in this book is an outline purporting to be a picture of a physeter or spermaceti whale drawn by scale from one killed on the coast of mexico august  and hoisted on deck i doubt not the captain had this veracious picture taken for the benefit of his marines to mention but one thing about it let me say that it has an eye which applied according to the accompanying scale to a full grown sperm whale would make the eye of that whale a bowwindow some five feet long ah my gallant captain why did ye not give us jonah looking out of that eye ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor are the most conscientious compilations of natural history for the benefit of the young and tender free from the same heinousness of mistake look at that popular work goldsmiths animated nature in the abridged london edition of  there are plates of an alleged whale and a narwhale i do not wish to seem inelegant but this unsightly whale looks much like an amputated sow and as for the narwhale one glimpse at it is enough to amaze one that in this nineteenth century such a hippogriff could be palmed for genuine upon any intelligent public of schoolboys ,MobyDick or The Whale
then again in  bernard germain count de lacpde a great naturalist published a scientific systemized whale book wherein are several pictures of the different species of the leviathan all these are not only incorrect but the picture of the mysticetus or greenland whale that is to say the right whale even scoresby a long experienced man as touching that species declares not to have its counterpart in nature ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the placing of the capsheaf to all this blundering business was reserved for the scientific frederick cuvier brother to the famous baron in  he published a natural history of whales in which he gives what he calls a picture of the sperm whale before showing that picture to any nantucketer you had best provide for your summary retreat from nantucket in a word frederick cuviers sperm whale is not a sperm whale but a squash of course he never had the benefit of a whaling voyage such men seldom have but whence he derived that picture who can tell perhaps he got it as his scientific predecessor in the same field desmarest got one of his authentic abortions that is from a chinese drawing and what sort of lively lads with the pencil those chinese are many queer cups and saucers inform us ,MobyDick or The Whale
as for the signpainters whales seen in the streets hanging over the shops of oildealers what shall be said of them they are generally richard iii whales with dromedary humps and very savage breakfasting on three or four sailor tarts that is whaleboats full of mariners their deformities floundering in seas of blood and blue paint ,MobyDick or The Whale
but these manifold mistakes in depicting the whale are not so very surprising after all consider most of the scientific drawings have been taken from the stranded fish and these are about as correct as a drawing of a wrecked ship with broken back would correctly represent the noble animal itself in all its undashed pride of hull and spars though elephants have stood for their fulllengths the living leviathan has never yet fairly floated himself for his portrait the living whale in his full majesty and significance is only to be seen at sea in unfathomable waters and afloat the vast bulk of him is out of sight like a launched lineofbattle ship and out of that element it is a thing eternally impossible for mortal man to hoist him bodily into the air so as to preserve all his mighty swells and undulations and not to speak of the highly presumable difference of contour between a young sucking whale and a fullgrown platonian leviathan yet even in the case of one of those young sucking whales hoisted to a ships deck such is then the outlandish eellike limbered varying shape of him that his precise expression the devil himself could not catch ,MobyDick or The Whale
but it may be fancied that from the naked skeleton of the stranded whale accurate hints may be derived touching his true form not at all for it is one of the more curious things about this leviathan that his skeleton gives very little idea of his general shape though jeremy benthams skeleton which hangs for candelabra in the library of one of his executors correctly conveys the idea of a burlybrowed utilitarian old gentleman with all jeremys other leading personal characteristics yet nothing of this kind could be inferred from any leviathans articulated bones in fact as the great hunter says the mere skeleton of the whale bears the same relation to the fully invested and padded animal as the insect does to the chrysalis that so roundingly envelopes it this peculiarity is strikingly evinced in the head as in some part of this book will be incidentally shown it is also very curiously displayed in the side fin the bones of which almost exactly answer to the bones of the human hand minus only the thumb this fin has four regular bonefingers the index middle ring and little finger but all these are permanently lodged in their fleshy covering as the human fingers in an artificial covering however recklessly the whale may sometimes serve us said humorous stubb one day he can never be truly said to handle us without mittens ,MobyDick or The Whale
for all these reasons then any way you may look at it you must needs conclude that the great leviathan is that one creature in the world which must remain unpainted to the last true one portrait may hit the mark much nearer than another but none can hit it with any very considerable degree of exactness so there is no earthly way of finding out precisely what the whale really looks like and the only mode in which you can derive even a tolerable idea of his living contour is by going a whaling yourself but by so doing you run no small risk of being eternally stove and sunk by him wherefore it seems to me you had best not be too fastidious in your curiosity touching this leviathan ,MobyDick or The Whale
in connexion with the monstrous pictures of whales i am strongly tempted here to enter upon those still more monstrous stories of them which are to be found in certain books both ancient and modern especially in pliny purchas hackluyt harris cuvier etc but i pass that matter by ,MobyDick or The Whale
i know of only four published outlines of the great sperm whale colnetts hugginss frederick cuviers and beales in the previous better than theirs but by great odds beales is the best all beales drawings of this whale are good excepting the middle figure in the picture of three whales in various attitudes capping his second doubt calculated to excite the civil scepticism of some parlor men is admirably correct and lifelike in its general effect some of the sperm whale drawings in j ross browne are pretty correct in contour but they are wretchedly engraved that is not his fault though ,MobyDick or The Whale
of the right whale the best outline pictures are in scoresby but they are drawn on too small a scale to convey a desirable impression he has but one picture of whaling scenes and this is a sad deficiency because it is by such pictures only when at all well done that you can derive anything like a truthful idea of the living whale as seen by his living hunters ,MobyDick or The Whale
but taken for all in all by far the finest though in some details not the most correct presentations of whales and whaling scenes to be anywhere found are two large french engravings well executed and taken from paintings by one garnery respectively they represent attacks on the sperm and right whale in the first engraving a noble sperm whale is depicted in full majesty of might just risen beneath the boat from the profundities of the ocean and bearing high in the air upon his back the terrific wreck of the stoven planks the prow of the boat is partially unbroken and is drawn just balancing upon the monsters spine and standing in that prow for that one single incomputable flash of time you behold an oarsman half shrouded by the incensed boiling spout of the whale and in the act of leaping as if from a precipice the action of the whole thing is wonderfully good and true the halfemptied linetub floats on the whitened sea the wooden poles of the spilled harpoons obliquely bob in it the heads of the swimming crew are scattered about the whale in contrasting expressions of affright while in the black stormy distance the ship is bearing down upon the scene serious fault might be found with the anatomical details of this whale but let that pass since for the life of me i could not draw so good a one ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the second engraving the boat is in the act of drawing alongside the barnacled flank of a large running right whale that rolls his black weedy bulk in the sea like some mossy rockslide from the patagonian cliffs his jets are erect full and black like soot so that from so abounding a smoke in the chimney you would think there must be a brave supper cooking in the great bowels below sea fowls are pecking at the small crabs shellfish and other sea candies and maccaroni which the right whale sometimes carries on his pestilent back and all the while the thicklipped leviathan is rushing through the deep leaving tons of tumultuous white curds in his wake and causing the slight boat to rock in the swells like a skiff caught nigh the paddlewheels of an ocean steamer thus the foreground is all raging commotion but behind in admirable artistic contrast is the glassy level of a sea becalmed the drooping unstarched sails of the powerless ship and the inert mass of a dead whale a conquered fortress with the flag of capture lazily hanging from the whalepole inserted into his spouthole ,MobyDick or The Whale
who garnery the painter is or was i know not but my life for it he was either practically conversant with his subject or else marvellously tutored by some experienced whaleman the french are the lads for painting action go and gaze upon all the paintings of europe and where will you find such a gallery of living and breathing commotion on canvas as in that triumphal hall at versailles where the beholder fights his way pellmell through the consecutive great battles of france where every sword seems a flash of the northern lights and the successive armed kings and emperors dash by like a charge of crowned centaurs not wholly unworthy of a place in that gallery are these sea battlepieces of garnery ,MobyDick or The Whale
the natural aptitude of the french for seizing the picturesqueness of things seems to be peculiarly evinced in what paintings and engravings they have of their whaling scenes with not one tenth of englands experience in the fishery and not the thousandth part of that of the americans they have nevertheless furnished both nations with the only finished sketches at all capable of conveying the real spirit of the whale hunt for the most part the english and american whale draughtsmen seem entirely content with presenting the mechanical outline of things such as the vacant profile of the whale which so far as picturesqueness of effect is concerned is about tantamount to sketching the profile of a pyramid even scoresby the justly renowned right whaleman after giving us a stiff full length of the greenland whale and three or four delicate miniatures of narwhales and porpoises treats us to a series of classical engravings of boat hooks chopping knives and grapnels and with the microscopic diligence of a leuwenhoeck submits to the inspection of a shivering world ninetysix facsimiles of magnified arctic snow crystals i mean no disparagement to the excellent voyager i honor him for a veteran but in so important a matter it was certainly an oversight not to have procured for every crystal a sworn affidavit taken before a greenland justice of the peace ,MobyDick or The Whale
in addition to those fine engravings from garnery there are two other french engravings worthy of note by some one who subscribes himself h durand one of them though not precisely adapted to our present purpose nevertheless deserves mention on other accounts it is a quiet noonscene among the isles of the pacific a french whaler anchored inshore in a calm and lazily taking water on board the loosened sails of the ship and the long leaves of the palms in the background both drooping together in the breezeless air the effect is very fine when considered with reference to its presenting the hardy fishermen under one of their few aspects of oriental repose the other engraving is quite a different affair the ship hoveto upon the open sea and in the very heart of the leviathanic life with a right whale alongside the vessel in the act of cuttingin hove over to the monster as if to a quay and a boat hurriedly pushing off from this scene of activity is about giving chase to whales in the distance the harpoons and lances lie levelled for use three oarsmen are just setting the mast in its hole while from a sudden roll of the sea the little craft stands halferect out of the water like a rearing horse from the ship the smoke of the torments of the boiling whale is going up like the smoke over a village of smithies and to windward a black cloud rising up with earnest of squalls and rains seems to quicken the activity of the excited seamen ,MobyDick or The Whale
on towerhill as you go down to the london docks you may have seen a crippled beggar or kedger as the sailors say holding a painted board before him representing the tragic scene in which he lost his leg there are three whales and three boats and one of the boats presumed to contain the missing leg in all its original integrity is being crunched by the jaws of the foremost whale any time these ten years they tell me has that man held up that picture and exhibited that stump to an incredulous world but the time of his justification has now come his three whales are as good whales as were ever published in wapping at any rate and his stump as unquestionable a stump as any you will find in the western clearings but though for ever mounted on that stump never a stumpspeech does the poor whaleman make but with downcast eyes stands ruefully contemplating his own amputation ,MobyDick or The Whale
throughout the pacific and also in nantucket and new bedford and sag harbor you will come across lively sketches of whales and whalingscenes graven by the fishermen themselves on sperm whaleteeth or ladies busks wrought out of the right whalebone and other like skrimshander articles as the whalemen call the numerous little ingenious contrivances they elaborately carve out of the rough material in their hours of ocean leisure some of them have little boxes of dentisticallooking implements specially intended for the skrimshandering business but in general they toil with their jackknives alone and with that almost omnipotent tool of the sailor they will turn you out anything you please in the way of a mariners fancy ,MobyDick or The Whale
long exile from christendom and civilization inevitably restores a man to that condition in which god placed him ie what is called savagery your true whalehunter is as much a savage as an iroquois i myself am a savage owning no allegiance but to the king of the cannibals and ready at any moment to rebel against him ,MobyDick or The Whale
now one of the peculiar characteristics of the savage in his domestic hours is his wonderful patience of industry an ancient hawaiian warclub or spearpaddle in its full multiplicity and elaboration of carving is as great a trophy of human perseverance as a latin lexicon for with but a bit of broken seashell or a sharks tooth that miraculous intricacy of wooden network has been achieved and it has cost steady years of steady application ,MobyDick or The Whale
as with the hawaiian savage so with the white sailorsavage with the same marvellous patience and with the same single sharks tooth of his one poor jackknife he will carve you a bit of bone sculpture not quite as workmanlike but as close packed in its maziness of design as the greek savage achilless shield and full of barbaric spirit and suggestiveness as the prints of that fine old dutch savage albert durer ,MobyDick or The Whale
wooden whales or whales cut in profile out of the small dark slabs of the noble south sea warwood are frequently met with in the forecastles of american whalers some of them are done with much accuracy ,MobyDick or The Whale
at some old gableroofed country houses you will see brass whales hung by the tail for knockers to the roadside door when the porter is sleepy the anvilheaded whale would be best but these knocking whales are seldom remarkable as faithful essays on the spires of some oldfashioned churches you will see sheetiron whales placed there for weathercocks but they are so elevated and besides that are to all intents and purposes so labelled with hands off you cannot examine them closely enough to decide upon their merit ,MobyDick or The Whale
in bony ribby regions of the earth where at the base of high broken cliffs masses of rock lie strewn in fantastic groupings upon the plain you will often discover images as of the petrified forms of the leviathan partly merged in grass which of a windy day breaks against them in a surf of green surges ,MobyDick or The Whale
then again in mountainous countries where the traveller is continually girdled by amphitheatrical heights here and there from some lucky point of view you will catch passing glimpses of the profiles of whales defined along the undulating ridges but you must be a thorough whaleman to see these sights and not only that but if you wish to return to such a sight again you must be sure and take the exact intersecting latitude and longitude of your first standpoint else so chancelike are such observations of the hills that your precise previous standpoint would require a laborious rediscovery like the soloma islands which still remain incognita though once highruffed mendanna trod them and old figuera chronicled them ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor when expandingly lifted by your subject can you fail to trace out great whales in the starry heavens and boats in pursuit of them as when long filled with thoughts of war the eastern nations saw armies locked in battle among the clouds thus at the north have i chased leviathan round and round the pole with the revolutions of the bright points that first defined him to me and beneath the effulgent antarctic skies i have boarded the argonavis and joined the chase against the starry cetus far beyond the utmost stretch of hydrus and the flying fish ,MobyDick or The Whale
with a frigates anchors for my bridlebitts and fasces of harpoons for spurs would i could mount that whale and leap the topmost skies to see whether the fabled heavens with all their countless tents really lie encamped beyond my mortal sight ,MobyDick or The Whale
steering northeastward from the crozetts we fell in with vast meadows of brit the minute yellow substance upon which the right whale largely feeds for leagues and leagues it undulated round us so that we seemed to be sailing through boundless fields of ripe and golden wheat ,MobyDick or The Whale
on the second day numbers of right whales were seen who secure from the attack of a sperm whaler like the pequod with open jaws sluggishly swam through the brit which adhering to the fringing fibres of that wondrous venetian blind in their mouths was in that manner separated from the water that escaped at the lip ,MobyDick or The Whale
as morning mowers who side by side slowly and seethingly advance their scythes through the long wet grass of marshy meads even so these monsters swam making a strange grassy cutting sound and leaving behind them endless swaths of blue upon the yellow sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
that part of the sea known among whalemen as the brazil banks does not bear that name as the banks of newfoundland do because of there being shallows and soundings there but because of this remarkable meadowlike appearance caused by the vast drifts of brit continually floating in those latitudes where the right whale is often chased ,MobyDick or The Whale
but it was only the sound they made as they parted the brit which at all reminded one of mowers seen from the mastheads especially when they paused and were stationary for a while their vast black forms looked more like lifeless masses of rock than anything else and as in the great hunting countries of india the stranger at a distance will sometimes pass on the plains recumbent elephants without knowing them to be such taking them for bare blackened elevations of the soil even so often with him who for the first time beholds this species of the leviathans of the sea and even when recognised at last their immense magnitude renders it very hard really to believe that such bulky masses of overgrowth can possibly be instinct in all parts with the same sort of life that lives in a dog or a horse ,MobyDick or The Whale
indeed in other respects you can hardly regard any creatures of the deep with the same feelings that you do those of the shore for though some old naturalists have maintained that all creatures of the land are of their kind in the sea and though taking a broad general view of the thing this may very well be yet coming to specialties where for example does the ocean furnish any fish that in disposition answers to the sagacious kindness of the dog the accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him ,MobyDick or The Whale
but though to landsmen in general the native inhabitants of the seas have ever been regarded with emotions unspeakably unsocial and repelling though we know the sea to be an everlasting terra incognita so that columbus sailed over numberless unknown worlds to discover his one superficial western one though by vast odds the most terrific of all mortal disasters have immemorially and indiscriminately befallen tens and hundreds of thousands of those who have gone upon the waters though but a moments consideration will teach that however baby man may brag of his science and skill and however much in a flattering future that science and skill may augment yet for ever and for ever to the crack of doom the sea will insult and murder him and pulverize the stateliest stiffest frigate he can make nevertheless by the continual repetition of these very impressions man has lost that sense of the full awfulness of the sea which aboriginally belongs to it ,MobyDick or The Whale
the first boat we read of floated on an ocean that with portuguese vengeance had whelmed a whole world without leaving so much as a widow that same ocean rolls now that same ocean destroyed the wrecked ships of last year yea foolish mortals noahs flood is not yet subsided two thirds of the fair world it yet covers ,MobyDick or The Whale
wherein differ the sea and the land that a miracle upon one is not a miracle upon the other preternatural terrors rested upon the hebrews when under the feet of korah and his company the live ground opened and swallowed them up for ever yet not a modern sun ever sets but in precisely the same manner the live sea swallows up ships and crews ,MobyDick or The Whale
but not only is the sea such a foe to man who is an alien to it but it is also a fiend to its own offspring worse than the persian host who murdered his own guests sparing not the creatures which itself hath spawned like a savage tigress that tossing in the jungle overlays her own cubs so the sea dashes even the mightiest whales against the rocks and leaves them there side by side with the split wrecks of ships no mercy no power but its own controls it panting and snorting like a mad battle steed that has lost its rider the masterless ocean overruns the globe ,MobyDick or The Whale
consider the subtleness of the sea how its most dreaded creatures glide under water unapparent for the most part and treacherously hidden beneath the loveliest tints of azure consider also the devilish brilliance and beauty of many of its most remorseless tribes as the dainty embellished shape of many species of sharks consider once more the universal cannibalism of the sea all whose creatures prey upon each other carrying on eternal war since the world began ,MobyDick or The Whale
consider all this and then turn to this green gentle and most docile earth consider them both the sea and the land and do you not find a strange analogy to something in yourself for as this appalling ocean surrounds the verdant land so in the soul of man there lies one insular tahiti full of peace and joy but encompassed by all the horrors of the half known life god keep thee push not off from that isle thou canst never return ,MobyDick or The Whale
slowly wading through the meadows of brit the pequod still held on her way northeastward towards the island of java a gentle air impelling her keel so that in the surrounding serenity her three tall tapering masts mildly waved to that languid breeze as three mild palms on a plain and still at wide intervals in the silvery night the lonely alluring jet would be seen ,MobyDick or The Whale
but one transparent blue morning when a stillness almost preternatural spread over the sea however unattended with any stagnant calm when the long burnished sunglade on the waters seemed a golden finger laid across them enjoining some secrecy when the slippered waves whispered together as they softly ran on in this profound hush of the visible sphere a strange spectre was seen by daggoo from the mainmasthead ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the distance a great white mass lazily rose and rising higher and higher and disentangling itself from the azure at last gleamed before our prow like a snowslide new slid from the hills thus glistening for a moment as slowly it subsided and sank then once more arose and silently gleamed it seemed not a whale and yet is this moby dick thought daggoo again the phantom went down but on reappearing once more with a stilettolike cry that startled every man from his nod the negro yelled outthere there again there she breaches right ahead the white whale the white whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
upon this the seamen rushed to the yardarms as in swarmingtime the bees rush to the boughs bareheaded in the sultry sun ahab stood on the bowsprit and with one hand pushed far behind in readiness to wave his orders to the helmsman cast his eager glance in the direction indicated aloft by the outstretched motionless arm of daggoo ,MobyDick or The Whale
whether the flitting attendance of the one still and solitary jet had gradually worked upon ahab so that he was now prepared to connect the ideas of mildness and repose with the first sight of the particular whale he pursued however this was or whether his eagerness betrayed him whichever way it might have been no sooner did he distinctly perceive the white mass than with a quick intensity he instantly gave orders for lowering ,MobyDick or The Whale
the four boats were soon on the water ahabs in advance and all swiftly pulling towards their prey soon it went down and while with oars suspended we were awaiting its reappearance lo in the same spot where it sank once more it slowly rose almost forgetting for the moment all thoughts of moby dick we now gazed at the most wondrous phenomenon which the secret seas have hitherto revealed to mankind a vast pulpy mass furlongs in length and breadth of a glancing creamcolour lay floating on the water innumerable long arms radiating from its centre and curling and twisting like a nest of anacondas as if blindly to clutch at any hapless object within reach no perceptible face or front did it have no conceivable token of either sensation or instinct but undulated there on the billows an unearthly formless chancelike apparition of life ,MobyDick or The Whale
as with a low sucking sound it slowly disappeared again starbuck still gazing at the agitated waters where it had sunk with a wild voice exclaimedalmost rather had i seen moby dick and fought him than to have seen thee thou white ghost ,MobyDick or The Whale
whatever superstitions the sperm whalemen in general have connected with the sight of this object certain it is that a glimpse of it being so very unusual that circumstance has gone far to invest it with portentousness so rarely is it beheld that though one and all of them declare it to be the largest animated thing in the ocean yet very few of them have any but the most vague ideas concerning its true nature and form notwithstanding they believe it to furnish to the sperm whale his only food for though other species of whales find their food above water and may be seen by man in the act of feeding the spermaceti whale obtains his whole food in unknown zones below the surface and only by inference is it that any one can tell of what precisely that food consists at times when closely pursued he will disgorge what are supposed to be the detached arms of the squid some of them thus exhibited exceeding twenty and thirty feet in length they fancy that the monster to which these arms belonged ordinarily clings by them to the bed of the ocean and that the sperm whale unlike other species is supplied with teeth in order to attack and tear it ,MobyDick or The Whale
there seems some ground to imagine that the great kraken of bishop pontoppodan may ultimately resolve itself into squid the manner in which the bishop describes it as alternately rising and sinking with some other particulars he narrates in all this the two correspond but much abatement is necessary with respect to the incredible bulk he assigns it ,MobyDick or The Whale
by some naturalists who have vaguely heard rumors of the mysterious creature here spoken of it is included among the class of cuttlefish to which indeed in certain external respects it would seem to belong but only as the anak of the tribe ,MobyDick or The Whale
the line originally used in the fishery was of the best hemp slightly vapored with tar not impregnated with it as in the case of ordinary ropes for while tar as ordinarily used makes the hemp more pliable to the ropemaker and also renders the rope itself more convenient to the sailor for common ship use yet not only would the ordinary quantity too much stiffen the whaleline for the close coiling to which it must be subjected but as most seamen are beginning to learn tar in general by no means adds to the ropes durability or strength however much it may give it compactness and gloss ,MobyDick or The Whale
of late years the manilla rope has in the american fishery almost entirely superseded hemp as a material for whalelines for though not so durable as hemp it is stronger and far more soft and elastic and i will add since there is an sthetics in all things is much more handsome and becoming to the boat than hemp hemp is a dusky dark fellow a sort of indian but manilla is as a goldenhaired circassian to behold ,MobyDick or The Whale
the whaleline is only twothirds of an inch in thickness at first sight you would not think it so strong as it really is by experiment its one and fifty yarns will each suspend a weight of one hundred and twenty pounds so that the whole rope will bear a strain nearly equal to three tons in length the common sperm whaleline measures something over two hundred fathoms towards the stern of the boat it is spirally coiled away in the tub not like the wormpipe of a still though but so as to form one round cheeseshaped mass of densely bedded sheaves or layers of concentric spiralizations without any hollow but the heart or minute vertical tube formed at the axis of the cheese as the least tangle or kink in the coiling would in running out infallibly take somebodys arm leg or entire body off the utmost precaution is used in stowing the line in its tub some harpooneers will consume almost an entire morning in this business carrying the line high aloft and then reeving it downwards through a block towards the tub so as in the act of coiling to free it from all possible wrinkles and twists ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the english boats two tubs are used instead of one the same line being continuously coiled in both tubs there is some advantage in this because these twintubs being so small they fit more readily into the boat and do not strain it so much whereas the american tub nearly three feet in diameter and of proportionate depth makes a rather bulky freight for a craft whose planks are but one halfinch in thickness for the bottom of the whaleboat is like critical ice which will bear up a considerable distributed weight but not very much of a concentrated one when the painted canvas cover is clapped on the american linetub the boat looks as if it were pulling off with a prodigious great weddingcake to present to the whales ,MobyDick or The Whale
both ends of the line are exposed the lower end terminating in an eyesplice or loop coming up from the bottom against the side of the tub and hanging over its edge completely disengaged from everything this arrangement of the lower end is necessary on two accounts first in order to facilitate the fastening to it of an additional line from a neighboring boat in case the stricken whale should sound so deep as to threaten to carry off the entire line originally attached to the harpoon in these instances the whale of course is shifted like a mug of ale as it were from the one boat to the other though the first boat always hovers at hand to assist its consort second this arrangement is indispensable for common safetys sake for were the lower end of the line in any way attached to the boat and were the whale then to run the line out to the end almost in a single smoking minute as he sometimes does he would not stop there for the doomed boat would infallibly be dragged down after him into the profundity of the sea and in that case no towncrier would ever find her again ,MobyDick or The Whale
before lowering the boat for the chase the upper end of the line is taken aft from the tub and passing round the loggerhead there is again carried forward the entire length of the boat resting crosswise upon the loom or handle of every mans oar so that it jogs against his wrist in rowing and also passing between the men as they alternately sit at the opposite gunwales to the leaded chocks or grooves in the extreme pointed prow of the boat where a wooden pin or skewer the size of a common quill prevents it from slipping out from the chocks it hangs in a slight festoon over the bows and is then passed inside the boat again and some ten or twenty fathoms called boxline being coiled upon the box in the bows it continues its way to the gunwale still a little further aft and is then attached to the shortwarpthe rope which is immediately connected with the harpoon but previous to that connexion the shortwarp goes through sundry mystifications too tedious to detail ,MobyDick or The Whale
thus the whaleline folds the whole boat in its complicated coils twisting and writhing around it in almost every direction all the oarsmen are involved in its perilous contortions so that to the timid eye of the landsman they seem as indian jugglers with the deadliest snakes sportively festooning their limbs nor can any son of mortal woman for the first time seat himself amid those hempen intricacies and while straining his utmost at the oar bethink him that at any unknown instant the harpoon may be darted and all these horrible contortions be put in play like ringed lightnings he cannot be thus circumstanced without a shudder that makes the very marrow in his bones to quiver in him like a shaken jelly yet habitstrange thing what cannot habit accomplishgayer sallies more merry mirth better jokes and brighter repartees you never heard over your mahogany than you will hear over the halfinch white cedar of the whaleboat when thus hung in hangmans nooses and like the six burghers of calais before king edward the six men composing the crew pull into the jaws of death with a halter around every neck as you may say ,MobyDick or The Whale
perhaps a very little thought will now enable you to account for those repeated whaling disasterssome few of which are casually chronicledof this man or that man being taken out of the boat by the line and lost for when the line is darting out to be seated then in the boat is like being seated in the midst of the manifold whizzings of a steamengine in full play when every flying beam and shaft and wheel is grazing you it is worse for you cannot sit motionless in the heart of these perils because the boat is rocking like a cradle and you are pitched one way and the other without the slightest warning and only by a certain selfadjusting buoyancy and simultaneousness of volition and action can you escape being made a mazeppa of and run away with where the allseeing sun himself could never pierce you out ,MobyDick or The Whale
again as the profound calm which only apparently precedes and prophesies of the storm is perhaps more awful than the storm itself for indeed the calm is but the wrapper and envelope of the storm and contains it in itself as the seemingly harmless rifle holds the fatal powder and the ball and the explosion so the graceful repose of the line as it silently serpentines about the oarsmen before being brought into actual playthis is a thing which carries more of true terror than any other aspect of this dangerous affair but why say more all men live enveloped in whalelines all are born with halters round their necks but it is only when caught in the swift sudden turn of death that mortals realize the silent subtle everpresent perils of life and if you be a philosopher though seated in the whaleboat you would not at heart feel one whit more of terror than though seated before your evening fire with a poker and not a harpoon by your side ,MobyDick or The Whale
the next day was exceedingly still and sultry and with nothing special to engage them the pequods crew could hardly resist the spell of sleep induced by such a vacant sea for this part of the indian ocean through which we then were voyaging is not what whalemen call a lively ground that is it affords fewer glimpses of porpoises dolphins flyingfish and other vivacious denizens of more stirring waters than those off the rio de la plata or the inshore ground off peru ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was my turn to stand at the foremasthead and with my shoulders leaning against the slackened royal shrouds to and fro i idly swayed in what seemed an enchanted air no resolution could withstand it in that dreamy mood losing all consciousness at last my soul went out of my body though my body still continued to sway as a pendulum will long after the power which first moved it is withdrawn ,MobyDick or The Whale
ere forgetfulness altogether came over me i had noticed that the seamen at the main and mizzenmastheads were already drowsy so that at last all three of us lifelessly swung from the spars and for every swing that we made there was a nod from below from the slumbering helmsman the waves too nodded their indolent crests and across the wide trance of the sea east nodded to west and the sun over all ,MobyDick or The Whale
suddenly bubbles seemed bursting beneath my closed eyes like vices my hands grasped the shrouds some invisible gracious agency preserved me with a shock i came back to life and lo close under our lee not forty fathoms off a gigantic sperm whale lay rolling in the water like the capsized hull of a frigate his broad glossy back of an ethiopian hue glistening in the suns rays like a mirror but lazily undulating in the trough of the sea and ever and anon tranquilly spouting his vapory jet the whale looked like a portly burgher smoking his pipe of a warm afternoon but that pipe poor whale was thy last as if struck by some enchanters wand the sleepy ship and every sleeper in it all at once started into wakefulness and more than a score of voices from all parts of the vessel simultaneously with the three notes from aloft shouted forth the accustomed cry as the great fish slowly and regularly spouted the sparkling brine into the air ,MobyDick or The Whale
the sudden exclamations of the crew must have alarmed the whale and ere the boats were down majestically turning he swam away to the leeward but with such a steady tranquillity and making so few ripples as he swam that thinking after all he might not as yet be alarmed ahab gave orders that not an oar should be used and no man must speak but in whispers so seated like ontario indians on the gunwales of the boats we swiftly but silently paddled along the calm not admitting of the noiseless sails being set presently as we thus glided in chase the monster perpendicularly flitted his tail forty feet into the air and then sank out of sight like a tower swallowed up ,MobyDick or The Whale
there go flukes was the cry an announcement immediately followed by stubbs producing his match and igniting his pipe for now a respite was granted after the full interval of his sounding had elapsed the whale rose again and being now in advance of the smokers boat and much nearer to it than to any of the others stubb counted upon the honor of the capture it was obvious now that the whale had at length become aware of his pursuers all silence of cautiousness was therefore no longer of use paddles were dropped and oars came loudly into play and still puffing at his pipe stubb cheered on his crew to the assault ,MobyDick or The Whale
it will be seen in some other place of what a very light substance the entire interior of the sperm whales enormous head consists though apparently the most massive it is by far the most buoyant part about him so that with ease he elevates it in the air and invariably does so when going at his utmost speed besides such is the breadth of the upper part of the front of his head and such the tapering cutwater formation of the lower part that by obliquely elevating his head he thereby may be said to transform himself from a bluffbowed sluggish galliot into a sharppointed new york pilotboat ,MobyDick or The Whale
start her start her my men dont hurry yourselves take plenty of timebut start her start her like thunderclaps thats all cried stubb spluttering out the smoke as he spoke start her now give em the long and strong stroke tashtego start her tash my boystart her all but keep cool keep coolcucumbers is the wordeasy easyonly start her like grim death and grinning devils and raise the buried dead perpendicular out of their graves boysthats all start her ,MobyDick or The Whale
woohoo wahee screamed the gayheader in reply raising some old warwhoop to the skies as every oarsman in the strained boat involuntarily bounced forward with the one tremendous leading stroke which the eager indian gave ,MobyDick or The Whale
kala kooloo howled queequeg as if smacking his lips over a mouthful of grenadiers steak and thus with oars and yells the keels cut the sea meanwhile stubb retaining his place in the van still encouraged his men to the onset all the while puffing the smoke from his mouth like desperadoes they tugged and they strained till the welcome cry was heardstand up tashtegogive it to him the harpoon was hurled stern all the oarsmen backed water the same moment something went hot and hissing along every one of their wrists it was the magical line an instant before stubb had swiftly caught two additional turns with it round the loggerhead whence by reason of its increased rapid circlings a hempen blue smoke now jetted up and mingled with the steady fumes from his pipe as the line passed round and round the loggerhead so also just before reaching that point it blisteringly passed through and through both of stubbs hands from which the handcloths or squares of quilted canvas sometimes worn at these times had accidentally dropped it was like holding an enemys sharp twoedged sword by the blade and that enemy all the time striving to wrest it out of your clutch ,MobyDick or The Whale
wet the line wet the line cried stubb to the tub oarsman him seated by the tub who snatching off his hat dashed seawater into it more turns were taken so that the line began holding its place the boat now flew through the boiling water like a shark all fins stubb and tashtego here changed placesstem for sterna staggering business truly in that rocking commotion ,MobyDick or The Whale
partly to show the indispensableness of this act it may here be stated that in the old dutch fishery a mop was used to dash the running line with water in many other ships a wooden piggin or bailer is set apart for that purpose your hat however is the most convenient ,MobyDick or The Whale
from the vibrating line extending the entire length of the upper part of the boat and from its now being more tight than a harpstring you would have thought the craft had two keelsone cleaving the water the other the airas the boat churned on through both opposing elements at once a continual cascade played at the bows a ceaseless whirling eddy in her wake and at the slightest motion from within even but of a little finger the vibrating cracking craft canted over her spasmodic gunwale into the sea thus they rushed each man with might and main clinging to his seat to prevent being tossed to the foam and the tall form of tashtego at the steering oar crouching almost double in order to bring down his centre of gravity whole atlantics and pacifics seemed passed as they shot on their way till at length the whale somewhat slackened his flight ,MobyDick or The Whale
haul inhaul in cried stubb to the bowsman and facing round towards the whale all hands began pulling the boat up to him while yet the boat was being towed on soon ranging up by his flank stubb firmly planting his knee in the clumsy cleat darted dart after dart into the flying fish at the word of command the boat alternately sterning out of the way of the whales horrible wallow and then ranging up for another fling ,MobyDick or The Whale
the red tide now poured from all sides of the monster like brooks down a hill his tormented body rolled not in brine but in blood which bubbled and seethed for furlongs behind in their wake the slanting sun playing upon this crimson pond in the sea sent back its reflection into every face so that they all glowed to each other like red men and all the while jet after jet of white smoke was agonizingly shot from the spiracle of the whale and vehement puff after puff from the mouth of the excited headsman as at every dart hauling in upon his crooked lance by the line attached to it stubb straightened it again and again by a few rapid blows against the gunwale then again and again sent it into the whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
pull uppull up he now cried to the bowsman as the waning whale relaxed in his wrath pull upclose to and the boat ranged along the fishs flank when reaching far over the bow stubb slowly churned his long sharp lance into the fish and kept it there carefully churning and churning as if cautiously seeking to feel after some gold watch that the whale might have swallowed and which he was fearful of breaking ere he could hook it out but that gold watch he sought was the innermost life of the fish and now it is struck for starting from his trance into that unspeakable thing called his flurry the monster horribly wallowed in his blood overwrapped himself in impenetrable mad boiling spray so that the imperilled craft instantly dropping astern had much ado blindly to struggle out from that phrensied twilight into the clear air of the day ,MobyDick or The Whale
and now abating in his flurry the whale once more rolled out into view surging from side to side spasmodically dilating and contracting his spouthole with sharp cracking agonized respirations at last gush after gush of clotted red gore as if it had been the purple lees of red wine shot into the frighted air and falling back again ran dripping down his motionless flanks into the sea his heart had burst ,MobyDick or The Whale
according to the invariable usage of the fishery the whaleboat pushes off from the ship with the headsman or whalekiller as temporary steersman and the harpooneer or whalefastener pulling the foremost oar the one known as the harpooneeroar now it needs a strong nervous arm to strike the first iron into the fish for often in what is called a long dart the heavy implement has to be flung to the distance of twenty or thirty feet but however prolonged and exhausting the chase the harpooneer is expected to pull his oar meanwhile to the uttermost indeed he is expected to set an example of superhuman activity to the rest not only by incredible rowing but by repeated loud and intrepid exclamations and what it is to keep shouting at the top of ones compass while all the other muscles are strained and half startedwhat that is none know but those who have tried it for one i cannot bawl very heartily and work very recklessly at one and the same time in this straining bawling state then with his back to the fish all at once the exhausted harpooneer hears the exciting crystand up and give it to him he now has to drop and secure his oar turn round on his centre half way seize his harpoon from the crotch and with what little strength may remain he essays to pitch it somehow into the whale no wonder taking the whole fleet of whalemen in a body that out of fifty fair chances for a dart not five are successful no wonder that so many hapless harpooneers are madly cursed and disrated no wonder that some of them actually burst their bloodvessels in the boat no wonder that some sperm whalemen are absent four years with four barrels no wonder that to many ship owners whaling is but a losing concern for it is the harpooneer that makes the voyage and if you take the breath out of his body how can you expect to find it there when most wanted ,MobyDick or The Whale
again if the dart be successful then at the second critical instant that is when the whale starts to run the boatheader and harpooneer likewise start to running fore and aft to the imminent jeopardy of themselves and every one else it is then they change places and the headsman the chief officer of the little craft takes his proper station in the bows of the boat ,MobyDick or The Whale
now i care not who maintains the contrary but all this is both foolish and unnecessary the headsman should stay in the bows from first to last he should both dart the harpoon and the lance and no rowing whatever should be expected of him except under circumstances obvious to any fisherman i know that this would sometimes involve a slight loss of speed in the chase but long experience in various whalemen of more than one nation has convinced me that in the vast majority of failures in the fishery it has not by any means been so much the speed of the whale as the before described exhaustion of the harpooneer that has caused them ,MobyDick or The Whale
the crotch alluded to on a previous page deserves independent mention it is a notched stick of a peculiar form some two feet in length which is perpendicularly inserted into the starboard gunwale near the bow for the purpose of furnishing a rest for the wooden extremity of the harpoon whose other naked barbed end slopingly projects from the prow thereby the weapon is instantly at hand to its hurler who snatches it up as readily from its rest as a backwoodsman swings his rifle from the wall it is customary to have two harpoons reposing in the crotch respectively called the first and second irons ,MobyDick or The Whale
but these two harpoons each by its own cord are both connected with the line the object being this to dart them both if possible one instantly after the other into the same whale so that if in the coming drag one should draw out the other may still retain a hold it is a doubling of the chances but it very often happens that owing to the instantaneous violent convulsive running of the whale upon receiving the first iron it becomes impossible for the harpooneer however lightninglike in his movements to pitch the second iron into him nevertheless as the second iron is already connected with the line and the line is running hence that weapon must at all events be anticipatingly tossed out of the boat somehow and somewhere else the most terrible jeopardy would involve all hands tumbled into the water it accordingly is in such cases the spare coils of box line mentioned in a preceding chapter making this feat in most instances prudently practicable but this critical act is not always unattended with the saddest and most fatal casualties ,MobyDick or The Whale
furthermore you must know that when the second iron is thrown overboard it thenceforth becomes a dangling sharpedged terror skittishly curvetting about both boat and whale entangling the lines or cutting them and making a prodigious sensation in all directions nor in general is it possible to secure it again until the whale is fairly captured and a corpse ,MobyDick or The Whale
consider now how it must be in the case of four boats all engaging one unusually strong active and knowing whale when owing to these qualities in him as well as to the thousand concurring accidents of such an audacious enterprise eight or ten loose second irons may be simultaneously dangling about him for of course each boat is supplied with several harpoons to bend on to the line should the first one be ineffectually darted without recovery all these particulars are faithfully narrated here as they will not fail to elucidate several most important however intricate passages in scenes hereafter to be painted ,MobyDick or The Whale
stubbs whale had been killed some distance from the ship it was a calm so forming a tandem of three boats we commenced the slow business of towing the trophy to the pequod and now as we eighteen men with our thirtysix arms and one hundred and eighty thumbs and fingers slowly toiled hour after hour upon that inert sluggish corpse in the sea and it seemed hardly to budge at all except at long intervals good evidence was hereby furnished of the enormousness of the mass we moved for upon the great canal of hangho or whatever they call it in china four or five laborers on the footpath will draw a bulky freighted junk at the rate of a mile an hour but this grand argosy we towed heavily forged along as if laden with piglead in bulk ,MobyDick or The Whale
darkness came on but three lights up and down in the pequods mainrigging dimly guided our way till drawing nearer we saw ahab dropping one of several more lanterns over the bulwarks vacantly eyeing the heaving whale for a moment he issued the usual orders for securing it for the night and then handing his lantern to a seaman went his way into the cabin and did not come forward again until morning ,MobyDick or The Whale
though in overseeing the pursuit of this whale captain ahab had evinced his customary activity to call it so yet now that the creature was dead some vague dissatisfaction or impatience or despair seemed working in him as if the sight of that dead body reminded him that moby dick was yet to be slain and though a thousand other whales were brought to his ship all that would not one jot advance his grand monomaniac object very soon you would have thought from the sound on the pequods decks that all hands were preparing to cast anchor in the deep for heavy chains are being dragged along the deck and thrust rattling out of the portholes but by those clanking links the vast corpse itself not the ship is to be moored tied by the head to the stern and by the tail to the bows the whale now lies with its black hull close to the vessels and seen through the darkness of the night which obscured the spars and rigging aloft the twoship and whale seemed yoked together like colossal bullocks whereof one reclines while the other remains standing ,MobyDick or The Whale
a little item may as well be related here the strongest and most reliable hold which the ship has upon the whale when moored alongside is by the flukes or tail and as from its greater density that part is relatively heavier than any other excepting the sidefins its flexibility even in death causes it to sink low beneath the surface so that with the hand you cannot get at it from the boat in order to put the chain round it but this difficulty is ingeniously overcome a small strong line is prepared with a wooden float at its outer end and a weight in its middle while the other end is secured to the ship by adroit management the wooden float is made to rise on the other side of the mass so that now having girdled the whale the chain is readily made to follow suit and being slipped along the body is at last locked fast round the smallest part of the tail at the point of junction with its broad flukes or lobes ,MobyDick or The Whale
if moody ahab was now all quiescence at least so far as could be known on deck stubb his second mate flushed with conquest betrayed an unusual but still goodnatured excitement such an unwonted bustle was he in that the staid starbuck his official superior quietly resigned to him for the time the sole management of affairs one small helping cause of all this liveliness in stubb was soon made strangely manifest stubb was a high liver he was somewhat intemperately fond of the whale as a flavorish thing to his palate ,MobyDick or The Whale
here be it known that though these wild fishermen do not as a general thing and according to the great military maxim make the enemy defray the current expenses of the war at least before realizing the proceeds of the voyage yet now and then you find some of these nantucketers who have a genuine relish for that particular part of the sperm whale designated by stubb comprising the tapering extremity of the body ,MobyDick or The Whale
about midnight that steak was cut and cooked and lighted by two lanterns of sperm oil stubb stoutly stood up to his spermaceti supper at the capstanhead as if that capstan were a sideboard nor was stubb the only banqueter on whales flesh that night mingling their mumblings with his own mastications thousands on thousands of sharks swarming round the dead leviathan smackingly feasted on its fatness the few sleepers below in their bunks were often startled by the sharp slapping of their tails against the hull within a few inches of the sleepers hearts peering over the side you could just see them as before you heard them wallowing in the sullen black waters and turning over on their backs as they scooped out huge globular pieces of the whale of the bigness of a human head this particular feat of the shark seems all but miraculous how at such an apparently unassailable surface they contrive to gouge out such symmetrical mouthfuls remains a part of the universal problem of all things the mark they thus leave on the whale may best be likened to the hollow made by a carpenter in countersinking for a screw ,MobyDick or The Whale
though amid all the smoking horror and diabolism of a seafight sharks will be seen longingly gazing up to the ships decks like hungry dogs round a table where red meat is being carved ready to bolt down every killed man that is tossed to them and though while the valiant butchers over the decktable are thus cannibally carving each others live meat with carvingknives all gilded and tasselled the sharks also with their jewelhilted mouths are quarrelsomely carving away under the table at the dead meat and though were you to turn the whole affair upside down it would still be pretty much the same thing that is to say a shocking sharkish business enough for all parties and though sharks also are the invariable outriders of all slave ships crossing the atlantic systematically trotting alongside to be handy in case a parcel is to be carried anywhere or a dead slave to be decently buried and though one or two other like instances might be set down touching the set terms places and occasions when sharks do most socially congregate and most hilariously feast yet is there no conceivable time or occasion when you will find them in such countless numbers and in gayer or more jovial spirits than around a dead sperm whale moored by night to a whaleship at sea if you have never seen that sight then suspend your decision about the propriety of devilworship and the expediency of conciliating the devil ,MobyDick or The Whale
cook cookwheres that old fleece he cried at length widening his legs still further as if to form a more secure base for his supper and at the same time darting his fork into the dish as if stabbing with his lance cook you cooksail this way cook ,MobyDick or The Whale
the old black not in any very high glee at having been previously roused from his warm hammock at a most unseasonable hour came shambling along from his galley for like many old blacks there was something the matter with his kneepans which he did not keep well scoured like his other pans this old fleece as they called him came shuffling and limping along assisting his step with his tongs which after a clumsy fashion were made of straightened iron hoops this old ebony floundered along and in obedience to the word of command came to a dead stop on the opposite side of stubbs sideboard when with both hands folded before him and resting on his twolegged cane he bowed his arched back still further over at the same time sideways inclining his head so as to bring his best ear into play ,MobyDick or The Whale
cook said stubb rapidly lifting a rather reddish morsel to his mouth dont you think this steak is rather overdone youve been beating this steak too much cook its too tender dont i always say that to be good a whalesteak must be tough there are those sharks now over the side dont you see they prefer it tough and rare what a shindy they are kicking up cook go and talk to em tell em they are welcome to help themselves civilly and in moderation but they must keep quiet blast me if i can hear my own voice away cook and deliver my message here take this lantern snatching one from his sideboard now then go and preach to em ,MobyDick or The Whale
sullenly taking the offered lantern old fleece limped across the deck to the bulwarks and then with one hand dropping his light low over the sea so as to get a good view of his congregation with the other hand he solemnly flourished his tongs and leaning far over the side in a mumbling voice began addressing the sharks while stubb softly crawling behind overheard all that was said ,MobyDick or The Whale
fellowcritters ise ordered here to say dat you must stop dat dam noise dare you hear stop dat dam smackin ob de lip massa stubb say dat you can fill your dam bellies up to de hatchings but by gor you must stop dat dam racket ,MobyDick or The Whale

and you have lived in this world hard upon one hundred years cook and dont know yet how to cook a whalesteak rapidly bolting another mouthful at the last word so that morsel seemed a continuation of the question where were you born cook ,MobyDick or The Whale
and you have once in your life passed a holy church in capetown where you doubtless overheard a holy parson addressing his hearers as his beloved fellowcreatures have you cook and yet you come here and tell me such a dreadful lie as you did just now eh said stubb where do you expect to go to cook ,MobyDick or The Whale
you said up there didnt you and now look yourself and see where your tongs are pointing but perhaps you expect to get into heaven by crawling through the lubbers hole cook but no no cook you dont get there except you go the regular way round by the rigging its a ticklish business but must be done or else its no go but none of us are in heaven yet drop your tongs cook and hear my orders do ye hear hold your hat in one hand and clap tother atop of your heart when im giving my orders cook what that your heart therethats your gizzard aloft aloftthats itnow you have it hold it there now and pay attention ,MobyDick or The Whale
well then cook you see this whalesteak of yours was so very bad that i have put it out of sight as soon as possible you see that dont you well for the future when you cook another whalesteak for my private table here the capstan ill tell you what to do so as not to spoil it by overdoing hold the steak in one hand and show a live coal to it with the other that done dish it dye hear and now tomorrow cook when we are cutting in the fish be sure you stand by to get the tips of his fins have them put in pickle as for the ends of the flukes have them soused cook there now ye may go ,MobyDick or The Whale
that mortal man should feed upon the creature that feeds his lamp and like stubb eat him by his own light as you may say this seems so outlandish a thing that one must needs go a little into the history and philosophy of it ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is upon record that three centuries ago the tongue of the right whale was esteemed a great delicacy in france and commanded large prices there also that in henry viiiths time a certain cook of the court obtained a handsome reward for inventing an admirable sauce to be eaten with barbacued porpoises which you remember are a species of whale porpoises indeed are to this day considered fine eating the meat is made into balls about the size of billiard balls and being well seasoned and spiced might be taken for turtleballs or veal balls the old monks of dunfermline were very fond of them they had a great porpoise grant from the crown ,MobyDick or The Whale
the fact is that among his hunters at least the whale would by all hands be considered a noble dish were there not so much of him but when you come to sit down before a meatpie nearly one hundred feet long it takes away your appetite only the most unprejudiced of men like stubb nowadays partake of cooked whales but the esquimaux are not so fastidious we all know how they live upon whales and have rare old vintages of prime old train oil zogranda one of their most famous doctors recommends strips of blubber for infants as being exceedingly juicy and nourishing and this reminds me that certain englishmen who long ago were accidentally left in greenland by a whaling vesselthat these men actually lived for several months on the mouldy scraps of whales which had been left ashore after trying out the blubber among the dutch whalemen these scraps are called fritters which indeed they greatly resemble being brown and crisp and smelling something like old amsterdam housewives doughnuts or olycooks when fresh they have such an eatable look that the most selfdenying stranger can hardly keep his hands off ,MobyDick or The Whale
but what further depreciates the whale as a civilized dish is his exceeding richness he is the great prize ox of the sea too fat to be delicately good look at his hump which would be as fine eating as the buffalos which is esteemed a rare dish were it not such a solid pyramid of fat but the spermaceti itself how bland and creamy that is like the transparent halfjellied white meat of a cocoanut in the third month of its growth yet far too rich to supply a substitute for butter nevertheless many whalemen have a method of absorbing it into some other substance and then partaking of it in the long try watches of the night it is a common thing for the seamen to dip their shipbiscuit into the huge oilpots and let them fry there awhile many a good supper have i thus made ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the case of a small sperm whale the brains are accounted a fine dish the casket of the skull is broken into with an axe and the two plump whitish lobes being withdrawn precisely resembling two large puddings they are then mixed with flour and cooked into a most delectable mess in flavor somewhat resembling calves head which is quite a dish among some epicures and every one knows that some young bucks among the epicures by continually dining upon calves brains by and by get to have a little brains of their own so as to be able to tell a calfs head from their own heads which indeed requires uncommon discrimination and that is the reason why a young buck with an intelligent looking calfs head before him is somehow one of the saddest sights you can see the head looks a sort of reproachfully at him with an et tu brute expression ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is not perhaps entirely because the whale is so excessively unctuous that landsmen seem to regard the eating of him with abhorrence that appears to result in some way from the consideration before mentioned ie that a man should eat a newly murdered thing of the sea and eat it too by its own light but no doubt the first man that ever murdered an ox was regarded as a murderer perhaps he was hung and if he had been put on his trial by oxen he certainly would have been and he certainly deserved it if any murderer does go to the meatmarket of a saturday night and see the crowds of live bipeds staring up at the long rows of dead quadrupeds does not that sight take a tooth out of the cannibals jaw cannibals who is not a cannibal i tell you it will be more tolerable for the fejee that salted down a lean missionary in his cellar against a coming famine it will be more tolerable for that provident fejee i say in the day of judgment than for thee civilized and enlightened gourmand who nailest geese to the ground and feastest on their bloated livers in thy patdefoiegras ,MobyDick or The Whale
but stubb he eats the whale by its own light does he and that is adding insult to injury is it look at your knifehandle there my civilized and enlightened gourmand dining off that roast beef what is that handle made ofwhat but the bones of the brother of the very ox you are eating and what do you pick your teeth with after devouring that fat goose with a feather of the same fowl and with what quill did the secretary of the society for the suppression of cruelty to ganders formally indite his circulars it is only within the last month or two that that society passed a resolution to patronize nothing but steel pens ,MobyDick or The Whale
when in the southern fishery a captured sperm whale after long and weary toil is brought alongside late at night it is not as a general thing at least customary to proceed at once to the business of cutting him in for that business is an exceedingly laborious one is not very soon completed and requires all hands to set about it therefore the common usage is to take in all sail lash the helm alee and then send every one below to his hammock till daylight with the reservation that until that time anchorwatches shall be kept that is two and two for an hour each couple the crew in rotation shall mount the deck to see that all goes well ,MobyDick or The Whale
but sometimes especially upon the line in the pacific this plan will not answer at all because such incalculable hosts of sharks gather round the moored carcase that were he left so for six hours say on a stretch little more than the skeleton would be visible by morning in most other parts of the ocean however where these fish do not so largely abound their wondrous voracity can be at times considerably diminished by vigorously stirring them up with sharp whalingspades a procedure notwithstanding which in some instances only seems to tickle them into still greater activity but it was not thus in the present case with the pequods sharks though to be sure any man unaccustomed to such sights to have looked over her side that night would have almost thought the whole round sea was one huge cheese and those sharks the maggots in it ,MobyDick or The Whale
nevertheless upon stubb setting the anchorwatch after his supper was concluded and when accordingly queequeg and a forecastle seaman came on deck no small excitement was created among the sharks for immediately suspending the cutting stages over the side and lowering three lanterns so that they cast long gleams of light over the turbid sea these two mariners darting their long whalingspades kept up an incessant murdering of the sharks by striking the keen steel deep into their skulls seemingly their only vital part but in the foamy confusion of their mixed and struggling hosts the marksmen could not always hit their mark and this brought about new revelations of the incredible ferocity of the foe they viciously snapped not only at each others disembowelments but like flexible bows bent round and bit their own till those entrails seemed swallowed over and over again by the same mouth to be oppositely voided by the gaping wound nor was this all it was unsafe to meddle with the corpses and ghosts of these creatures a sort of generic or pantheistic vitality seemed to lurk in their very joints and bones after what might be called the individual life had departed killed and hoisted on deck for the sake of his skin one of these sharks almost took poor queequegs hand off when he tried to shut down the dead lid of his murderous jaw ,MobyDick or The Whale
the whalingspade used for cuttingin is made of the very best steel is about the bigness of a mans spread hand and in general shape corresponds to the garden implement after which it is named only its sides are perfectly flat and its upper end considerably narrower than the lower this weapon is always kept as sharp as possible and when being used is occasionally honed just like a razor in its socket a stiff pole from twenty to thirty feet long is inserted for a handle ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a saturday night and such a sabbath as followed ex officio professors of sabbath breaking are all whalemen the ivory pequod was turned into what seemed a shamble every sailor a butcher you would have thought we were offering up ten thousand red oxen to the sea gods ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the first place the enormous cutting tackles among other ponderous things comprising a cluster of blocks generally painted green and which no single man can possibly liftthis vast bunch of grapes was swayed up to the maintop and firmly lashed to the lower masthead the strongest point anywhere above a ships deck the end of the hawserlike rope winding through these intricacies was then conducted to the windlass and the huge lower block of the tackles was swung over the whale to this block the great blubber hook weighing some one hundred pounds was attached and now suspended in stages over the side starbuck and stubb the mates armed with their long spades began cutting a hole in the body for the insertion of the hook just above the nearest of the two sidefins this done a broad semicircular line is cut round the hole the hook is inserted and the main body of the crew striking up a wild chorus now commence heaving in one dense crowd at the windlass when instantly the entire ship careens over on her side every bolt in her starts like the nailheads of an old house in frosty weather she trembles quivers and nods her frighted mastheads to the sky more and more she leans over to the whale while every gasping heave of the windlass is answered by a helping heave from the billows till at last a swift startling snap is heard with a great swash the ship rolls upwards and backwards from the whale and the triumphant tackle rises into sight dragging after it the disengaged semicircular end of the first strip of blubber now as the blubber envelopes the whale precisely as the rind does an orange so is it stripped off from the body precisely as an orange is sometimes stripped by spiralizing it for the strain constantly kept up by the windlass continually keeps the whale rolling over and over in the water and as the blubber in one strip uniformly peels off along the line called the scarf simultaneously cut by the spades of starbuck and stubb the mates and just as fast as it is thus peeled off and indeed by that very act itself it is all the time being hoisted higher and higher aloft till its upper end grazes the maintop the men at the windlass then cease heaving and for a moment or two the prodigious blooddripping mass sways to and fro as if let down from the sky and every one present must take good heed to dodge it when it swings else it may box his ears and pitch him headlong overboard ,MobyDick or The Whale
one of the attending harpooneers now advances with a long keen weapon called a boardingsword and watching his chance he dexterously slices out a considerable hole in the lower part of the swaying mass into this hole the end of the second alternating great tackle is then hooked so as to retain a hold upon the blubber in order to prepare for what follows whereupon this accomplished swordsman warning all hands to stand off once more makes a scientific dash at the mass and with a few sidelong desperate lunging slicings severs it completely in twain so that while the short lower part is still fast the long upper strip called a blanketpiece swings clear and is all ready for lowering the heavers forward now resume their song and while the one tackle is peeling and hoisting a second strip from the whale the other is slowly slackened away and down goes the first strip through the main hatchway right beneath into an unfurnished parlor called the blubberroom into this twilight apartment sundry nimble hands keep coiling away the long blanketpiece as if it were a great live mass of plaited serpents and thus the work proceeds the two tackles hoisting and lowering simultaneously both whale and windlass heaving the heavers singing the blubberroom gentlemen coiling the mates scarfing the ship straining and all hands swearing occasionally by way of assuaging the general friction ,MobyDick or The Whale
i have given no small attention to that not unvexed subject the skin of the whale i have had controversies about it with experienced whalemen afloat and learned naturalists ashore my original opinion remains unchanged but it is only an opinion ,MobyDick or The Whale
the question is what and where is the skin of the whale already you know what his blubber is that blubber is something of the consistence of firm closegrained beef but tougher more elastic and compact and ranges from eight or ten to twelve and fifteen inches in thickness ,MobyDick or The Whale
now however preposterous it may at first seem to talk of any creatures skin as being of that sort of consistence and thickness yet in point of fact these are no arguments against such a presumption because you cannot raise any other dense enveloping layer from the whales body but that same blubber and the outermost enveloping layer of any animal if reasonably dense what can that be but the skin true from the unmarred dead body of the whale you may scrape off with your hand an infinitely thin transparent substance somewhat resembling the thinnest shreds of isinglass only it is almost as flexible and soft as satin that is previous to being dried when it not only contracts and thickens but becomes rather hard and brittle i have several such dried bits which i use for marks in my whalebooks it is transparent as i said before and being laid upon the printed page i have sometimes pleased myself with fancying it exerted a magnifying influence at any rate it is pleasant to read about whales through their own spectacles as you may say but what i am driving at here is this that same infinitely thin isinglass substance which i admit invests the entire body of the whale is not so much to be regarded as the skin of the creature as the skin of the skin so to speak for it were simply ridiculous to say that the proper skin of the tremendous whale is thinner and more tender than the skin of a newborn child but no more of this ,MobyDick or The Whale
assuming the blubber to be the skin of the whale then when this skin as in the case of a very large sperm whale will yield the bulk of one hundred barrels of oil and when it is considered that in quantity or rather weight that oil in its expressed state is only three fourths and not the entire substance of the coat some idea may hence be had of the enormousness of that animated mass a mere part of whose mere integument yields such a lake of liquid as that reckoning ten barrels to the ton you have ten tons for the net weight of only three quarters of the stuff of the whales skin ,MobyDick or The Whale
in life the visible surface of the sperm whale is not the least among the many marvels he presents almost invariably it is all over obliquely crossed and recrossed with numberless straight marks in thick array something like those in the finest italian line engravings but these marks do not seem to be impressed upon the isinglass substance above mentioned but seem to be seen through it as if they were engraved upon the body itself nor is this all in some instances to the quick observant eye those linear marks as in a veritable engraving but afford the ground for far other delineations these are hieroglyphical that is if you call those mysterious cyphers on the walls of pyramids hieroglyphics then that is the proper word to use in the present connexion by my retentive memory of the hieroglyphics upon one sperm whale in particular i was much struck with a plate representing the old indian characters chiselled on the famous hieroglyphic palisades on the banks of the upper mississippi like those mystic rocks too the mysticmarked whale remains undecipherable this allusion to the indian rocks reminds me of another thing besides all the other phenomena which the exterior of the sperm whale presents he not seldom displays the back and more especially his flanks effaced in great part of the regular linear appearance by reason of numerous rude scratches altogether of an irregular random aspect i should say that those new england rocks on the seacoast which agassiz imagines to bear the marks of violent scraping contact with vast floating icebergsi should say that those rocks must not a little resemble the sperm whale in this particular it also seems to me that such scratches in the whale are probably made by hostile contact with other whales for i have most remarked them in the large fullgrown bulls of the species ,MobyDick or The Whale
a word or two more concerning this matter of the skin or blubber of the whale it has already been said that it is stript from him in long pieces called blanketpieces like most seaterms this one is very happy and significant for the whale is indeed wrapt up in his blubber as in a real blanket or counterpane or still better an indian poncho slipt over his head and skirting his extremity it is by reason of this cosy blanketing of his body that the whale is enabled to keep himself comfortable in all weathers in all seas times and tides what would become of a greenland whale say in those shuddering icy seas of the north if unsupplied with his cosy surtout true other fish are found exceedingly brisk in those hyperborean waters but these be it observed are your coldblooded lungless fish whose very bellies are refrigerators creatures that warm themselves under the lee of an iceberg as a traveller in winter would bask before an inn fire whereas like man the whale has lungs and warm blood freeze his blood and he dies how wonderful is it thenexcept after explanationthat this great monster to whom corporeal warmth is as indispensable as it is to man how wonderful that he should be found at home immersed to his lips for life in those arctic waters where when seamen fall overboard they are sometimes found months afterwards perpendicularly frozen into the hearts of fields of ice as a fly is found glued in amber but more surprising is it to know as has been proved by experiment that the blood of a polar whale is warmer than that of a borneo negro in summer ,MobyDick or The Whale
it does seem to me that herein we see the rare virtue of a strong individual vitality and the rare virtue of thick walls and the rare virtue of interior spaciousness oh man admire and model thyself after the whale do thou too remain warm among ice do thou too live in this world without being of it be cool at the equator keep thy blood fluid at the pole like the great dome of st peters and like the great whale retain o man in all seasons a temperature of thine own ,MobyDick or The Whale
the vast tackles have now done their duty the peeled white body of the beheaded whale flashes like a marble sepulchre though changed in hue it has not perceptibly lost anything in bulk it is still colossal slowly it floats more and more away the water round it torn and splashed by the insatiate sharks and the air above vexed with rapacious flights of screaming fowls whose beaks are like so many insulting poniards in the whale the vast white headless phantom floats further and further from the ship and every rod that it so floats what seem square roods of sharks and cubic roods of fowls augment the murderous din for hours and hours from the almost stationary ship that hideous sight is seen beneath the unclouded and mild azure sky upon the fair face of the pleasant sea wafted by the joyous breezes that great mass of death floats on and on till lost in infinite perspectives ,MobyDick or The Whale
theres a most doleful and most mocking funeral the seavultures all in pious mourning the airsharks all punctiliously in black or speckled in life but few of them would have helped the whale i ween if peradventure he had needed it but upon the banquet of his funeral they most piously do pounce oh horrible vultureism of earth from which not the mightiest whale is free ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor is this the end desecrated as the body is a vengeful ghost survives and hovers over it to scare espied by some timid manofwar or blundering discoveryvessel from afar when the distance obscuring the swarming fowls nevertheless still shows the white mass floating in the sun and the white spray heaving high against it straightway the whales unharming corpse with trembling fingers is set down in the logshoals rocks and breakers hereabouts beware and for years afterwards perhaps ships shun the place leaping over it as silly sheep leap over a vacuum because their leader originally leaped there when a stick was held theres your law of precedents theres your utility of traditions theres the story of your obstinate survival of old beliefs never bottomed on the earth and now not even hovering in the air theres orthodoxy ,MobyDick or The Whale
it should not have been omitted that previous to completely stripping the body of the leviathan he was beheaded now the beheading of the sperm whale is a scientific anatomical feat upon which experienced whale surgeons very much pride themselves and not without reason ,MobyDick or The Whale
consider that the whale has nothing that can properly be called a neck on the contrary where his head and body seem to join there in that very place is the thickest part of him remember also that the surgeon must operate from above some eight or ten feet intervening between him and his subject and that subject almost hidden in a discoloured rolling and oftentimes tumultuous and bursting sea bear in mind too that under these untoward circumstances he has to cut many feet deep in the flesh and in that subterraneous manner without so much as getting one single peep into the evercontracting gash thus made he must skilfully steer clear of all adjacent interdicted parts and exactly divide the spine at a critical point hard by its insertion into the skull do you not marvel then at stubbs boast that he demanded but ten minutes to behead a sperm whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
when first severed the head is dropped astern and held there by a cable till the body is stripped that done if it belong to a small whale it is hoisted on deck to be deliberately disposed of but with a full grown leviathan this is impossible for the sperm whales head embraces nearly one third of his entire bulk and completely to suspend such a burden as that even by the immense tackles of a whaler this were as vain a thing as to attempt weighing a dutch barn in jewellers scales ,MobyDick or The Whale
the pequods whale being decapitated and the body stripped the head was hoisted against the ships sideabout half way out of the sea so that it might yet in great part be buoyed up by its native element and there with the strained craft steeply leaning over to it by reason of the enormous downward drag from the lower masthead and every yardarm on that side projecting like a crane over the waves there that blooddripping head hung to the pequods waist like the giant holoferness from the girdle of judith ,MobyDick or The Whale
when this last task was accomplished it was noon and the seamen went below to their dinner silence reigned over the before tumultuous but now deserted deck an intense copper calm like a universal yellow lotus was more and more unfolding its noiseless measureless leaves upon the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
a short space elapsed and up into this noiselessness came ahab alone from his cabin taking a few turns on the quarterdeck he paused to gaze over the side then slowly getting into the mainchains he took stubbs long spadestill remaining there after the whales decapitationand striking it into the lower part of the halfsuspended mass placed its other end crutchwise under one arm and so stood leaning over with eyes attentively fixed on this head ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a black and hooded head and hanging there in the midst of so intense a calm it seemed the sphynxs in the desert speak thou vast and venerable head muttered ahab which though ungarnished with a beard yet here and there lookest hoary with mosses speak mighty head and tell us the secret thing that is in thee of all divers thou hast dived the deepest that head upon which the upper sun now gleams has moved amid this worlds foundations where unrecorded names and navies rust and untold hopes and anchors rot where in her murderous hold this frigate earth is ballasted with bones of millions of the drowned there in that awful waterland there was thy most familiar home thou hast been where bell or diver never went hast slept by many a sailors side where sleepless mothers would give their lives to lay them down thou sawst the locked lovers when leaping from their flaming ship heart to heart they sank beneath the exulting wave true to each other when heaven seemed false to them thou sawst the murdered mate when tossed by pirates from the midnight deck for hours he fell into the deeper midnight of the insatiate maw and his murderers still sailed on unharmedwhile swift lightnings shivered the neighboring ship that would have borne a righteous husband to outstretched longing arms o head thou hast seen enough to split the planets and make an infidel of abraham and not one syllable is thine ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye well now thats cheering cried ahab suddenly erecting himself while whole thunderclouds swept aside from his brow that lively cry upon this deadly calm might almost convert a better manwhere away ,MobyDick or The Whale
better and better man would now st paul would come along that way and to my breezelessness bring his breeze o nature and o soul of man how far beyond all utterance are your linked analogies not the smallest atom stirs or lives on matter but has its cunning duplicate in mind ,MobyDick or The Whale
by and by through the glass the strangers boats and manned mastheads proved her a whaleship but as she was so far to windward and shooting by apparently making a passage to some other ground the pequod could not hope to reach her so the signal was set to see what response would be made ,MobyDick or The Whale
here be it said that like the vessels of military marines the ships of the american whale fleet have each a private signal all which signals being collected in a book with the names of the respective vessels attached every captain is provided with it thereby the whale commanders are enabled to recognise each other upon the ocean even at considerable distances and with no small facility ,MobyDick or The Whale
the pequods signal was at last responded to by the strangers setting her own which proved the ship to be the jeroboam of nantucket squaring her yards she bore down ranged abeam under the pequods lee and lowered a boat it soon drew nigh but as the sideladder was being rigged by starbucks order to accommodate the visiting captain the stranger in question waved his hand from his boats stern in token of that proceeding being entirely unnecessary it turned out that the jeroboam had a malignant epidemic on board and that mayhew her captain was fearful of infecting the pequods company for though himself and boats crew remained untainted and though his ship was half a rifleshot off and an incorruptible sea and air rolling and flowing between yet conscientiously adhering to the timid quarantine of the land he peremptorily refused to come into direct contact with the pequod ,MobyDick or The Whale
but this did by no means prevent all communications preserving an interval of some few yards between itself and the ship the jeroboams boat by the occasional use of its oars contrived to keep parallel to the pequod as she heavily forged through the sea for by this time it blew very fresh with her maintopsail aback though indeed at times by the sudden onset of a large rolling wave the boat would be pushed some way ahead but would be soon skilfully brought to her proper bearings again subject to this and other the like interruptions now and then a conversation was sustained between the two parties but at intervals not without still another interruption of a very different sort ,MobyDick or The Whale
pulling an oar in the jeroboams boat was a man of a singular appearance even in that wild whaling life where individual notabilities make up all totalities he was a small short youngish man sprinkled all over his face with freckles and wearing redundant yellow hair a longskirted cabalisticallycut coat of a faded walnut tinge enveloped him the overlapping sleeves of which were rolled up on his wrists a deep settled fanatic delirium was in his eyes ,MobyDick or The Whale
so soon as this figure had been first descried stubb had exclaimedthats he thats hethe longtogged scaramouch the townhos company told us of stubb here alluded to a strange story told of the jeroboam and a certain man among her crew some time previous when the pequod spoke the townho according to this account and what was subsequently learned it seemed that the scaramouch in question had gained a wonderful ascendency over almost everybody in the jeroboam his story was this ,MobyDick or The Whale
he had been originally nurtured among the crazy society of neskyeuna shakers where he had been a great prophet in their cracked secret meetings having several times descended from heaven by the way of a trapdoor announcing the speedy opening of the seventh vial which he carried in his vestpocket but which instead of containing gunpowder was supposed to be charged with laudanum a strange apostolic whim having seized him he had left neskyeuna for nantucket where with that cunning peculiar to craziness he assumed a steady commonsense exterior and offered himself as a greenhand candidate for the jeroboams whaling voyage they engaged him but straightway upon the ships getting out of sight of land his insanity broke out in a freshet he announced himself as the archangel gabriel and commanded the captain to jump overboard he published his manifesto whereby he set himself forth as the deliverer of the isles of the sea and vicargeneral of all oceanica the unflinching earnestness with which he declared these thingsthe dark daring play of his sleepless excited imagination and all the preternatural terrors of real delirium united to invest this gabriel in the minds of the majority of the ignorant crew with an atmosphere of sacredness moreover they were afraid of him as such a man however was not of much practical use in the ship especially as he refused to work except when he pleased the incredulous captain would fain have been rid of him but apprised that that individuals intention was to land him in the first convenient port the archangel forthwith opened all his seals and vialsdevoting the ship and all hands to unconditional perdition in case this intention was carried out so strongly did he work upon his disciples among the crew that at last in a body they went to the captain and told him if gabriel was sent from the ship not a man of them would remain he was therefore forced to relinquish his plan nor would they permit gabriel to be any way maltreated say or do what he would so that it came to pass that gabriel had the complete freedom of the ship the consequence of all this was that the archangel cared little or nothing for the captain and mates and since the epidemic had broken out he carried a higher hand than ever declaring that the plague as he called it was at his sole command nor should it be stayed but according to his good pleasure the sailors mostly poor devils cringed and some of them fawned before him in obedience to his instructions sometimes rendering him personal homage as to a god such things may seem incredible but however wondrous they are true nor is the history of fanatics half so striking in respect to the measureless selfdeception of the fanatic himself as his measureless power of deceiving and bedevilling so many others but it is time to return to the pequod ,MobyDick or The Whale
i tell thee again gabriel that but again the boat tore ahead as if dragged by fiends nothing was said for some moments while a succession of riotous waves rolled by which by one of those occasional caprices of the seas were tumbling not heaving it meantime the hoisted sperm whales head jogged about very violently and gabriel was seen eyeing it with rather more apprehensiveness than his archangel nature seemed to warrant ,MobyDick or The Whale
when this interlude was over captain mayhew began a dark story concerning moby dick not however without frequent interruptions from gabriel whenever his name was mentioned and the crazy sea that seemed leagued with him ,MobyDick or The Whale
it seemed that the jeroboam had not long left home when upon speaking a whaleship her people were reliably apprised of the existence of moby dick and the havoc he had made greedily sucking in this intelligence gabriel solemnly warned the captain against attacking the white whale in case the monster should be seen in his gibbering insanity pronouncing the white whale to be no less a being than the shaker god incarnated the shakers receiving the bible but when some year or two afterwards moby dick was fairly sighted from the mastheads macey the chief mate burned with ardour to encounter him and the captain himself being not unwilling to let him have the opportunity despite all the archangels denunciations and forewarnings macey succeeded in persuading five men to man his boat with them he pushed off and after much weary pulling and many perilous unsuccessful onsets he at last succeeded in getting one iron fast meantime gabriel ascending to the mainroyal masthead was tossing one arm in frantic gestures and hurling forth prophecies of speedy doom to the sacrilegious assailants of his divinity now while macey the mate was standing up in his boats bow and with all the reckless energy of his tribe was venting his wild exclamations upon the whale and essaying to get a fair chance for his poised lance lo a broad white shadow rose from the sea by its quick fanning motion temporarily taking the breath out of the bodies of the oarsmen next instant the luckless mate so full of furious life was smitten bodily into the air and making a long arc in his descent fell into the sea at the distance of about fifty yards not a chip of the boat was harmed nor a hair of any oarsmans head but the mate for ever sank ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is well to parenthesize here that of the fatal accidents in the spermwhale fishery this kind is perhaps almost as frequent as any sometimes nothing is injured but the man who is thus annihilated oftener the boats bow is knocked off or the thighboard in which the headsman stands is torn from its place and accompanies the body but strangest of all is the circumstance that in more instances than one when the body has been recovered not a single mark of violence is discernible the man being stark dead ,MobyDick or The Whale
the whole calamity with the falling form of macey was plainly descried from the ship raising a piercing shriekthe vial the vial gabriel called off the terrorstricken crew from the further hunting of the whale this terrible event clothed the archangel with added influence because his credulous disciples believed that he had specifically foreannounced it instead of only making a general prophecy which any one might have done and so have chanced to hit one of many marks in the wide margin allowed he became a nameless terror to the ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
mayhew having concluded his narration ahab put such questions to him that the stranger captain could not forbear inquiring whether he intended to hunt the white whale if opportunity should offer to which ahab answeredaye straightway then gabriel once more started to his feet glaring upon the old man and vehemently exclaimed with downward pointed fingerthink think of the blasphemerdead and down therebeware of the blasphemers end ,MobyDick or The Whale
every whaleship takes out a goodly number of letters for various ships whose delivery to the persons to whom they may be addressed depends upon the mere chance of encountering them in the four oceans thus most letters never reach their mark and many are only received after attaining an age of two or three years or more ,MobyDick or The Whale
soon starbuck returned with a letter in his hand it was sorely tumbled damp and covered with a dull spotted green mould in consequence of being kept in a dark locker of the cabin of such a letter death himself might well have been the postboy ,MobyDick or The Whale
canst not read it cried ahab give it me man aye aye its but a dim scrawlwhats this as he was studying it out starbuck took a long cuttingspade pole and with his knife slightly split the end to insert the letter there and in that way hand it to the boat without its coming any closer to the ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
curses throttle thee yelled ahab captain mayhew stand by now to receive it and taking the fatal missive from starbucks hands he caught it in the slit of the pole and reached it over towards the boat but as he did so the oarsmen expectantly desisted from rowing the boat drifted a little towards the ships stern so that as if by magic the letter suddenly ranged along with gabriels eager hand he clutched it in an instant seized the boatknife and impaling the letter on it sent it thus loaded back into the ship it fell at ahabs feet then gabriel shrieked out to his comrades to give way with their oars and in that manner the mutinous boat rapidly shot away from the pequod ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the tumultuous business of cuttingin and attending to a whale there is much running backwards and forwards among the crew now hands are wanted here and then again hands are wanted there there is no staying in any one place for at one and the same time everything has to be done everywhere it is much the same with him who endeavors the description of the scene we must now retrace our way a little it was mentioned that upon first breaking ground in the whales back the blubberhook was inserted into the original hole there cut by the spades of the mates but how did so clumsy and weighty a mass as that same hook get fixed in that hole it was inserted there by my particular friend queequeg whose duty it was as harpooneer to descend upon the monsters back for the special purpose referred to but in very many cases circumstances require that the harpooneer shall remain on the whale till the whole flensing or stripping operation is concluded the whale be it observed lies almost entirely submerged excepting the immediate parts operated upon so down there some ten feet below the level of the deck the poor harpooneer flounders about half on the whale and half in the water as the vast mass revolves like a treadmill beneath him on the occasion in question queequeg figured in the highland costumea shirt and socksin which to my eyes at least he appeared to uncommon advantage and no one had a better chance to observe him as will presently be seen ,MobyDick or The Whale
being the savages bowsman that is the person who pulled the bowoar in his boat the second one from forward it was my cheerful duty to attend upon him while taking that hardscrabble scramble upon the dead whales back you have seen italian organboys holding a dancingape by a long cord just so from the ships steep side did i hold queequeg down there in the sea by what is technically called in the fishery a monkeyrope attached to a strong strip of canvas belted round his waist ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a humorously perilous business for both of us for before we proceed further it must be said that the monkeyrope was fast at both ends fast to queequegs broad canvas belt and fast to my narrow leather one so that for better or for worse we two for the time were wedded and should poor queequeg sink to rise no more then both usage and honor demanded that instead of cutting the cord it should drag me down in his wake so then an elongated siamese ligature united us queequeg was my own inseparable twin brother nor could i any way get rid of the dangerous liabilities which the hempen bond entailed ,MobyDick or The Whale
so strongly and metaphysically did i conceive of my situation then that while earnestly watching his motions i seemed distinctly to perceive that my own individuality was now merged in a joint stock company of two that my free will had received a mortal wound and that anothers mistake or misfortune might plunge innocent me into unmerited disaster and death therefore i saw that here was a sort of interregnum in providence for its evenhanded equity never could have so gross an injustice and yet still further ponderingwhile i jerked him now and then from between the whale and ship which would threaten to jam himstill further pondering i say i saw that this situation of mine was the precise situation of every mortal that breathes only in most cases he one way or other has this siamese connexion with a plurality of other mortals if your banker breaks you snap if your apothecary by mistake sends you poison in your pills you die true you may say that by exceeding caution you may possibly escape these and the multitudinous other evil chances of life but handle queequegs monkeyrope heedfully as i would sometimes he jerked it so that i came very near sliding overboard nor could i possibly forget that do what i would i only had the management of one end of it ,MobyDick or The Whale
the monkeyrope is found in all whalers but it was only in the pequod that the monkey and his holder were ever tied together this improvement upon the original usage was introduced by no less a man than stubb in order to afford the imperilled harpooneer the strongest possible guarantee for the faithfulness and vigilance of his monkeyrope holder ,MobyDick or The Whale
i have hinted that i would often jerk poor queequeg from between the whale and the shipwhere he would occasionally fall from the incessant rolling and swaying of both but this was not the only jamming jeopardy he was exposed to unappalled by the massacre made upon them during the night the sharks now freshly and more keenly allured by the before pent blood which began to flow from the carcassthe rabid creatures swarmed round it like bees in a beehive ,MobyDick or The Whale
and right in among those sharks was queequeg who often pushed them aside with his floundering feet a thing altogether incredible were it not that attracted by such prey as a dead whale the otherwise miscellaneously carnivorous shark will seldom touch a man ,MobyDick or The Whale
nevertheless it may well be believed that since they have such a ravenous finger in the pie it is deemed but wise to look sharp to them accordingly besides the monkeyrope with which i now and then jerked the poor fellow from too close a vicinity to the maw of what seemed a peculiarly ferocious sharkhe was provided with still another protection suspended over the side in one of the stages tashtego and daggoo continually flourished over his head a couple of keen whalespades wherewith they slaughtered as many sharks as they could reach this procedure of theirs to be sure was very disinterested and benevolent of them they meant queequegs best happiness i admit but in their hasty zeal to befriend him and from the circumstance that both he and the sharks were at times half hidden by the bloodmuddled water those indiscreet spades of theirs would come nearer amputating a leg than a tail but poor queequeg i suppose straining and gasping there with that great iron hookpoor queequeg i suppose only prayed to his yojo and gave up his life into the hands of his gods ,MobyDick or The Whale
well well my dear comrade and twinbrother thought i as i drew in and then slacked off the rope to every swell of the seawhat matters it after all are you not the precious image of each and all of us men in this whaling world that unsounded ocean you gasp in is life those sharks your foes those spades your friends and what between sharks and spades you are in a sad pickle and peril poor lad ,MobyDick or The Whale
but courage there is good cheer in store for you queequeg for now as with blue lips and bloodshot eyes the exhausted savage at last climbs up the chains and stands all dripping and involuntarily trembling over the side the steward advances and with a benevolent consolatory glance hands himwhat some hot cognac no hands him ye gods hands him a cup of tepid ginger and water ,MobyDick or The Whale
ginger do i smell ginger suspiciously asked stubb coming near yes this must be ginger peering into the as yet untasted cup then standing as if incredulous for a while he calmly walked towards the astonished steward slowly saying ginger ginger and will you have the goodness to tell me mr doughboy where lies the virtue of ginger ginger is ginger the sort of fuel you use doughboy to kindle a fire in this shivering cannibal gingerwhat the devil is ginger seacoal firewoodlucifer matchestindergunpowderwhat the devil is ginger i say that you offer this cup to our poor queequeg here ,MobyDick or The Whale
there is some sneaking temperance society movement about this business he suddenly added now approaching starbuck who had just come from forward will you look at that kannakin sir smell of it if you please then watching the mates countenance he added the steward mr starbuck had the face to offer that calomel and jalap to queequeg there this instant off the whale is the steward an apothecary sir and may i ask whether this is the sort of bitters by which he blows back the life into a halfdrowned man ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye aye steward cried stubb well teach you to drug a harpooneer none of your apothecarys medicine here you want to poison us do ye you have got out insurances on our lives and want to murder us all and pocket the proceeds do ye ,MobyDick or The Whale
gingerjub you gingerly rascal take that and run along with ye to the lockers and get something better i hope i do no wrong mr starbuck it is the captains ordersgrog for the harpooneer on a whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
when stubb reappeared he came with a dark flask in one hand and a sort of teacaddy in the other the first contained strong spirits and was handed to queequeg the second was aunt charitys gift and that was freely given to the waves ,MobyDick or The Whale
it must be borne in mind that all this time we have a sperm whales prodigious head hanging to the pequods side but we must let it continue hanging there a while till we can get a chance to attend to it for the present other matters press and the best we can do now for the head is to pray heaven the tackles may hold ,MobyDick or The Whale
now during the past night and forenoon the pequod had gradually drifted into a sea which by its occasional patches of yellow brit gave unusual tokens of the vicinity of right whales a species of the leviathan that but few supposed to be at this particular time lurking anywhere near and though all hands commonly disdained the capture of those inferior creatures and though the pequod was not commissioned to cruise for them at all and though she had passed numbers of them near the crozetts without lowering a boat yet now that a sperm whale had been brought alongside and beheaded to the surprise of all the announcement was made that a right whale should be captured that day if opportunity offered ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor was this long wanting tall spouts were seen to leeward and two boats stubbs and flasks were detached in pursuit pulling further and further away they at last became almost invisible to the men at the masthead but suddenly in the distance they saw a great heap of tumultuous white water and soon after news came from aloft that one or both the boats must be fast an interval passed and the boats were in plain sight in the act of being dragged right towards the ship by the towing whale so close did the monster come to the hull that at first it seemed as if he meant it malice but suddenly going down in a maelstrom within three rods of the planks he wholly disappeared from view as if diving under the keel cut cut was the cry from the ship to the boats which for one instant seemed on the point of being brought with a deadly dash against the vessels side but having plenty of line yet in the tubs and the whale not sounding very rapidly they paid out abundance of rope and at the same time pulled with all their might so as to get ahead of the ship for a few minutes the struggle was intensely critical for while they still slacked out the tightened line in one direction and still plied their oars in another the contending strain threatened to take them under but it was only a few feet advance they sought to gain and they stuck to it till they did gain it when instantly a swift tremor was felt running like lightning along the keel as the strained line scraping beneath the ship suddenly rose to view under her bows snapping and quivering and so flinging off its drippings that the drops fell like bits of broken glass on the water while the whale beyond also rose to sight and once more the boats were free to fly but the fagged whale abated his speed and blindly altering his course went round the stern of the ship towing the two boats after him so that they performed a complete circuit ,MobyDick or The Whale
meantime they hauled more and more upon their lines till close flanking him on both sides stubb answered flask with lance for lance and thus round and round the pequod the battle went while the multitudes of sharks that had before swum round the sperm whales body rushed to the fresh blood that was spilled thirstily drinking at every new gash as the eager israelites did at the new bursting fountains that poured from the smitten rock ,MobyDick or The Whale
wants with it said flask coiling some spare line in the boats bow did you never hear that the ship which but once has a sperm whales head hoisted on her starboard side and at the same time a right whales on the larboard did you never hear stubb that that ship can never afterwards capsize ,MobyDick or The Whale
i dont know but i heard that gamboge ghost of a fedallah saying so and he seems to know all about ships charms but i sometimes think hell charm the ship to no good at last i dont half like that chap stubb did you ever notice how that tusk of his is a sort of carved into a snakes head stubb ,MobyDick or The Whale
sink him i never look at him at all but if ever i get a chance of a dark night and he standing hard by the bulwarks and no one by look down there flaskpointing into the sea with a peculiar motion of both handsaye will i flask i take that fedallah to be the devil in disguise do you believe that cock and bull story about his having been stowed away on board ship hes the devil i say the reason why you dont see his tail is because he tucks it up out of sight he carries it coiled away in his pocket i guess blast him now that i think of it hes always wanting oakum to stuff into the toes of his boots ,MobyDick or The Whale
why do ye see the old man is hard bent after that white whale and the devil there is trying to come round him and get him to swap away his silver watch or his soul or something of that sort and then hell surrender moby dick ,MobyDick or The Whale
i dont know flask but the devil is a curious chap and a wicked one i tell ye why they say as how he went a sauntering into the old flagship once switching his tail about devilish easy and gentlemanlike and inquiring if the old governor was at home well he was at home and asked the devil what he wanted the devil switching his hoofs up and says i want john what for says the old governor what business is that of yours says the devil getting madi want to use him take him says the governorand by the lord flask if the devil didnt give john the asiatic cholera before he got through with him ill eat this whale in one mouthful but look sharpaint you all ready there well then pull ahead and lets get the whale alongside ,MobyDick or The Whale
am i the same man that helped kill this whale doesnt the devil live for ever who ever heard that the devil was dead did you ever see any parson a wearing mourning for the devil and if the devil has a latchkey to get into the admirals cabin dont you suppose he can crawl into a porthole tell me that mr flask ,MobyDick or The Whale
do you see that mainmast there pointing to the ship well thats the figure one now take all the hoops in the pequods hold and string along in a row with that mast for oughts do you see well that wouldnt begin to be fedallahs age nor all the coopers in creation couldnt show hoops enough to make oughts enough ,MobyDick or The Whale
but see here stubb i thought you a little boasted just now that you meant to give fedallah a seatoss if you got a good chance now if hes so old as all those hoops of yours come to and if he is going to live for ever what good will it do to pitch him overboardtell me that ,MobyDick or The Whale
i should like to see him try it id give him such a pair of black eyes that he wouldnt dare to show his face in the admirals cabin again for a long while let alone down in the orlop there where he lives and hereabouts on the upper decks where he sneaks so much damn the devil flask so you suppose im afraid of the devil whos afraid of him except the old governor who daresnt catch him and put him in doubledarbies as he deserves but lets him go about kidnapping people aye and signed a bond with him that all the people the devil kidnapped hed roast for him theres a governor ,MobyDick or The Whale
do i suppose it youll know it before long flask but i am going now to keep a sharp lookout on him and if i see anything very suspicious going on ill just take him by the nape of his neck and saylook here beelzebub you dont do it and if he makes any fuss by the lord ill make a grab into his pocket for his tail take it to the capstan and give him such a wrenching and heaving that his tail will come short off at the stumpdo you see and then i rather guess when he finds himself docked in that queer fashion hell sneak off without the poor satisfaction of feeling his tail between his legs ,MobyDick or The Whale
in good time flasks saying proved true as before the pequod steeply leaned over towards the sperm whales head now by the counterpoise of both heads she regained her even keel though sorely strained you may well believe so when on one side you hoist in lockes head you go over that way but now on the other side hoist in kants and you come back again but in very poor plight thus some minds for ever keep trimming boat oh ye foolish throw all these thunderheads overboard and then you will float light and right ,MobyDick or The Whale
in disposing of the body of a right whale when brought alongside the ship the same preliminary proceedings commonly take place as in the case of a sperm whale only in the latter instance the head is cut off whole but in the former the lips and tongue are separately removed and hoisted on deck with all the well known black bone attached to what is called the crownpiece but nothing like this in the present case had been done the carcases of both whales had dropped astern and the headladen ship not a little resembled a mule carrying a pair of overburdening panniers ,MobyDick or The Whale
meantime fedallah was calmly eyeing the right whales head and ever and anon glancing from the deep wrinkles there to the lines in his own hand and ahab chanced so to stand that the parsee occupied his shadow while if the parsees shadow was there at all it seemed only to blend with and lengthen ahabs as the crew toiled on laplandish speculations were bandied among them concerning all these passing things ,MobyDick or The Whale
of the grand order of folio leviathans the sperm whale and the right whale are by far the most noteworthy they are the only whales regularly hunted by man to the nantucketer they present the two extremes of all the known varieties of the whale as the external difference between them is mainly observable in their heads and as a head of each is this moment hanging from the pequods side and as we may freely go from one to the other by merely stepping across the deckwhere i should like to know will you obtain a better chance to study practical cetology than here ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the first place you are struck by the general contrast between these heads both are massive enough in all conscience but there is a certain mathematical symmetry in the sperm whales which the right whales sadly lacks there is more character in the sperm whales head as you behold it you involuntarily yield the immense superiority to him in point of pervading dignity in the present instance too this dignity is heightened by the pepper and salt colour of his head at the summit giving token of advanced age and large experience in short he is what the fishermen technically call a greyheaded whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
let us now note what is least dissimilar in these headsnamely the two most important organs the eye and the ear far back on the side of the head and low down near the angle of either whales jaw if you narrowly search you will at last see a lashless eye which you would fancy to be a young colts eye so out of all proportion is it to the magnitude of the head ,MobyDick or The Whale
now from this peculiar sideway position of the whales eyes it is plain that he can never see an object which is exactly ahead no more than he can one exactly astern in a word the position of the whales eyes corresponds to that of a mans ears and you may fancy for yourself how it would fare with you did you sideways survey objects through your ears you would find that you could only command some thirty degrees of vision in advance of the straight sideline of sight and about thirty more behind it if your bitterest foe were walking straight towards you with dagger uplifted in broad day you would not be able to see him any more than if he were stealing upon you from behind in a word you would have two backs so to speak but at the same time also two fronts side fronts for what is it that makes the front of a manwhat indeed but his eyes ,MobyDick or The Whale
moreover while in most other animals that i can now think of the eyes are so planted as imperceptibly to blend their visual power so as to produce one picture and not two to the brain the peculiar position of the whales eyes effectually divided as they are by many cubic feet of solid head which towers between them like a great mountain separating two lakes in valleys this of course must wholly separate the impressions which each independent organ imparts the whale therefore must see one distinct picture on this side and another distinct picture on that side while all between must be profound darkness and nothingness to him man may in effect be said to look out on the world from a sentrybox with two joined sashes for his window but with the whale these two sashes are separately inserted making two distinct windows but sadly impairing the view this peculiarity of the whales eyes is a thing always to be borne in mind in the fishery and to be remembered by the reader in some subsequent scenes ,MobyDick or The Whale
a curious and most puzzling question might be started concerning this visual matter as touching the leviathan but i must be content with a hint so long as a mans eyes are open in the light the act of seeing is involuntary that is he cannot then help mechanically seeing whatever objects are before him nevertheless any ones experience will teach him that though he can take in an undiscriminating sweep of things at one glance it is quite impossible for him attentively and completely to examine any two thingshowever large or however smallat one and the same instant of time never mind if they lie side by side and touch each other but if you now come to separate these two objects and surround each by a circle of profound darkness then in order to see one of them in such a manner as to bring your mind to bear on it the other will be utterly excluded from your contemporary consciousness how is it then with the whale true both his eyes in themselves must simultaneously act but is his brain so much more comprehensive combining and subtle than mans that he can at the same moment of time attentively examine two distinct prospects one on one side of him and the other in an exactly opposite direction if he can then is it as marvellous a thing in him as if a man were able simultaneously to go through the demonstrations of two distinct problems in euclid nor strictly investigated is there any incongruity in this comparison ,MobyDick or The Whale
it may be but an idle whim but it has always seemed to me that the extraordinary vacillations of movement displayed by some whales when beset by three or four boats the timidity and liability to queer frights so common to such whales i think that all this indirectly proceeds from the helpless perplexity of volition in which their divided and diametrically opposite powers of vision must involve them ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the ear of the whale is full as curious as the eye if you are an entire stranger to their race you might hunt over these two heads for hours and never discover that organ the ear has no external leaf whatever and into the hole itself you can hardly insert a quill so wondrously minute is it it is lodged a little behind the eye with respect to their ears this important difference is to be observed between the sperm whale and the right while the ear of the former has an external opening that of the latter is entirely and evenly covered over with a membrane so as to be quite imperceptible from without ,MobyDick or The Whale
is it not curious that so vast a being as the whale should see the world through so small an eye and hear the thunder through an ear which is smaller than a hares but if his eyes were broad as the lens of herschels great telescope and his ears capacious as the porches of cathedrals would that make him any longer of sight or sharper of hearing not at allwhy then do you try to enlarge your mind subtilize it ,MobyDick or The Whale
let us now with whatever levers and steamengines we have at hand cant over the sperm whales head that it may lie bottom up then ascending by a ladder to the summit have a peep down the mouth and were it not that the body is now completely separated from it with a lantern we might descend into the great kentucky mammoth cave of his stomach but let us hold on here by this tooth and look about us where we are what a really beautiful and chastelooking mouth from floor to ceiling lined or rather papered with a glistening white membrane glossy as bridal satins ,MobyDick or The Whale
but come out now and look at this portentous lower jaw which seems like the long narrow lid of an immense snuffbox with the hinge at one end instead of one side if you pry it up so as to get it overhead and expose its rows of teeth it seems a terrific portcullis and such alas it proves to many a poor wight in the fishery upon whom these spikes fall with impaling force but far more terrible is it to behold when fathoms down in the sea you see some sulky whale floating there suspended with his prodigious jaw some fifteen feet long hanging straight down at rightangles with his body for all the world like a ships jibboom this whale is not dead he is only dispirited out of sorts perhaps hypochondriac and so supine that the hinges of his jaw have relaxed leaving him there in that ungainly sort of plight a reproach to all his tribe who must no doubt imprecate lockjaws upon him ,MobyDick or The Whale
in most cases this lower jawbeing easily unhinged by a practised artistis disengaged and hoisted on deck for the purpose of extracting the ivory teeth and furnishing a supply of that hard white whalebone with which the fishermen fashion all sorts of curious articles including canes umbrellastocks and handles to ridingwhips ,MobyDick or The Whale
with a long weary hoist the jaw is dragged on board as if it were an anchor and when the proper time comessome few days after the other workqueequeg daggoo and tashtego being all accomplished dentists are set to drawing teeth with a keen cuttingspade queequeg lances the gums then the jaw is lashed down to ringbolts and a tackle being rigged from aloft they drag out these teeth as michigan oxen drag stumps of old oaks out of wild wood lands there are generally fortytwo teeth in all in old whales much worn down but undecayed nor filled after our artificial fashion the jaw is afterwards sawn into slabs and piled away like joists for building houses ,MobyDick or The Whale
as in general shape the noble sperm whales head may be compared to a roman warchariot especially in front where it is so broadly rounded so at a broad view the right whales head bears a rather inelegant resemblance to a gigantic galliottoed shoe two hundred years ago an old dutch voyager likened its shape to that of a shoemakers last and in this same last or shoe that old woman of the nursery tale with the swarming brood might very comfortably be lodged she and all her progeny ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as you come nearer to this great head it begins to assume different aspects according to your point of view if you stand on its summit and look at these two fshaped spoutholes you would take the whole head for an enormous bassviol and these spiracles the apertures in its soundingboard then again if you fix your eye upon this strange crested comblike incrustation on the top of the massthis green barnacled thing which the greenlanders call the crown and the southern fishers the bonnet of the right whale fixing your eyes solely on this you would take the head for the trunk of some huge oak with a birds nest in its crotch at any rate when you watch those live crabs that nestle here on this bonnet such an idea will be almost sure to occur to you unless indeed your fancy has been fixed by the technical term crown also bestowed upon it in which case you will take great interest in thinking how this mighty monster is actually a diademed king of the sea whose green crown has been put together for him in this marvellous manner but if this whale be a king he is a very sulky looking fellow to grace a diadem look at that hanging lower lip what a huge sulk and pout is there a sulk and pout by carpenters measurement about twenty feet long and five feet deep a sulk and pout that will yield you some  gallons of oil and more ,MobyDick or The Whale
a great pity now that this unfortunate whale should be harelipped the fissure is about a foot across probably the mother during an important interval was sailing down the peruvian coast when earthquakes caused the beach to gape over this lip as over a slippery threshold we now slide into the mouth upon my word were i at mackinaw i should take this to be the inside of an indian wigwam good lord is this the road that jonah went the roof is about twelve feet high and runs to a pretty sharp angle as if there were a regular ridgepole there while these ribbed arched hairy sides present us with those wondrous half vertical scimetarshaped slats of whalebone say three hundred on a side which depending from the upper part of the head or crown bone form those venetian blinds which have elsewhere been cursorily mentioned the edges of these bones are fringed with hairy fibres through which the right whale strains the water and in whose intricacies he retains the small fish when openmouthed he goes through the seas of brit in feeding time in the central blinds of bone as they stand in their natural order there are certain curious marks curves hollows and ridges whereby some whalemen calculate the creatures age as the age of an oak by its circular rings though the certainty of this criterion is far from demonstrable yet it has the savor of analogical probability at any rate if we yield to it we must grant a far greater age to the right whale than at first glance will seem reasonable ,MobyDick or The Whale
in old times there seem to have prevailed the most curious fancies concerning these blinds one voyager in purchas calls them the wondrous whiskers inside of the whales mouth another hogs bristles a third old gentleman in hackluyt uses the following elegant language there are about two hundred and fifty fins growing on each side of his upper chop which arch over his tongue on each side of his mouth ,MobyDick or The Whale
this reminds us that the right whale really has a sort of whisker or rather a moustache consisting of a few scattered white hairs on the upper part of the outer end of the lower jaw sometimes these tufts impart a rather brigandish expression to his otherwise solemn countenance ,MobyDick or The Whale
as every one knows these same hogs bristles fins whiskers blinds or whatever you please furnish to the ladies their busks and other stiffening contrivances but in this particular the demand has long been on the decline it was in queen annes time that the bone was in its glory the farthingale being then all the fashion and as those ancient dames moved about gaily though in the jaws of the whale as you may say even so in a shower with the like thoughtlessness do we nowadays fly under the same jaws for protection the umbrella being a tent spread over the same bone ,MobyDick or The Whale
but now forget all about blinds and whiskers for a moment and standing in the right whales mouth look around you afresh seeing all these colonnades of bone so methodically ranged about would you not think you were inside of the great haarlem organ and gazing upon its thousand pipes for a carpet to the organ we have a rug of the softest turkeythe tongue which is glued as it were to the floor of the mouth it is very fat and tender and apt to tear in pieces in hoisting it on deck this particular tongue now before us at a passing glance i should say it was a sixbarreler that is it will yield you about that amount of oil ,MobyDick or The Whale
ere this you must have plainly seen the truth of what i started withthat the sperm whale and the right whale have almost entirely different heads to sum up then in the right whales there is no great well of sperm no ivory teeth at all no long slender mandible of a lower jaw like the sperm whales nor in the sperm whale are there any of those blinds of bone no huge lower lip and scarcely anything of a tongue again the right whale has two external spoutholes the sperm whale only one ,MobyDick or The Whale
can you catch the expression of the sperm whales there it is the same he died with only some of the longer wrinkles in the forehead seem now faded away i think his broad brow to be full of a prairielike placidity born of a speculative indifference as to death but mark the other heads expression see that amazing lower lip pressed by accident against the vessels side so as firmly to embrace the jaw does not this whole head seem to speak of an enormous practical resolution in facing death this right whale i take to have been a stoic the sperm whale a platonian who might have taken up spinoza in his latter years ,MobyDick or The Whale
ere quitting for the nonce the sperm whales head i would have you as a sensible physiologist simplyparticularly remark its front aspect in all its compacted collectedness i would have you investigate it now with the sole view of forming to yourself some unexaggerated intelligent estimate of whatever batteringram power may be lodged there here is a vital point for you must either satisfactorily settle this matter with yourself or for ever remain an infidel as to one of the most appalling but not the less true events perhaps anywhere to be found in all recorded history ,MobyDick or The Whale
you observe that in the ordinary swimming position of the sperm whale the front of his head presents an almost wholly vertical plane to the water you observe that the lower part of that front slopes considerably backwards so as to furnish more of a retreat for the long socket which receives the boomlike lower jaw you observe that the mouth is entirely under the head much in the same way indeed as though your own mouth were entirely under your chin moreover you observe that the whale has no external nose and that what nose he hashis spout holeis on the top of his head you observe that his eyes and ears are at the sides of his head nearly one third of his entire length from the front wherefore you must now have perceived that the front of the sperm whales head is a dead blind wall without a single organ or tender prominence of any sort whatsoever furthermore you are now to consider that only in the extreme lower backward sloping part of the front of the head is there the slightest vestige of bone and not till you get near twenty feet from the forehead do you come to the full cranial development so that this whole enormous boneless mass is as one wad finally though as will soon be revealed its contents partly comprise the most delicate oil yet you are now to be apprised of the nature of the substance which so impregnably invests all that apparent effeminacy in some previous place i have described to you how the blubber wraps the body of the whale as the rind wraps an orange just so with the head but with this difference about the head this envelope though not so thick is of a boneless toughness inestimable by any man who has not handled it the severest pointed harpoon the sharpest lance darted by the strongest human arm impotently rebounds from it it is as though the forehead of the sperm whale were paved with horses hoofs i do not think that any sensation lurks in it ,MobyDick or The Whale
bethink yourself also of another thing when two large loaded indiamen chance to crowd and crush towards each other in the docks what do the sailors do they do not suspend between them at the point of coming contact any merely hard substance like iron or wood no they hold there a large round wad of tow and cork enveloped in the thickest and toughest of oxhide that bravely and uninjured takes the jam which would have snapped all their oaken handspikes and iron crowbars by itself this sufficiently illustrates the obvious fact i drive at but supplementary to this it has hypothetically occurred to me that as ordinary fish possess what is called a swimming bladder in them capable at will of distension or contraction and as the sperm whale as far as i know has no such provision in him considering too the otherwise inexplicable manner in which he now depresses his head altogether beneath the surface and anon swims with it high elevated out of the water considering the unobstructed elasticity of its envelope considering the unique interior of his head it has hypothetically occurred to me i say that those mystical lungcelled honeycombs there may possibly have some hitherto unknown and unsuspected connexion with the outer air so as to be susceptible to atmospheric distension and contraction if this be so fancy the irresistibleness of that might to which the most impalpable and destructive of all elements contributes ,MobyDick or The Whale
now mark unerringly impelling this dead impregnable uninjurable wall and this most buoyant thing within there swims behind it all a mass of tremendous life only to be adequately estimated as piled wood isby the cord and all obedient to one volition as the smallest insect so that when i shall hereafter detail to you all the specialities and concentrations of potency everywhere lurking in this expansive monster when i shall show you some of his more inconsiderable braining feats i trust you will have renounced all ignorant incredulity and be ready to abide by this that though the sperm whale stove a passage through the isthmus of darien and mixed the atlantic with the pacific you would not elevate one hair of your eyebrow for unless you own the whale you are but a provincial and sentimentalist in truth but clear truth is a thing for salamander giants only to encounter how small the chances for the provincials then what befell the weakling youth lifting the dread goddesss veil at lais ,MobyDick or The Whale
regarding the sperm whales head as a solid oblong you may on an inclined plane sideways divide it into two quoins whereof the lower is the bony structure forming the cranium and jaws and the upper an unctuous mass wholly free from bones its broad forward end forming the expanded vertical apparent forehead of the whale at the middle of the forehead horizontally subdivide this upper quoin and then you have two almost equal parts which before were naturally divided by an internal wall of a thick tendinous substance ,MobyDick or The Whale
quoin is not a euclidean term it belongs to the pure nautical mathematics i know not that it has been defined before a quoin is a solid which differs from a wedge in having its sharp end formed by the steep inclination of one side instead of the mutual tapering of both sides ,MobyDick or The Whale
the lower subdivided part called the junk is one immense honeycomb of oil formed by the crossing and recrossing into ten thousand infiltrated cells of tough elastic white fibres throughout its whole extent the upper part known as the case may be regarded as the great heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale and as that famous great tierce is mystically carved in front so the whales vast plaited forehead forms innumerable strange devices for the emblematical adornment of his wondrous tun moreover as that of heidelburgh was always replenished with the most excellent of the wines of the rhenish valleys so the tun of the whale contains by far the most precious of all his oily vintages namely the highlyprized spermaceti in its absolutely pure limpid and odoriferous state nor is this precious substance found unalloyed in any other part of the creature though in life it remains perfectly fluid yet upon exposure to the air after death it soon begins to concrete sending forth beautiful crystalline shoots as when the first thin delicate ice is just forming in water a large whales case generally yields about five hundred gallons of sperm though from unavoidable circumstances considerable of it is spilled leaks and dribbles away or is otherwise irrevocably lost in the ticklish business of securing what you can ,MobyDick or The Whale
i know not with what fine and costly material the heidelburgh tun was coated within but in superlative richness that coating could not possibly have compared with the silken pearlcoloured membrane like the lining of a fine pelisse forming the inner surface of the sperm whales case ,MobyDick or The Whale
it will have been seen that the heidelburgh tun of the sperm whale embraces the entire length of the entire top of the head and sinceas has been elsewhere set forththe head embraces one third of the whole length of the creature then setting that length down at eighty feet for a good sized whale you have more than twentysix feet for the depth of the tun when it is lengthwise hoisted up and down against a ships side ,MobyDick or The Whale
as in decapitating the whale the operators instrument is brought close to the spot where an entrance is subsequently forced into the spermaceti magazine he has therefore to be uncommonly heedful lest a careless untimely stroke should invade the sanctuary and wastingly let out its invaluable contents it is this decapitated end of the head also which is at last elevated out of the water and retained in that position by the enormous cutting tackles whose hempen combinations on one side make quite a wilderness of ropes in that quarter ,MobyDick or The Whale
nimble as a cat tashtego mounts aloft and without altering his erect posture runs straight out upon the overhanging mainyardarm to the part where it exactly projects over the hoisted tun he has carried with him a light tackle called a whip consisting of only two parts travelling through a singlesheaved block securing this block so that it hangs down from the yardarm he swings one end of the rope till it is caught and firmly held by a hand on deck then handoverhand down the other part the indian drops through the air till dexterously he lands on the summit of the head therestill high elevated above the rest of the company to whom he vivaciously crieshe seems some turkish muezzin calling the good people to prayers from the top of a tower a shorthandled sharp spade being sent up to him he diligently searches for the proper place to begin breaking into the tun in this business he proceeds very heedfully like a treasurehunter in some old house sounding the walls to find where the gold is masoned in by the time this cautious search is over a stout ironbound bucket precisely like a wellbucket has been attached to one end of the whip while the other end being stretched across the deck is there held by two or three alert hands these last now hoist the bucket within grasp of the indian to whom another person has reached up a very long pole inserting this pole into the bucket tashtego downward guides the bucket into the tun till it entirely disappears then giving the word to the seamen at the whip up comes the bucket again all bubbling like a dairymaids pail of new milk carefully lowered from its height the fullfreighted vessel is caught by an appointed hand and quickly emptied into a large tub then remounting aloft it again goes through the same round until the deep cistern will yield no more towards the end tashtego has to ram his long pole harder and harder and deeper and deeper into the tun until some twenty feet of the pole have gone down ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the people of the pequod had been baling some time in this way several tubs had been filled with the fragrant sperm when all at once a queer accident happened whether it was that tashtego that wild indian was so heedless and reckless as to let go for a moment his onehanded hold on the great cabled tackles suspending the head or whether the place where he stood was so treacherous and oozy or whether the evil one himself would have it to fall out so without stating his particular reasons how it was exactly there is no telling now but on a sudden as the eightieth or ninetieth bucket came suckingly upmy god poor tashtegolike the twin reciprocating bucket in a veritable well dropped headforemost down into this great tun of heidelburgh and with a horrible oily gurgling went clean out of sight ,MobyDick or The Whale
man overboard cried daggoo who amid the general consternation first came to his senses swing the bucket this way and putting one foot into it so as the better to secure his slippery handhold on the whip itself the hoisters ran him high up to the top of the head almost before tashtego could have reached its interior bottom meantime there was a terrible tumult looking over the side they saw the before lifeless head throbbing and heaving just below the surface of the sea as if that moment seized with some momentous idea whereas it was only the poor indian unconsciously revealing by those struggles the perilous depth to which he had sunk ,MobyDick or The Whale
at this instant while daggoo on the summit of the head was clearing the whipwhich had somehow got foul of the great cutting tacklesa sharp cracking noise was heard and to the unspeakable horror of all one of the two enormous hooks suspending the head tore out and with a vast vibration the enormous mass sideways swung till the drunk ship reeled and shook as if smitten by an iceberg the one remaining hook upon which the entire strain now depended seemed every instant to be on the point of giving way an event still more likely from the violent motions of the head ,MobyDick or The Whale
come down come down yelled the seamen to daggoo but with one hand holding on to the heavy tackles so that if the head should drop he would still remain suspended the negro having cleared the foul line rammed down the bucket into the now collapsed well meaning that the buried harpooneer should grasp it and so be hoisted out ,MobyDick or The Whale
almost in the same instant with a thunderboom the enormous mass dropped into the sea like niagaras tablerock into the whirlpool the suddenly relieved hull rolled away from it to far down her glittering copper and all caught their breath as half swingingnow over the sailors heads and now over the waterdaggoo through a thick mist of spray was dimly beheld clinging to the pendulous tackles while poor buriedalive tashtego was sinking utterly down to the bottom of the sea but hardly had the blinding vapor cleared away when a naked figure with a boardingsword in his hand was for one swift moment seen hovering over the bulwarks the next a loud splash announced that my brave queequeg had dived to the rescue one packed rush was made to the side and every eye counted every ripple as moment followed moment and no sign of either the sinker or the diver could be seen some hands now jumped into a boat alongside and pushed a little off from the ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
ha ha cried daggoo all at once from his now quiet swinging perch overhead and looking further off from the side we saw an arm thrust upright from the blue waves a sight strange to see as an arm thrust forth from the grass over a grave ,MobyDick or The Whale
both bothit is bothcried daggoo again with a joyful shout and soon after queequeg was seen boldly striking out with one hand and with the other clutching the long hair of the indian drawn into the waiting boat they were quickly brought to the deck but tashtego was long in coming to and queequeg did not look very brisk ,MobyDick or The Whale
now how had this noble rescue been accomplished why diving after the slowly descending head queequeg with his keen sword had made side lunges near its bottom so as to scuttle a large hole there then dropping his sword had thrust his long arm far inwards and upwards and so hauled out poor tash by the head he averred that upon first thrusting in for him a leg was presented but well knowing that that was not as it ought to be and might occasion great troublehe had thrust back the leg and by a dexterous heave and toss had wrought a somerset upon the indian so that with the next trial he came forth in the good old wayhead foremost as for the great head itself that was doing as well as could be expected ,MobyDick or The Whale
and thus through the courage and great skill in obstetrics of queequeg the deliverance or rather delivery of tashtego was successfully accomplished in the teeth too of the most untoward and apparently hopeless impediments which is a lesson by no means to be forgotten midwifery should be taught in the same course with fencing and boxing riding and rowing ,MobyDick or The Whale
i know that this queer adventure of the gayheaders will be sure to seem incredible to some landsmen though they themselves may have either seen or heard of some ones falling into a cistern ashore an accident which not seldom happens and with much less reason too than the indians considering the exceeding slipperiness of the curb of the sperm whales well ,MobyDick or The Whale
but peradventure it may be sagaciously urged how is this we thought the tissued infiltrated head of the sperm whale was the lightest and most corky part about him and yet thou makest it sink in an element of a far greater specific gravity than itself we have thee there not at all but i have ye for at the time poor tash fell in the case had been nearly emptied of its lighter contents leaving little but the dense tendinous wall of the wella double welded hammered substance as i have before said much heavier than the sea water and a lump of which sinks in it like lead almost but the tendency to rapid sinking in this substance was in the present instance materially counteracted by the other parts of the head remaining undetached from it so that it sank very slowly and deliberately indeed affording queequeg a fair chance for performing his agile obstetrics on the run as you may say yes it was a running delivery so it was ,MobyDick or The Whale
now had tashtego perished in that head it had been a very precious perishing smothered in the very whitest and daintiest of fragrant spermaceti coffined hearsed and tombed in the secret inner chamber and sanctum sanctorum of the whale only one sweeter end can readily be recalledthe delicious death of an ohio honeyhunter who seeking honey in the crotch of a hollow tree found such exceeding store of it that leaning too far over it sucked him in so that he died embalmed how many think ye have likewise fallen into platos honey head and sweetly perished there ,MobyDick or The Whale
to scan the lines of his face or feel the bumps on the head of this leviathan this is a thing which no physiognomist or phrenologist has as yet undertaken such an enterprise would seem almost as hopeful as for lavater to have scrutinized the wrinkles on the rock of gibraltar or for gall to have mounted a ladder and manipulated the dome of the pantheon still in that famous work of his lavater not only treats of the various faces of men but also attentively studies the faces of horses birds serpents and fish and dwells in detail upon the modifications of expression discernible therein nor have gall and his disciple spurzheim failed to throw out some hints touching the phrenological characteristics of other beings than man therefore though i am but ill qualified for a pioneer in the application of these two semisciences to the whale i will do my endeavor i try all things i achieve what i can ,MobyDick or The Whale
physiognomically regarded the sperm whale is an anomalous creature he has no proper nose and since the nose is the central and most conspicuous of the features and since it perhaps most modifies and finally controls their combined expression hence it would seem that its entire absence as an external appendage must very largely affect the countenance of the whale for as in landscape gardening a spire cupola monument or tower of some sort is deemed almost indispensable to the completion of the scene so no face can be physiognomically in keeping without the elevated openwork belfry of the nose dash the nose from phidiass marble jove and what a sorry remainder nevertheless leviathan is of so mighty a magnitude all his proportions are so stately that the same deficiency which in the sculptured jove were hideous in him is no blemish at all nay it is an added grandeur a nose to the whale would have been impertinent as on your physiognomical voyage you sail round his vast head in your jollyboat your noble conceptions of him are never insulted by the reflection that he has a nose to be pulled a pestilent conceit which so often will insist upon obtruding even when beholding the mightiest royal beadle on his throne ,MobyDick or The Whale
in thought a fine human brow is like the east when troubled with the morning in the repose of the pasture the curled brow of the bull has a touch of the grand in it pushing heavy cannon up mountain defiles the elephants brow is majestic human or animal the mystical brow is as that great golden seal affixed by the german emperors to their decrees it signifiesgod done this day by my hand but in most creatures nay in man himself very often the brow is but a mere strip of alpine land lying along the snow line few are the foreheads which like shakespeares or melancthons rise so high and descend so low that the eyes themselves seem clear eternal tideless mountain lakes and all above them in the foreheads wrinkles you seem to track the antlered thoughts descending there to drink as the highland hunters track the snow prints of the deer but in the great sperm whale this high and mighty godlike dignity inherent in the brow is so immensely amplified that gazing on it in that full front view you feel the deity and the dread powers more forcibly than in beholding any other object in living nature for you see no one point precisely not one distinct feature is revealed no nose eyes ears or mouth no face he has none proper nothing but that one broad firmament of a forehead pleated with riddles dumbly lowering with the doom of boats and ships and men nor in profile does this wondrous brow diminish though that way viewed its grandeur does not domineer upon you so in profile you plainly perceive that horizontal semicrescentic depression in the foreheads middle which in man is lavaters mark of genius ,MobyDick or The Whale
but how genius in the sperm whale has the sperm whale ever written a book spoken a speech no his great genius is declared in his doing nothing particular to prove it it is moreover declared in his pyramidical silence and this reminds me that had the great sperm whale been known to the young orient world he would have been deified by their childmagian thoughts they deified the crocodile of the nile because the crocodile is tongueless and the sperm whale has no tongue or at least it is so exceedingly small as to be incapable of protrusion if hereafter any highly cultured poetical nation shall lure back to their birthright the merry mayday gods of old and livingly enthrone them again in the now egotistical sky in the now unhaunted hill then be sure exalted to joves high seat the great sperm whale shall lord it ,MobyDick or The Whale
champollion deciphered the wrinkled granite hieroglyphics but there is no champollion to decipher the egypt of every mans and every beings face physiognomy like every other human science is but a passing fable if then sir william jones who read in thirty languages could not read the simplest peasants face in its profounder and more subtle meanings how may unlettered ishmael hope to read the awful chaldee of the sperm whales brow i but put that brow before you read it if you can ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the fullgrown creature the skull will measure at least twenty feet in length unhinge the lower jaw and the side view of this skull is as the side of a moderately inclined plane resting throughout on a level base but in lifeas we have elsewhere seenthis inclined plane is angularly filled up and almost squared by the enormous superincumbent mass of the junk and sperm at the high end the skull forms a crater to bed that part of the mass while under the long floor of this craterin another cavity seldom exceeding ten inches in length and as many in depthreposes the mere handful of this monsters brain the brain is at least twenty feet from his apparent forehead in life it is hidden away behind its vast outworks like the innermost citadel within the amplified fortifications of quebec so like a choice casket is it secreted in him that i have known some whalemen who peremptorily deny that the sperm whale has any other brain than that palpable semblance of one formed by the cubicyards of his sperm magazine lying in strange folds courses and convolutions to their apprehensions it seems more in keeping with the idea of his general might to regard that mystic part of him as the seat of his intelligence ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is plain then that phrenologically the head of this leviathan in the creatures living intact state is an entire delusion as for his true brain you can then see no indications of it nor feel any the whale like all things that are mighty wears a false brow to the common world ,MobyDick or The Whale
if you unload his skull of its spermy heaps and then take a rear view of its rear end which is the high end you will be struck by its resemblance to the human skull beheld in the same situation and from the same point of view indeed place this reversed skull scaled down to the human magnitude among a plate of mens skulls and you would involuntarily confound it with them and remarking the depressions on one part of its summit in phrenological phrase you would saythis man had no selfesteem and no veneration and by those negations considered along with the affirmative fact of his prodigious bulk and power you can best form to yourself the truest though not the most exhilarating conception of what the most exalted potency is ,MobyDick or The Whale
but if from the comparative dimensions of the whales proper brain you deem it incapable of being adequately charted then i have another idea for you if you attentively regard almost any quadrupeds spine you will be struck with the resemblance of its vertebr to a strung necklace of dwarfed skulls all bearing rudimental resemblance to the skull proper it is a german conceit that the vertebr are absolutely undeveloped skulls but the curious external resemblance i take it the germans were not the first men to perceive a foreign friend once pointed it out to me in the skeleton of a foe he had slain and with the vertebr of which he was inlaying in a sort of bassorelievo the beaked prow of his canoe now i consider that the phrenologists have omitted an important thing in not pushing their investigations from the cerebellum through the spinal canal for i believe that much of a mans character will be found betokened in his backbone i would rather feel your spine than your skull whoever you are a thin joist of a spine never yet upheld a full and noble soul i rejoice in my spine as in the firm audacious staff of that flag which i fling half out to the world ,MobyDick or The Whale
apply this spinal branch of phrenology to the sperm whale his cranial cavity is continuous with the first neckvertebra and in that vertebra the bottom of the spinal canal will measure ten inches across being eight in height and of a triangular figure with the base downwards as it passes through the remaining vertebr the canal tapers in size but for a considerable distance remains of large capacity now of course this canal is filled with much the same strangely fibrous substancethe spinal cordas the brain and directly communicates with the brain and what is still more for many feet after emerging from the brains cavity the spinal cord remains of an undecreasing girth almost equal to that of the brain under all these circumstances would it be unreasonable to survey and map out the whales spine phrenologically for viewed in this light the wonderful comparative smallness of his brain proper is more than compensated by the wonderful comparative magnitude of his spinal cord ,MobyDick or The Whale
but leaving this hint to operate as it may with the phrenologists i would merely assume the spinal theory for a moment in reference to the sperm whales hump this august hump if i mistake not rises over one of the larger vertebr and is therefore in some sort the outer convex mould of it from its relative situation then i should call this high hump the organ of firmness or indomitableness in the sperm whale and that the great monster is indomitable you will yet have reason to know ,MobyDick or The Whale
at one time the greatest whaling people in the world the dutch and germans are now among the least but here and there at very wide intervals of latitude and longitude you still occasionally meet with their flag in the pacific ,MobyDick or The Whale
for some reason the jungfrau seemed quite eager to pay her respects while yet some distance from the pequod she rounded to and dropping a boat her captain was impelled towards us impatiently standing in the bows instead of the stern ,MobyDick or The Whale
not that said stubb no no its a coffeepot mr starbuck hes coming off to make us our coffee is the yarman dont you see that big tin can there alongside of himthats his boiling water oh hes all right is the yarman ,MobyDick or The Whale
however curious it may seem for an oilship to be borrowing oil on the whaleground and however much it may invertedly contradict the old proverb about carrying coals to newcastle yet sometimes such a thing really happens and in the present case captain derick de deer did indubitably conduct a lampfeeder as flask did declare ,MobyDick or The Whale
as he mounted the deck ahab abruptly accosted him without at all heeding what he had in his hand but in his broken lingo the german soon evinced his complete ignorance of the white whale immediately turning the conversation to his lampfeeder and oil can with some remarks touching his having to turn into his hammock at night in profound darknesshis last drop of bremen oil being gone and not a single flyingfish yet captured to supply the deficiency concluding by hinting that his ship was indeed what in the fishery is technically called a clean one that is an empty one well deserving the name of jungfrau or the virgin ,MobyDick or The Whale
his necessities supplied derick departed but he had not gained his ships side when whales were almost simultaneously raised from the mastheads of both vessels and so eager for the chase was derick that without pausing to put his oilcan and lampfeeder aboard he slewed round his boat and made after the leviathan lampfeeders ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the game having risen to leeward he and the other three german boats that soon followed him had considerably the start of the pequods keels there were eight whales an average pod aware of their danger they were going all abreast with great speed straight before the wind rubbing their flanks as closely as so many spans of horses in harness they left a great wide wake as though continually unrolling a great wide parchment upon the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
full in this rapid wake and many fathoms in the rear swam a huge humped old bull which by his comparatively slow progress as well as by the unusual yellowish incrustations overgrowing him seemed afflicted with the jaundice or some other infirmity whether this whale belonged to the pod in advance seemed questionable for it is not customary for such venerable leviathans to be at all social nevertheless he stuck to their wake though indeed their back water must have retarded him because the whitebone or swell at his broad muzzle was a dashed one like the swell formed when two hostile currents meet his spout was short slow and laborious coming forth with a choking sort of gush and spending itself in torn shreds followed by strange subterranean commotions in him which seemed to have egress at his other buried extremity causing the waters behind him to upbubble ,MobyDick or The Whale
whos got some paregoric said stubb he has the stomachache im afraid lord think of having half an acre of stomachache adverse winds are holding mad christmas in him boys its the first foul wind i ever knew to blow from astern but look did ever whale yaw so before it must be hes lost his tiller ,MobyDick or The Whale
as an overladen indiaman bearing down the hindostan coast with a deck load of frightened horses careens buries rolls and wallows on her way so did this old whale heave his aged bulk and now and then partly turning over on his cumbrous ribends expose the cause of his devious wake in the unnatural stump of his starboard fin whether he had lost that fin in battle or had been born without it it were hard to say ,MobyDick or The Whale
with one intent all the combined rival boats were pointed for this one fish because not only was he the largest and therefore the most valuable whale but he was nearest to them and the other whales were going with such great velocity moreover as almost to defy pursuit for the time at this juncture the pequods keels had shot by the three german boats last lowered but from the great start he had had dericks boat still led the chase though every moment neared by his foreign rivals the only thing they feared was that from being already so nigh to his mark he would be enabled to dart his iron before they could completely overtake and pass him as for derick he seemed quite confident that this would be the case and occasionally with a deriding gesture shook his lampfeeder at the other boats ,MobyDick or The Whale

at this moment derick was in the act of pitching his lampfeeder at the advancing boats and also his oilcan perhaps with the double view of retarding his rivals way and at the same time economically accelerating his own by the momentary impetus of the backward toss ,MobyDick or The Whale
the unmannerly dutch dogger cried stubb pull now men like fifty thousand lineofbattleship loads of redhaired devils what dye say tashtego are you the man to snap your spine in twoandtwenty pieces for the honor of old gayhead what dye say ,MobyDick or The Whale
fiercely but evenly incited by the taunts of the german the pequods three boats now began ranging almost abreast and so disposed momentarily neared him in that fine loose chivalrous attitude of the headsman when drawing near to his prey the three mates stood up proudly occasionally backing the after oarsman with an exhilarating cry of there she slides now hurrah for the whiteash breeze down with the yarman sail over him ,MobyDick or The Whale
but so decided an original start had derick had that spite of all their gallantry he would have proved the victor in this race had not a righteous judgment descended upon him in a crab which caught the blade of his midship oarsman while this clumsy lubber was striving to free his whiteash and while in consequence dericks boat was nigh to capsizing and he thundering away at his men in a mighty ragethat was a good time for starbuck stubb and flask with a shout they took a mortal start forwards and slantingly ranged up on the germans quarter an instant more and all four boats were diagonically in the whales immediate wake while stretching from them on both sides was the foaming swell that he made ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a terrific most pitiable and maddening sight the whale was now going head out and sending his spout before him in a continual tormented jet while his one poor fin beat his side in an agony of fright now to this hand now to that he yawed in his faltering flight and still at every billow that he broke he spasmodically sank in the sea or sideways rolled towards the sky his one beating fin so have i seen a bird with clipped wing making affrighted broken circles in the air vainly striving to escape the piratical hawks but the bird has a voice and with plaintive cries will make known her fear but the fear of this vast dumb brute of the sea was chained up and enchanted in him he had no voice save that choking respiration through his spiracle and this made the sight of him unspeakably pitiable while still in his amazing bulk portcullis jaw and omnipotent tail there was enough to appal the stoutest man who so pitied ,MobyDick or The Whale
seeing now that but a very few moments more would give the pequods boats the advantage and rather than be thus foiled of his game derick chose to hazard what to him must have seemed a most unusually long dart ere the last chance would for ever escape ,MobyDick or The Whale
but no sooner did his harpooneer stand up for the stroke than all three tigersqueequeg tashtego daggooinstinctively sprang to their feet and standing in a diagonal row simultaneously pointed their barbs and darted over the head of the german harpooneer their three nantucket irons entered the whale blinding vapors of foam and whitefire the three boats in the first fury of the whales headlong rush bumped the germans aside with such force that both derick and his baffled harpooneer were spilled out and sailed over by the three flying keels ,MobyDick or The Whale
dont be afraid my butterboxes cried stubb casting a passing glance upon them as he shot by yell be picked up presentlyall righti saw some sharks asternst bernards dogs you knowrelieve distressed travellers hurrah this is the way to sail now every keel a sunbeam hurrahhere we go like three tin kettles at the tail of a mad cougar this puts me in mind of fastening to an elephant in a tilbury on a plainmakes the wheelspokes fly boys when you fasten to him that way and theres danger of being pitched out too when you strike a hill hurrah this is the way a fellow feels when hes going to davy jonesall a rush down an endless inclined plane hurrah this whale carries the everlasting mail ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the monsters run was a brief one giving a sudden gasp he tumultuously sounded with a grating rush the three lines flew round the loggerheads with such a force as to gouge deep grooves in them while so fearful were the harpooneers that this rapid sounding would soon exhaust the lines that using all their dexterous might they caught repeated smoking turns with the rope to hold on till at lastowing to the perpendicular strain from the leadlined chocks of the boats whence the three ropes went straight down into the bluethe gunwales of the bows were almost even with the water while the three sterns tilted high in the air and the whale soon ceasing to sound for some time they remained in that attitude fearful of expending more line though the position was a little ticklish but though boats have been taken down and lost in this way yet it is this holding on as it is called this hooking up by the sharp barbs of his live flesh from the back this it is that often torments the leviathan into soon rising again to meet the sharp lance of his foes yet not to speak of the peril of the thing it is to be doubted whether this course is always the best for it is but reasonable to presume that the longer the stricken whale stays under water the more he is exhausted because owing to the enormous surface of himin a full grown sperm whale something less than  square feetthe pressure of the water is immense we all know what an astonishing atmospheric weight we ourselves stand up under even here aboveground in the air how vast then the burden of a whale bearing on his back a column of two hundred fathoms of ocean it must at least equal the weight of fifty atmospheres one whaleman has estimated it at the weight of twenty lineofbattle ships with all their guns and stores and men on board ,MobyDick or The Whale
as the three boats lay there on that gently rolling sea gazing down into its eternal blue noon and as not a single groan or cry of any sort nay not so much as a ripple or a bubble came up from its depths what landsman would have thought that beneath all that silence and placidity the utmost monster of the seas was writhing and wrenching in agony not eight inches of perpendicular rope were visible at the bows seems it credible that by three such thin threads the great leviathan was suspended like the big weight to an eight day clock suspended and to what to three bits of board is this the creature of whom it was once so triumphantly saidcanst thou fill his skin with barbed irons or his head with fishspears the sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold the spear the dart nor the habergeon he esteemeth iron as straw the arrow cannot make him flee darts are counted as stubble he laugheth at the shaking of a spear this the creature this he oh that unfulfilments should follow the prophets for with the strength of a thousand thighs in his tail leviathan had run his head under the mountains of the sea to hide him from the pequods fishspears ,MobyDick or The Whale
in that sloping afternoon sunlight the shadows that the three boats sent down beneath the surface must have been long enough and broad enough to shade half xerxes army who can tell how appalling to the wounded whale must have been such huge phantoms flitting over his head ,MobyDick or The Whale
stand by men he stirs cried starbuck as the three lines suddenly vibrated in the water distinctly conducting upwards to them as by magnetic wires the life and death throbs of the whale so that every oarsman felt them in his seat the next moment relieved in great part from the downward strain at the bows the boats gave a sudden bounce upwards as a small icefield will when a dense herd of white bears are scared from it into the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
the lines of which hardly an instant before not one hands breadth could have been gained were now in long quick coils flung back all dripping into the boats and soon the whale broke water within two ships lengths of the hunters ,MobyDick or The Whale
his motions plainly denoted his extreme exhaustion in most land animals there are certain valves or floodgates in many of their veins whereby when wounded the blood is in some degree at least instantly shut off in certain directions not so with the whale one of whose peculiarities it is to have an entire nonvalvular structure of the bloodvessels so that when pierced even by so small a point as a harpoon a deadly drain is at once begun upon his whole arterial system and when this is heightened by the extraordinary pressure of water at a great distance below the surface his life may be said to pour from him in incessant streams yet so vast is the quantity of blood in him and so distant and numerous its interior fountains that he will keep thus bleeding and bleeding for a considerable period even as in a drought a river will flow whose source is in the wellsprings of faroff and undiscernible hills even now when the boats pulled upon this whale and perilously drew over his swaying flukes and the lances were darted into him they were followed by steady jets from the new made wound which kept continually playing while the natural spouthole in his head was only at intervals however rapid sending its affrighted moisture into the air from this last vent no blood yet came because no vital part of him had thus far been struck his life as they significantly call it was untouched ,MobyDick or The Whale
as the boats now more closely surrounded him the whole upper part of his form with much of it that is ordinarily submerged was plainly revealed his eyes or rather the places where his eyes had been were beheld as strange misgrown masses gather in the knotholes of the noblest oaks when prostrate so from the points which the whales eyes had once occupied now protruded blind bulbs horribly pitiable to see but pity there was none for all his old age and his one arm and his blind eyes he must die the death and be murdered in order to light the gay bridals and other merrymakings of men and also to illuminate the solemn churches that preach unconditional inoffensiveness by all to all still rolling in his blood at last he partially disclosed a strangely discoloured bunch or protuberance the size of a bushel low down on the flank ,MobyDick or The Whale
but humane starbuck was too late at the instant of the dart an ulcerous jet shot from this cruel wound and goaded by it into more than sufferable anguish the whale now spouting thick blood with swift fury blindly darted at the craft bespattering them and their glorying crews all over with showers of gore capsizing flasks boat and marring the bows it was his death stroke for by this time so spent was he by loss of blood that he helplessly rolled away from the wreck he had made lay panting on his side impotently flapped with his stumped fin then over and over slowly revolved like a waning world turned up the white secrets of his belly lay like a log and died it was most piteous that last expiring spout as when by unseen hands the water is gradually drawn off from some mighty fountain and with halfstifled melancholy gurglings the spraycolumn lowers and lowers to the groundso the last long dying spout of the whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
soon while the crews were awaiting the arrival of the ship the body showed symptoms of sinking with all its treasures unrifled immediately by starbucks orders lines were secured to it at different points so that ere long every boat was a buoy the sunken whale being suspended a few inches beneath them by the cords by very heedful management when the ship drew nigh the whale was transferred to her side and was strongly secured there by the stiffest flukechains for it was plain that unless artificially upheld the body would at once sink to the bottom ,MobyDick or The Whale
it so chanced that almost upon first cutting into him with the spade the entire length of a corroded harpoon was found imbedded in his flesh on the lower part of the bunch before described but as the stumps of harpoons are frequently found in the dead bodies of captured whales with the flesh perfectly healed around them and no prominence of any kind to denote their place therefore there must needs have been some other unknown reason in the present case fully to account for the ulceration alluded to but still more curious was the fact of a lancehead of stone being found in him not far from the buried iron the flesh perfectly firm about it who had darted that stone lance and when it might have been darted by some nor west indian long before america was discovered ,MobyDick or The Whale
what other marvels might have been rummaged out of this monstrous cabinet there is no telling but a sudden stop was put to further discoveries by the ships being unprecedentedly dragged over sideways to the sea owing to the bodys immensely increasing tendency to sink however starbuck who had the ordering of affairs hung on to it to the last hung on to it so resolutely indeed that when at length the ship would have been capsized if still persisting in locking arms with the body then when the command was given to break clear from it such was the immovable strain upon the timberheads to which the flukechains and cables were fastened that it was impossible to cast them off meantime everything in the pequod was aslant to cross to the other side of the deck was like walking up the steep gabled roof of a house the ship groaned and gasped many of the ivory inlayings of her bulwarks and cabins were started from their places by the unnatural dislocation in vain handspikes and crows were brought to bear upon the immovable flukechains to pry them adrift from the timberheads and so low had the whale now settled that the submerged ends could not be at all approached while every moment whole tons of ponderosity seemed added to the sinking bulk and the ship seemed on the point of going over ,MobyDick or The Whale
hold on hold on wont ye cried stubb to the body dont be in such a devil of a hurry to sink by thunder men we must do something or go for it no use prying there avast i say with your handspikes and run one of ye for a prayer book and a penknife and cut the big chains ,MobyDick or The Whale
knife aye aye cried queequeg and seizing the carpenters heavy hatchet he leaned out of a porthole and steel to iron began slashing at the largest flukechains but a few strokes full of sparks were given when the exceeding strain effected the rest with a terrific snap every fastening went adrift the ship righted the carcase sank ,MobyDick or The Whale
now this occasional inevitable sinking of the recently killed sperm whale is a very curious thing nor has any fisherman yet adequately accounted for it usually the dead sperm whale floats with great buoyancy with its side or belly considerably elevated above the surface if the only whales that thus sank were old meagre and brokenhearted creatures their pads of lard diminished and all their bones heavy and rheumatic then you might with some reason assert that this sinking is caused by an uncommon specific gravity in the fish so sinking consequent upon this absence of buoyant matter in him but it is not so for young whales in the highest health and swelling with noble aspirations prematurely cut off in the warm flush and may of life with all their panting lard about them even these brawny buoyant heroes do sometimes sink ,MobyDick or The Whale
be it said however that the sperm whale is far less liable to this accident than any other species where one of that sort go down twenty right whales do this difference in the species is no doubt imputable in no small degree to the greater quantity of bone in the right whale his venetian blinds alone sometimes weighing more than a ton from this incumbrance the sperm whale is wholly free but there are instances where after the lapse of many hours or several days the sunken whale again rises more buoyant than in life but the reason of this is obvious gases are generated in him he swells to a prodigious magnitude becomes a sort of animal balloon a lineofbattle ship could hardly keep him under then in the shore whaling on soundings among the bays of new zealand when a right whale gives token of sinking they fasten buoys to him with plenty of rope so that when the body has gone down they know where to look for it when it shall have ascended again ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was not long after the sinking of the body that a cry was heard from the pequods mastheads announcing that the jungfrau was again lowering her boats though the only spout in sight was that of a finback belonging to the species of uncapturable whales because of its incredible power of swimming nevertheless the finbacks spout is so similar to the sperm whales that by unskilful fishermen it is often mistaken for it and consequently derick and all his host were now in valiant chase of this unnearable brute the virgin crowding all sail made after her four young keels and thus they all disappeared far to leeward still in bold hopeful chase ,MobyDick or The Whale
the more i dive into this matter of whaling and push my researches up to the very springhead of it so much the more am i impressed with its great honorableness and antiquity and especially when i find so many great demigods and heroes prophets of all sorts who one way or other have shed distinction upon it i am transported with the reflection that i myself belong though but subordinately to so emblazoned a fraternity ,MobyDick or The Whale
the gallant perseus a son of jupiter was the first whaleman and to the eternal honor of our calling be it said that the first whale attacked by our brotherhood was not killed with any sordid intent those were the knightly days of our profession when we only bore arms to succor the distressed and not to fill mens lampfeeders every one knows the fine story of perseus and andromeda how the lovely andromeda the daughter of a king was tied to a rock on the seacoast and as leviathan was in the very act of carrying her off perseus the prince of whalemen intrepidly advancing harpooned the monster and delivered and married the maid it was an admirable artistic exploit rarely achieved by the best harpooneers of the present day inasmuch as this leviathan was slain at the very first dart and let no man doubt this arkite story for in the ancient joppa now jaffa on the syrian coast in one of the pagan temples there stood for many ages the vast skeleton of a whale which the citys legends and all the inhabitants asserted to be the identical bones of the monster that perseus slew when the romans took joppa the same skeleton was carried to italy in triumph what seems most singular and suggestively important in this story is this it was from joppa that jonah set sail ,MobyDick or The Whale
akin to the adventure of perseus and andromedaindeed by some supposed to be indirectly derived from itis that famous story of st george and the dragon which dragon i maintain to have been a whale for in many old chronicles whales and dragons are strangely jumbled together and often stand for each other thou art as a lion of the waters and as a dragon of the sea saith ezekiel hereby plainly meaning a whale in truth some versions of the bible use that word itself besides it would much subtract from the glory of the exploit had st george but encountered a crawling reptile of the land instead of doing battle with the great monster of the deep any man may kill a snake but only a perseus a st george a coffin have the heart in them to march boldly up to a whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
let not the modern paintings of this scene mislead us for though the creature encountered by that valiant whaleman of old is vaguely represented of a griffinlike shape and though the battle is depicted on land and the saint on horseback yet considering the great ignorance of those times when the true form of the whale was unknown to artists and considering that as in perseus case st georges whale might have crawled up out of the sea on the beach and considering that the animal ridden by st george might have been only a large seal or seahorse bearing all this in mind it will not appear altogether incompatible with the sacred legend and the ancientest draughts of the scene to hold this socalled dragon no other than the great leviathan himself in fact placed before the strict and piercing truth this whole story will fare like that fish flesh and fowl idol of the philistines dagon by name who being planted before the ark of israel his horses head and both the palms of his hands fell off from him and only the stump or fishy part of him remained thus then one of our own noble stamp even a whaleman is the tutelary guardian of england and by good rights we harpooneers of nantucket should be enrolled in the most noble order of st george and therefore let not the knights of that honorable company none of whom i venture to say have ever had to do with a whale like their great patron let them never eye a nantucketer with disdain since even in our woollen frocks and tarred trowsers we are much better entitled to st georges decoration than they ,MobyDick or The Whale
whether to admit hercules among us or not concerning this i long remained dubious for though according to the greek mythologies that antique crockett and kit carsonthat brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale still whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him that might be mooted it nowhere appears that he ever actually harpooned his fish unless indeed from the inside nevertheless he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman at any rate the whale caught him if he did not the whale i claim him for one of our clan ,MobyDick or The Whale
but by the best contradictory authorities this grecian story of hercules and the whale is considered to be derived from the still more ancient hebrew story of jonah and the whale and vice vers certainly they are very similar if i claim the demigod then why not the prophet ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor do heroes saints demigods and prophets alone comprise the whole roll of our order our grand master is still to be named for like royal kings of old times we find the head waters of our fraternity in nothing short of the great gods themselves that wondrous oriental story is now to be rehearsed from the shaster which gives us the dread vishnoo one of the three persons in the godhead of the hindoos gives us this divine vishnoo himself for our lordvishnoo who by the first of his ten earthly incarnations has for ever set apart and sanctified the whale when brahma or the god of gods saith the shaster resolved to recreate the world after one of its periodical dissolutions he gave birth to vishnoo to preside over the work but the vedas or mystical books whose perusal would seem to have been indispensable to vishnoo before beginning the creation and which therefore must have contained something in the shape of practical hints to young architects these vedas were lying at the bottom of the waters so vishnoo became incarnate in a whale and sounding down in him to the uttermost depths rescued the sacred volumes was not this vishnoo a whaleman then even as a man who rides a horse is called a horseman ,MobyDick or The Whale
reference was made to the historical story of jonah and the whale in the preceding chapter now some nantucketers rather distrust this historical story of jonah and the whale but then there were some sceptical greeks and romans who standing out from the orthodox pagans of their times equally doubted the story of hercules and the whale and arion and the dolphin and yet their doubting those traditions did not make those traditions one whit the less facts for all that ,MobyDick or The Whale
one old sagharbor whalemans chief reason for questioning the hebrew story was thishe had one of those quaint oldfashioned bibles embellished with curious unscientific plates one of which represented jonahs whale with two spouts in his heada peculiarity only true with respect to a species of the leviathan the right whale and the varieties of that order concerning which the fishermen have this saying a penny roll would choke him his swallow is so very small but to this bishop jebbs anticipative answer is ready it is not necessary hints the bishop that we consider jonah as tombed in the whales belly but as temporarily lodged in some part of his mouth and this seems reasonable enough in the good bishop for truly the right whales mouth would accommodate a couple of whisttables and comfortably seat all the players possibly too jonah might have ensconced himself in a hollow tooth but on second thoughts the right whale is toothless ,MobyDick or The Whale
another reason which sagharbor he went by that name urged for his want of faith in this matter of the prophet was something obscurely in reference to his incarcerated body and the whales gastric juices but this objection likewise falls to the ground because a german exegetist supposes that jonah must have taken refuge in the floating body of a dead whaleeven as the french soldiers in the russian campaign turned their dead horses into tents and crawled into them besides it has been divined by other continental commentators that when jonah was thrown overboard from the joppa ship he straightway effected his escape to another vessel near by some vessel with a whale for a figurehead and i would add possibly called the whale as some craft are nowadays christened the shark the gull the eagle nor have there been wanting learned exegetists who have opined that the whale mentioned in the book of jonah merely meant a lifepreserveran inflated bag of windwhich the endangered prophet swam to and so was saved from a watery doom poor sagharbor therefore seems worsted all round but he had still another reason for his want of faith it was this if i remember right jonah was swallowed by the whale in the mediterranean sea and after three days he was vomited up somewhere within three days journey of nineveh a city on the tigris very much more than three days journey across from the nearest point of the mediterranean coast how is that ,MobyDick or The Whale
but was there no other way for the whale to land the prophet within that short distance of nineveh yes he might have carried him round by the way of the cape of good hope but not to speak of the passage through the whole length of the mediterranean and another passage up the persian gulf and red sea such a supposition would involve the complete circumnavigation of all africa in three days not to speak of the tigris waters near the site of nineveh being too shallow for any whale to swim in besides this idea of jonahs weathering the cape of good hope at so early a day would wrest the honor of the discovery of that great headland from bartholomew diaz its reputed discoverer and so make modern history a liar ,MobyDick or The Whale
but all these foolish arguments of old sagharbor only evinced his foolish pride of reasona thing still more reprehensible in him seeing that he had but little learning except what he had picked up from the sun and the sea i say it only shows his foolish impious pride and abominable devilish rebellion against the reverend clergy for by a portuguese catholic priest this very idea of jonahs going to nineveh via the cape of good hope was advanced as a signal magnification of the general miracle and so it was besides to this day the highly enlightened turks devoutly believe in the historical story of jonah and some three centuries ago an english traveller in old harriss voyages speaks of a turkish mosque built in honor of jonah in which mosque was a miraculous lamp that burnt without any oil ,MobyDick or The Whale
to make them run easily and swiftly the axles of carriages are anointed and for much the same purpose some whalers perform an analogous operation upon their boat they grease the bottom nor is it to be doubted that as such a procedure can do no harm it may possibly be of no contemptible advantage considering that oil and water are hostile that oil is a sliding thing and that the object in view is to make the boat slide bravely queequeg believed strongly in anointing his boat and one morning not long after the german ship jungfrau disappeared took more than customary pains in that occupation crawling under its bottom where it hung over the side and rubbing in the unctuousness as though diligently seeking to insure a crop of hair from the crafts bald keel he seemed to be working in obedience to some particular presentiment nor did it remain unwarranted by the event ,MobyDick or The Whale
nevertheless the boats pursued and stubbs was foremost by great exertion tashtego at last succeeded in planting one iron but the stricken whale without at all sounding still continued his horizontal flight with added fleetness such unintermitted strainings upon the planted iron must sooner or later inevitably extract it it became imperative to lance the flying whale or be content to lose him but to haul the boat up to his flank was impossible he swam so fast and furious what then remained ,MobyDick or The Whale
of all the wondrous devices and dexterities the sleights of hand and countless subtleties to which the veteran whaleman is so often forced none exceed that fine manuvre with the lance called pitchpoling small sword or broad sword in all its exercises boasts nothing like it it is only indispensable with an inveterate running whale its grand fact and feature is the wonderful distance to which the long lance is accurately darted from a violently rocking jerking boat under extreme headway steel and wood included the entire spear is some ten or twelve feet in length the staff is much slighter than that of the harpoon and also of a lighter materialpine it is furnished with a small rope called a warp of considerable length by which it can be hauled back to the hand after darting ,MobyDick or The Whale
but before going further it is important to mention here that though the harpoon may be pitchpoled in the same way with the lance yet it is seldom done and when done is still less frequently successful on account of the greater weight and inferior length of the harpoon as compared with the lance which in effect become serious drawbacks as a general thing therefore you must first get fast to a whale before any pitchpoling comes into play ,MobyDick or The Whale
look now at stubb a man who from his humorous deliberate coolness and equanimity in the direst emergencies was specially qualified to excel in pitchpoling look at him he stands upright in the tossed bow of the flying boat wrapt in fleecy foam the towing whale is forty feet ahead handling the long lance lightly glancing twice or thrice along its length to see if it be exactly straight stubb whistlingly gathers up the coil of the warp in one hand so as to secure its free end in his grasp leaving the rest unobstructed then holding the lance full before his waistbands middle he levels it at the whale when covering him with it he steadily depresses the buttend in his hand thereby elevating the point till the weapon stands fairly balanced upon his palm fifteen feet in the air he minds you somewhat of a juggler balancing a long staff on his chin next moment with a rapid nameless impulse in a superb lofty arch the bright steel spans the foaming distance and quivers in the life spot of the whale instead of sparkling water he now spouts red blood ,MobyDick or The Whale
that drove the spigot out of him cried stubb tis julys immortal fourth all fountains must run wine today would now it were old orleans whiskey or old ohio or unspeakable old monongahela then tashtego lad id have ye hold a canakin to the jet and wed drink round it yea verily hearts alive wed brew choice punch in the spread of his spouthole there and from that live punchbowl quaff the living stuff ,MobyDick or The Whale
again and again to such gamesome talk the dexterous dart is repeated the spear returning to its master like a greyhound held in skilful leash the agonized whale goes into his flurry the towline is slackened and the pitchpoler dropping astern folds his hands and mutely watches the monster die ,MobyDick or The Whale
that for six thousand yearsand no one knows how many millions of ages beforethe great whales should have been spouting all over the sea and sprinkling and mistifying the gardens of the deep as with so many sprinkling or mistifying pots and that for some centuries back thousands of hunters should have been close by the fountain of the whale watching these sprinklings and spoutingsthat all this should be and yet that down to this blessed minute fifteen and a quarter minutes past one oclock pm of this sixteenth day of december ad  it should still remain a problem whether these spoutings are after all really water or nothing but vaporthis is surely a noteworthy thing ,MobyDick or The Whale
let us then look at this matter along with some interesting items contingent every one knows that by the peculiar cunning of their gills the finny tribes in general breathe the air which at all times is combined with the element in which they swim hence a herring or a cod might live a century and never once raise its head above the surface but owing to his marked internal structure which gives him regular lungs like a human beings the whale can only live by inhaling the disengaged air in the open atmosphere wherefore the necessity for his periodical visits to the upper world but he cannot in any degree breathe through his mouth for in his ordinary attitude the sperm whales mouth is buried at least eight feet beneath the surface and what is still more his windpipe has no connexion with his mouth no he breathes through his spiracle alone and this is on the top of his head ,MobyDick or The Whale
if i say that in any creature breathing is only a function indispensable to vitality inasmuch as it withdraws from the air a certain element which being subsequently brought into contact with the blood imparts to the blood its vivifying principle i do not think i shall err though i may possibly use some superfluous scientific words assume it and it follows that if all the blood in a man could be aerated with one breath he might then seal up his nostrils and not fetch another for a considerable time that is to say he would then live without breathing anomalous as it may seem this is precisely the case with the whale who systematically lives by intervals his full hour and more when at the bottom without drawing a single breath or so much as in any way inhaling a particle of air for remember he has no gills how is this between his ribs and on each side of his spine he is supplied with a remarkable involved cretan labyrinth of vermicellilike vessels which vessels when he quits the surface are completely distended with oxygenated blood so that for an hour or more a thousand fathoms in the sea he carries a surplus stock of vitality in him just as the camel crossing the waterless desert carries a surplus supply of drink for future use in its four supplementary stomachs the anatomical fact of this labyrinth is indisputable and that the supposition founded upon it is reasonable and true seems the more cogent to me when i consider the otherwise inexplicable obstinacy of that leviathan in having his spoutings out as the fishermen phrase it this is what i mean if unmolested upon rising to the surface the sperm whale will continue there for a period of time exactly uniform with all his other unmolested risings say he stays eleven minutes and jets seventy times that is respires seventy breaths then whenever he rises again he will be sure to have his seventy breaths over again to a minute now if after he fetches a few breaths you alarm him so that he sounds he will be always dodging up again to make good his regular allowance of air and not till those seventy breaths are told will he finally go down to stay out his full term below remark however that in different individuals these rates are different but in any one they are alike now why should the whale thus insist upon having his spoutings out unless it be to replenish his reservoir of air ere descending for good how obvious is it too that this necessity for the whales rising exposes him to all the fatal hazards of the chase for not by hook or by net could this vast leviathan be caught when sailing a thousand fathoms beneath the sunlight not so much thy skill then o hunter as the great necessities that strike the victory to thee ,MobyDick or The Whale
in man breathing is incessantly going onone breath only serving for two or three pulsations so that whatever other business he has to attend to waking or sleeping breathe he must or die he will but the sperm whale only breathes about one seventh or sunday of his time ,MobyDick or The Whale
it has been said that the whale only breathes through his spouthole if it could truthfully be added that his spouts are mixed with water then i opine we should be furnished with the reason why his sense of smell seems obliterated in him for the only thing about him that at all answers to his nose is that identical spouthole and being so clogged with two elements it could not be expected to have the power of smelling but owing to the mystery of the spoutwhether it be water or whether it be vaporno absolute certainty can as yet be arrived at on this head sure it is nevertheless that the sperm whale has no proper olfactories but what does he want of them no roses no violets no colognewater in the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
furthermore as his windpipe solely opens into the tube of his spouting canal and as that long canallike the grand erie canalis furnished with a sort of locks that open and shut for the downward retention of air or the upward exclusion of water therefore the whale has no voice unless you insult him by saying that when he so strangely rumbles he talks through his nose but then again what has the whale to say seldom have i known any profound being that had anything to say to this world unless forced to stammer out something by way of getting a living oh happy that the world is such an excellent listener ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the spouting canal of the sperm whale chiefly intended as it is for the conveyance of air and for several feet laid along horizontally just beneath the upper surface of his head and a little to one side this curious canal is very much like a gaspipe laid down in a city on one side of a street but the question returns whether this gaspipe is also a waterpipe in other words whether the spout of the sperm whale is the mere vapor of the exhaled breath or whether that exhaled breath is mixed with water taken in at the mouth and discharged through the spiracle it is certain that the mouth indirectly communicates with the spouting canal but it cannot be proved that this is for the purpose of discharging water through the spiracle because the greatest necessity for so doing would seem to be when in feeding he accidentally takes in water but the sperm whales food is far beneath the surface and there he cannot spout even if he would besides if you regard him very closely and time him with your watch you will find that when unmolested there is an undeviating rhyme between the periods of his jets and the ordinary periods of respiration ,MobyDick or The Whale
but why pester one with all this reasoning on the subject speak out you have seen him spout then declare what the spout is can you not tell water from air my dear sir in this world it is not so easy to settle these plain things i have ever found your plain things the knottiest of all and as for this whale spout you might almost stand in it and yet be undecided as to what it is precisely ,MobyDick or The Whale
the central body of it is hidden in the snowy sparkling mist enveloping it and how can you certainly tell whether any water falls from it when always when you are close enough to a whale to get a close view of his spout he is in a prodigious commotion the water cascading all around him and if at such times you should think that you really perceived drops of moisture in the spout how do you know that they are not merely condensed from its vapor or how do you know that they are not those identical drops superficially lodged in the spouthole fissure which is countersunk into the summit of the whales head for even when tranquilly swimming through the midday sea in a calm with his elevated hump sundried as a dromedarys in the desert even then the whale always carries a small basin of water on his head as under a blazing sun you will sometimes see a cavity in a rock filled up with rain ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor is it at all prudent for the hunter to be over curious touching the precise nature of the whale spout it will not do for him to be peering into it and putting his face in it you cannot go with your pitcher to this fountain and fill it and bring it away for even when coming into slight contact with the outer vapory shreds of the jet which will often happen your skin will feverishly smart from the acridness of the thing so touching it and i know one who coming into still closer contact with the spout whether with some scientific object in view or otherwise i cannot say the skin peeled off from his cheek and arm wherefore among whalemen the spout is deemed poisonous they try to evade it another thing i have heard it said and i do not much doubt it that if the jet is fairly spouted into your eyes it will blind you the wisest thing the investigator can do then it seems to me is to let this deadly spout alone ,MobyDick or The Whale
still we can hypothesize even if we cannot prove and establish my hypothesis is this that the spout is nothing but mist and besides other reasons to this conclusion i am impelled by considerations touching the great inherent dignity and sublimity of the sperm whale i account him no common shallow being inasmuch as it is an undisputed fact that he is never found on soundings or near shores all other whales sometimes are he is both ponderous and profound and i am convinced that from the heads of all ponderous profound beings such as plato pyrrho the devil jupiter dante and so on there always goes up a certain semivisible steam while in the act of thinking deep thoughts while composing a little treatise on eternity i had the curiosity to place a mirror before me and ere long saw reflected there a curious involved worming and undulation in the atmosphere over my head the invariable moisture of my hair while plunged in deep thought after six cups of hot tea in my thin shingled attic of an august noon this seems an additional argument for the above supposition ,MobyDick or The Whale
and how nobly it raises our conceit of the mighty misty monster to behold him solemnly sailing through a calm tropical sea his vast mild head overhung by a canopy of vapor engendered by his incommunicable contemplations and that vaporas you will sometimes see itglorified by a rainbow as if heaven itself had put its seal upon his thoughts for dye see rainbows do not visit the clear air they only irradiate vapor and so through all the thick mists of the dim doubts in my mind divine intuitions now and then shoot enkindling my fog with a heavenly ray and for this i thank god for all have doubts many deny but doubts or denials few along with them have intuitions doubts of all things earthly and intuitions of some things heavenly this combination makes neither believer nor infidel but makes a man who regards them both with equal eye ,MobyDick or The Whale
reckoning the largest sized sperm whales tail to begin at that point of the trunk where it tapers to about the girth of a man it comprises upon its upper surface alone an area of at least fifty square feet the compact round body of its root expands into two broad firm flat palms or flukes gradually shoaling away to less than an inch in thickness at the crotch or junction these flukes slightly overlap then sideways recede from each other like wings leaving a wide vacancy between in no living thing are the lines of beauty more exquisitely defined than in the crescentic borders of these flukes at its utmost expansion in the full grown whale the tail will considerably exceed twenty feet across ,MobyDick or The Whale
the entire member seems a dense webbed bed of welded sinews but cut into it and you find that three distinct strata compose itupper middle and lower the fibres in the upper and lower layers are long and horizontal those of the middle one very short and running crosswise between the outside layers this triune structure as much as anything else imparts power to the tail to the student of old roman walls the middle layer will furnish a curious parallel to the thin course of tiles always alternating with the stone in those wonderful relics of the antique and which undoubtedly contribute so much to the great strength of the masonry ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as if this vast local power in the tendinous tail were not enough the whole bulk of the leviathan is knit over with a warp and woof of muscular fibres and filaments which passing on either side the loins and running down into the flukes insensibly blend with them and largely contribute to their might so that in the tail the confluent measureless force of the whole whale seems concentrated to a point could annihilation occur to matter this were the thing to do it ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor does thisits amazing strength at all tend to cripple the graceful flexion of its motions where infantileness of ease undulates through a titanism of power on the contrary those motions derive their most appalling beauty from it real strength never impairs beauty or harmony but it often bestows it and in everything imposingly beautiful strength has much to do with the magic take away the tied tendons that all over seem bursting from the marble in the carved hercules and its charm would be gone as devout eckerman lifted the linen sheet from the naked corpse of goethe he was overwhelmed with the massive chest of the man that seemed as a roman triumphal arch when angelo paints even god the father in human form mark what robustness is there and whatever they may reveal of the divine love in the son the soft curled hermaphroditical italian pictures in which his idea has been most successfully embodied these pictures so destitute as they are of all brawniness hint nothing of any power but the mere negative feminine one of submission and endurance which on all hands it is conceded form the peculiar practical virtues of his teachings ,MobyDick or The Whale
such is the subtle elasticity of the organ i treat of that whether wielded in sport or in earnest or in anger whatever be the mood it be in its flexions are invariably marked by exceeding grace therein no fairys arm can transcend it ,MobyDick or The Whale
first being horizontal in its position the leviathans tail acts in a different manner from the tails of all other sea creatures it never wriggles in man or fish wriggling is a sign of inferiority to the whale his tail is the sole means of propulsion scrollwise coiled forwards beneath the body and then rapidly sprung backwards it is this which gives that singular darting leaping motion to the monster when furiously swimming his sidefins only serve to steer by ,MobyDick or The Whale
second it is a little significant that while one sperm whale only fights another sperm whale with his head and jaw nevertheless in his conflicts with man he chiefly and contemptuously uses his tail in striking at a boat he swiftly curves away his flukes from it and the blow is only inflicted by the recoil if it be made in the unobstructed air especially if it descend to its mark the stroke is then simply irresistible no ribs of man or boat can withstand it your only salvation lies in eluding it but if it comes sideways through the opposing water then partly owing to the light buoyancy of the whaleboat and the elasticity of its materials a cracked rib or a dashed plank or two a sort of stitch in the side is generally the most serious result these submerged side blows are so often received in the fishery that they are accounted mere childs play some one strips off a frock and the hole is stopped ,MobyDick or The Whale
third i cannot demonstrate it but it seems to me that in the whale the sense of touch is concentrated in the tail for in this respect there is a delicacy in it only equalled by the daintiness of the elephants trunk this delicacy is chiefly evinced in the action of sweeping when in maidenly gentleness the whale with a certain soft slowness moves his immense flukes from side to side upon the surface of the sea and if he feel but a sailors whisker woe to that sailor whiskers and all what tenderness there is in that preliminary touch had this tail any prehensile power i should straightway bethink me of darmonodes elephant that so frequented the flowermarket and with low salutations presented nosegays to damsels and then caressed their zones on more accounts than one a pity it is that the whale does not possess this prehensile virtue in his tail for i have heard of yet another elephant that when wounded in the fight curved round his trunk and extracted the dart ,MobyDick or The Whale
fourth stealing unawares upon the whale in the fancied security of the middle of solitary seas you find him unbent from the vast corpulence of his dignity and kittenlike he plays on the ocean as if it were a hearth but still you see his power in his play the broad palms of his tail are flirted high into the air then smiting the surface the thunderous concussion resounds for miles you would almost think a great gun had been discharged and if you noticed the light wreath of vapor from the spiracle at his other extremity you would think that that was the smoke from the touchhole ,MobyDick or The Whale
fifth as in the ordinary floating posture of the leviathan the flukes lie considerably below the level of his back they are then completely out of sight beneath the surface but when he is about to plunge into the deeps his entire flukes with at least thirty feet of his body are tossed erect in the air and so remain vibrating a moment till they downwards shoot out of view excepting the sublime breachsomewhere else to be describedthis peaking of the whales flukes is perhaps the grandest sight to be seen in all animated nature out of the bottomless profundities the gigantic tail seems spasmodically snatching at the highest heaven so in dreams have i seen majestic satan thrusting forth his tormented colossal claw from the flame baltic of hell but in gazing at such scenes it is all in all what mood you are in if in the dantean the devils will occur to you if in that of isaiah the archangels standing at the masthead of my ship during a sunrise that crimsoned sky and sea i once saw a large herd of whales in the east all heading towards the sun and for a moment vibrating in concert with peaked flukes as it seemed to me at the time such a grand embodiment of adoration of the gods was never beheld even in persia the home of the fire worshippers as ptolemy philopater testified of the african elephant i then testified of the whale pronouncing him the most devout of all beings for according to king juba the military elephants of antiquity often hailed the morning with their trunks uplifted in the profoundest silence ,MobyDick or The Whale
the chance comparison in this chapter between the whale and the elephant so far as some aspects of the tail of the one and the trunk of the other are concerned should not tend to place those two opposite organs on an equality much less the creatures to which they respectively belong for as the mightiest elephant is but a terrier to leviathan so compared with leviathans tail his trunk is but the stalk of a lily the most direful blow from the elephants trunk were as the playful tap of a fan compared with the measureless crush and crash of the sperm whales ponderous flukes which in repeated instances have one after the other hurled entire boats with all their oars and crews into the air very much as an indian juggler tosses his balls ,MobyDick or The Whale
though all comparison in the way of general bulk between the whale and the elephant is preposterous inasmuch as in that particular the elephant stands in much the same respect to the whale that a dog does to the elephant nevertheless there are not wanting some points of curious similitude among these is the spout it is well known that the elephant will often draw up water or dust in his trunk and then elevating it jet it forth in a stream ,MobyDick or The Whale
the more i consider this mighty tail the more do i deplore my inability to express it at times there are gestures in it which though they would well grace the hand of man remain wholly inexplicable in an extensive herd so remarkable occasionally are these mystic gestures that i have heard hunters who have declared them akin to freemason signs and symbols that the whale indeed by these methods intelligently conversed with the world nor are there wanting other motions of the whale in his general body full of strangeness and unaccountable to his most experienced assailant dissect him how i may then i but go skin deep i know him not and never will but if i know not even the tail of this whale how understand his head much more how comprehend his face when face he has none thou shalt see my back parts my tail he seems to say but my face shall not be seen but i cannot completely make out his back parts and hint what he will about his face i say again he has no face ,MobyDick or The Whale
the long and narrow peninsula of malacca extending southeastward from the territories of birmah forms the most southerly point of all asia in a continuous line from that peninsula stretch the long islands of sumatra java bally and timor which with many others form a vast mole or rampart lengthwise connecting asia with australia and dividing the long unbroken indian ocean from the thickly studded oriental archipelagoes this rampart is pierced by several sallyports for the convenience of ships and whales conspicuous among which are the straits of sunda and malacca by the straits of sunda chiefly vessels bound to china from the west emerge into the china seas ,MobyDick or The Whale
those narrow straits of sunda divide sumatra from java and standing midway in that vast rampart of islands buttressed by that bold green promontory known to seamen as java head they not a little correspond to the central gateway opening into some vast walled empire and considering the inexhaustible wealth of spices and silks and jewels and gold and ivory with which the thousand islands of that oriental sea are enriched it seems a significant provision of nature that such treasures by the very formation of the land should at least bear the appearance however ineffectual of being guarded from the allgrasping western world the shores of the straits of sunda are unsupplied with those domineering fortresses which guard the entrances to the mediterranean the baltic and the propontis unlike the danes these orientals do not demand the obsequious homage of lowered topsails from the endless procession of ships before the wind which for centuries past by night and by day have passed between the islands of sumatra and java freighted with the costliest cargoes of the east but while they freely waive a ceremonial like this they do by no means renounce their claim to more solid tribute ,MobyDick or The Whale
time out of mind the piratical proas of the malays lurking among the low shaded coves and islets of sumatra have sallied out upon the vessels sailing through the straits fiercely demanding tribute at the point of their spears though by the repeated bloody chastisements they have received at the hands of european cruisers the audacity of these corsairs has of late been somewhat repressed yet even at the present day we occasionally hear of english and american vessels which in those waters have been remorselessly boarded and pillaged ,MobyDick or The Whale
with a fair fresh wind the pequod was now drawing nigh to these straits ahab purposing to pass through them into the javan sea and thence cruising northwards over waters known to be frequented here and there by the sperm whale sweep inshore by the philippine islands and gain the far coast of japan in time for the great whaling season there by these means the circumnavigating pequod would sweep almost all the known sperm whale cruising grounds of the world previous to descending upon the line in the pacific where ahab though everywhere else foiled in his pursuit firmly counted upon giving battle to moby dick in the sea he was most known to frequent and at a season when he might most reasonably be presumed to be haunting it ,MobyDick or The Whale
but how now in this zoned quest does ahab touch no land does his crew drink air surely he will stop for water nay for a long time now the circusrunning sun has raced within his fiery ring and needs no sustenance but whats in himself so ahab mark this too in the whaler while other hulls are loaded down with alien stuff to be transferred to foreign wharves the worldwandering whaleship carries no cargo but herself and crew their weapons and their wants she has a whole lakes contents bottled in her ample hold she is ballasted with utilities not altogether with unusable piglead and kentledge she carries years water in her clear old prime nantucket water which when three years afloat the nantucketer in the pacific prefers to drink before the brackish fluid but yesterday rafted off in casks from the peruvian or indian streams hence it is that while other ships may have gone to china from new york and back again touching at a score of ports the whaleship in all that interval may not have sighted one grain of soil her crew having seen no man but floating seamen like themselves so that did you carry them the news that another flood had come they would only answerwell boys heres the ark ,MobyDick or The Whale
now as many sperm whales had been captured off the western coast of java in the near vicinity of the straits of sunda indeed as most of the ground roundabout was generally recognised by the fishermen as an excellent spot for cruising therefore as the pequod gained more and more upon java head the lookouts were repeatedly hailed and admonished to keep wide awake but though the green palmy cliffs of the land soon loomed on the starboard bow and with delighted nostrils the fresh cinnamon was snuffed in the air yet not a single jet was descried almost renouncing all thought of falling in with any game hereabouts the ship had well nigh entered the straits when the customary cheering cry was heard from aloft and ere long a spectacle of singular magnificence saluted us ,MobyDick or The Whale
but here be it premised that owing to the unwearied activity with which of late they have been hunted over all four oceans the sperm whales instead of almost invariably sailing in small detached companies as in former times are now frequently met with in extensive herds sometimes embracing so great a multitude that it would almost seem as if numerous nations of them had sworn solemn league and covenant for mutual assistance and protection to this aggregation of the sperm whale into such immense caravans may be imputed the circumstance that even in the best cruising grounds you may now sometimes sail for weeks and months together without being greeted by a single spout and then be suddenly saluted by what sometimes seems thousands on thousands ,MobyDick or The Whale
broad on both bows at the distance of some two or three miles and forming a great semicircle embracing one half of the level horizon a continuous chain of whalejets were upplaying and sparkling in the noonday air unlike the straight perpendicular twinjets of the right whale which dividing at top fall over in two branches like the cleft drooping boughs of a willow the single forwardslanting spout of the sperm whale presents a thick curled bush of white mist continually rising and falling away to leeward ,MobyDick or The Whale
seen from the pequods deck then as she would rise on a high hill of the sea this host of vapory spouts individually curling up into the air and beheld through a blending atmosphere of bluish haze showed like the thousand cheerful chimneys of some dense metropolis descried of a balmy autumnal morning by some horseman on a height ,MobyDick or The Whale
as marching armies approaching an unfriendly defile in the mountains accelerate their march all eagerness to place that perilous passage in their rear and once more expand in comparative security upon the plain even so did this vast fleet of whales now seem hurrying forward through the straits gradually contracting the wings of their semicircle and swimming on in one solid but still crescentic centre ,MobyDick or The Whale
crowding all sail the pequod pressed after them the harpooneers handling their weapons and loudly cheering from the heads of their yet suspended boats if the wind only held little doubt had they that chased through these straits of sunda the vast host would only deploy into the oriental seas to witness the capture of not a few of their number and who could tell whether in that congregated caravan moby dick himself might not temporarily be swimming like the worshipped whiteelephant in the coronation procession of the siamese so with stunsail piled on stunsail we sailed along driving these leviathans before us when of a sudden the voice of tashtego was heard loudly directing attention to something in our wake ,MobyDick or The Whale
corresponding to the crescent in our van we beheld another in our rear it seemed formed of detached white vapors rising and falling something like the spouts of the whales only they did not so completely come and go for they constantly hovered without finally disappearing levelling his glass at this sight ahab quickly revolved in his pivothole crying aloft there and rig whips and buckets to wet the sailsmalays sir and after us ,MobyDick or The Whale
as if too long lurking behind the headlands till the pequod should fairly have entered the straits these rascally asiatics were now in hot pursuit to make up for their overcautious delay but when the swift pequod with a fresh leading wind was herself in hot chase how very kind of these tawny philanthropists to assist in speeding her on to her own chosen pursuitmere ridingwhips and rowels to her that they were as with glass under arm ahab toandfro paced the deck in his forward turn beholding the monsters he chased and in the after one the bloodthirsty pirates chasing him some such fancy as the above seemed his and when he glanced upon the green walls of the watery defile in which the ship was then sailing and bethought him that through that gate lay the route to his vengeance and beheld how that through that same gate he was now both chasing and being chased to his deadly end and not only that but a herd of remorseless wild pirates and inhuman atheistical devils were infernally cheering him on with their curseswhen all these conceits had passed through his brain ahabs brow was left gaunt and ribbed like the black sand beach after some stormy tide has been gnawing it without being able to drag the firm thing from its place ,MobyDick or The Whale
but thoughts like these troubled very few of the reckless crew and when after steadily dropping and dropping the pirates astern the pequod at last shot by the vivid green cockatoo point on the sumatra side emerging at last upon the broad waters beyond then the harpooneers seemed more to grieve that the swift whales had been gaining upon the ship than to rejoice that the ship had so victoriously gained upon the malays but still driving on in the wake of the whales at length they seemed abating their speed gradually the ship neared them and the wind now dying away word was passed to spring to the boats but no sooner did the herd by some presumed wonderful instinct of the sperm whale become notified of the three keels that were after themthough as yet a mile in their rearthan they rallied again and forming in close ranks and battalions so that their spouts all looked like flashing lines of stacked bayonets moved on with redoubled velocity ,MobyDick or The Whale
stripped to our shirts and drawers we sprang to the whiteash and after several hours pulling were almost disposed to renounce the chase when a general pausing commotion among the whales gave animating token that they were now at last under the influence of that strange perplexity of inert irresolution which when the fishermen perceive it in the whale they say he is gallied the compact martial columns in which they had been hitherto rapidly and steadily swimming were now broken up in one measureless rout and like king porus elephants in the indian battle with alexander they seemed going mad with consternation in all directions expanding in vast irregular circles and aimlessly swimming hither and thither by their short thick spoutings they plainly betrayed their distraction of panic this was still more strangely evinced by those of their number who completely paralysed as it were helplessly floated like waterlogged dismantled ships on the sea had these leviathans been but a flock of simple sheep pursued over the pasture by three fierce wolves they could not possibly have evinced such excessive dismay but this occasional timidity is characteristic of almost all herding creatures though banding together in tens of thousands the lionmaned buffaloes of the west have fled before a solitary horseman witness too all human beings how when herded together in the sheepfold of a theatres pit they will at the slightest alarm of fire rush helterskelter for the outlets crowding trampling jamming and remorselessly dashing each other to death best therefore withhold any amazement at the strangely gallied whales before us for there is no folly of the beasts of the earth which is not infinitely outdone by the madness of men ,MobyDick or The Whale
though many of the whales as has been said were in violent motion yet it is to be observed that as a whole the herd neither advanced nor retreated but collectively remained in one place as is customary in those cases the boats at once separated each making for some one lone whale on the outskirts of the shoal in about three minutes time queequegs harpoon was flung the stricken fish darted blinding spray in our faces and then running away with us like light steered straight for the heart of the herd though such a movement on the part of the whale struck under such circumstances is in no wise unprecedented and indeed is almost always more or less anticipated yet does it present one of the more perilous vicissitudes of the fishery for as the swift monster drags you deeper and deeper into the frantic shoal you bid adieu to circumspect life and only exist in a delirious throb ,MobyDick or The Whale
as blind and deaf the whale plunged forward as if by sheer power of speed to rid himself of the iron leech that had fastened to him as we thus tore a white gash in the sea on all sides menaced as we flew by the crazed creatures to and fro rushing about us our beset boat was like a ship mobbed by iceisles in a tempest and striving to steer through their complicated channels and straits knowing not at what moment it may be locked in and crushed ,MobyDick or The Whale
but not a bit daunted queequeg steered us manfully now sheering off from this monster directly across our route in advance now edging away from that whose colossal flukes were suspended overhead while all the time starbuck stood up in the bows lance in hand pricking out of our way whatever whales he could reach by short darts for there was no time to make long ones nor were the oarsmen quite idle though their wonted duty was now altogether dispensed with they chiefly attended to the shouting part of the business out of the way commodore cried one to a great dromedary that of a sudden rose bodily to the surface and for an instant threatened to swamp us hard down with your tail there cried a second to another which close to our gunwale seemed calmly cooling himself with his own fanlike extremity ,MobyDick or The Whale
all whaleboats carry certain curious contrivances originally invented by the nantucket indians called druggs two thick squares of wood of equal size are stoutly clenched together so that they cross each others grain at right angles a line of considerable length is then attached to the middle of this block and the other end of the line being looped it can in a moment be fastened to a harpoon it is chiefly among gallied whales that this drugg is used for then more whales are close round you than you can possibly chase at one time but sperm whales are not every day encountered while you may then you must kill all you can and if you cannot kill them all at once you must wing them so that they can be afterwards killed at your leisure hence it is that at times like these the drugg comes into requisition our boat was furnished with three of them the first and second were successfully darted and we saw the whales staggeringly running off fettered by the enormous sidelong resistance of the towing drugg they were cramped like malefactors with the chain and ball but upon flinging the third in the act of tossing overboard the clumsy wooden block it caught under one of the seats of the boat and in an instant tore it out and carried it away dropping the oarsman in the boats bottom as the seat slid from under him on both sides the sea came in at the wounded planks but we stuffed two or three drawers and shirts in and so stopped the leaks for the time ,MobyDick or The Whale
it had been next to impossible to dart these druggedharpoons were it not that as we advanced into the herd our whales way greatly diminished moreover that as we went still further and further from the circumference of commotion the direful disorders seemed waning so that when at last the jerking harpoon drew out and the towing whale sideways vanished then with the tapering force of his parting momentum we glided between two whales into the innermost heart of the shoal as if from some mountain torrent we had slid into a serene valley lake here the storms in the roaring glens between the outermost whales were heard but not felt in this central expanse the sea presented that smooth satinlike surface called a sleek produced by the subtle moisture thrown off by the whale in his more quiet moods yes we were now in that enchanted calm which they say lurks at the heart of every commotion and still in the distracted distance we beheld the tumults of the outer concentric circles and saw successive pods of whales eight or ten in each swiftly going round and round like multiplied spans of horses in a ring and so closely shoulder to shoulder that a titanic circusrider might easily have overarched the middle ones and so have gone round on their backs owing to the density of the crowd of reposing whales more immediately surrounding the embayed axis of the herd no possible chance of escape was at present afforded us we must watch for a breach in the living wall that hemmed us in the wall that had only admitted us in order to shut us up keeping at the centre of the lake we were occasionally visited by small tame cows and calves the women and children of this routed host ,MobyDick or The Whale
now inclusive of the occasional wide intervals between the revolving outer circles and inclusive of the spaces between the various pods in any one of those circles the entire area at this juncture embraced by the whole multitude must have contained at least two or three square miles at any ratethough indeed such a test at such a time might be deceptivespoutings might be discovered from our low boat that seemed playing up almost from the rim of the horizon i mention this circumstance because as if the cows and calves had been purposely locked up in this innermost fold and as if the wide extent of the herd had hitherto prevented them from learning the precise cause of its stopping or possibly being so young unsophisticated and every way innocent and inexperienced however it may have been these smaller whalesnow and then visiting our becalmed boat from the margin of the lakeevinced a wondrous fearlessness and confidence or else a still becharmed panic which it was impossible not to marvel at like household dogs they came snuffling round us right up to our gunwales and touching them till it almost seemed that some spell had suddenly domesticated them queequeg patted their foreheads starbuck scratched their backs with his lance but fearful of the consequences for the time refrained from darting it ,MobyDick or The Whale
but far beneath this wondrous world upon the surface another and still stranger world met our eyes as we gazed over the side for suspended in those watery vaults floated the forms of the nursing mothers of the whales and those that by their enormous girth seemed shortly to become mothers the lake as i have hinted was to a considerable depth exceedingly transparent and as human infants while suckling will calmly and fixedly gaze away from the breast as if leading two different lives at the time and while yet drawing mortal nourishment be still spiritually feasting upon some unearthly reminiscenceeven so did the young of these whales seem looking up towards us but not at us as if we were but a bit of gulfweed in their newborn sight floating on their sides the mothers also seemed quietly eyeing us one of these little infants that from certain queer tokens seemed hardly a day old might have measured some fourteen feet in length and some six feet in girth he was a little frisky though as yet his body seemed scarce yet recovered from that irksome position it had so lately occupied in the maternal reticule where tail to head and all ready for the final spring the unborn whale lies bent like a tartars bow the delicate sidefins and the palms of his flukes still freshly retained the plaited crumpled appearance of a babys ears newly arrived from foreign parts ,MobyDick or The Whale
as when the stricken whale that from the tub has reeled out hundreds of fathoms of rope as after deep sounding he floats up again and shows the slackened curling line buoyantly rising and spiralling towards the air so now starbuck saw long coils of the umbilical cord of madame leviathan by which the young cub seemed still tethered to its dam not seldom in the rapid vicissitudes of the chase this natural line with the maternal end loose becomes entangled with the hempen one so that the cub is thereby trapped some of the subtlest secrets of the seas seemed divulged to us in this enchanted pond we saw young leviathan amours in the deep ,MobyDick or The Whale
the sperm whale as with all other species of the leviathan but unlike most other fish breeds indifferently at all seasons after a gestation which may probably be set down at nine months producing but one at a time though in some few known instances giving birth to an esau and jacoba contingency provided for in suckling by two teats curiously situated one on each side of the anus but the breasts themselves extend upwards from that when by chance these precious parts in a nursing whale are cut by the hunters lance the mothers pouring milk and blood rivallingly discolour the sea for rods the milk is very sweet and rich it has been tasted by man it might do well with strawberries when overflowing with mutual esteem the whales salute more hominum ,MobyDick or The Whale
and thus though surrounded by circle upon circle of consternations and affrights did these inscrutable creatures at the centre freely and fearlessly indulge in all peaceful concernments yea serenely revelled in dalliance and delight but even so amid the tornadoed atlantic of my being do i myself still for ever centrally disport in mute calm and while ponderous planets of unwaning woe revolve round me deep down and deep inland there i still bathe me in eternal mildness of joy ,MobyDick or The Whale
meanwhile as we thus lay entranced the occasional sudden frantic spectacles in the distance evinced the activity of the other boats still engaged in drugging the whales on the frontier of the host or possibly carrying on the war within the first circle where abundance of room and some convenient retreats were afforded them but the sight of the enraged drugged whales now and then blindly darting to and fro across the circles was nothing to what at last met our eyes it is sometimes the custom when fast to a whale more than commonly powerful and alert to seek to hamstring him as it were by sundering or maiming his gigantic tailtendon it is done by darting a shorthandled cuttingspade to which is attached a rope for hauling it back again a whale wounded as we afterwards learned in this part but not effectually as it seemed had broken away from the boat carrying along with him half of the harpoon line and in the extraordinary agony of the wound he was now dashing among the revolving circles like the lone mounted desperado arnold at the battle of saratoga carrying dismay wherever he went ,MobyDick or The Whale
but agonizing as was the wound of this whale and an appalling spectacle enough any way yet the peculiar horror with which he seemed to inspire the rest of the herd was owing to a cause which at first the intervening distance obscured from us but at length we perceived that by one of the unimaginable accidents of the fishery this whale had become entangled in the harpoonline that he towed he had also run away with the cuttingspade in him and while the free end of the rope attached to that weapon had permanently caught in the coils of the harpoonline round his tail the cuttingspade itself had worked loose from his flesh so that tormented to madness he was now churning through the water violently flailing with his flexible tail and tossing the keen spade about him wounding and murdering his own comrades ,MobyDick or The Whale
this terrific object seemed to recall the whole herd from their stationary fright first the whales forming the margin of our lake began to crowd a little and tumble against each other as if lifted by half spent billows from afar then the lake itself began faintly to heave and swell the submarine bridalchambers and nurseries vanished in more and more contracting orbits the whales in the more central circles began to swim in thickening clusters yes the long calm was departing a low advancing hum was soon heard and then like to the tumultuous masses of blockice when the great river hudson breaks up in spring the entire host of whales came tumbling upon their inner centre as if to pile themselves up in one common mountain instantly starbuck and queequeg changed places starbuck taking the stern ,MobyDick or The Whale
oars oars he intensely whispered seizing the helmgripe your oars and clutch your souls now my god men stand by shove him off you queequegthe whale thereprick himhit him stand upstand up and stay so spring menpull men never mind their backsscrape themscrape away ,MobyDick or The Whale
the boat was now all but jammed between two vast black bulks leaving a narrow dardanelles between their long lengths but by desperate endeavor we at last shot into a temporary opening then giving way rapidly and at the same time earnestly watching for another outlet after many similar hairbreadth escapes we at last swiftly glided into what had just been one of the outer circles but now crossed by random whales all violently making for one centre this lucky salvation was cheaply purchased by the loss of queequegs hat who while standing in the bows to prick the fugitive whales had his hat taken clean from his head by the aireddy made by the sudden tossing of a pair of broad flukes close by ,MobyDick or The Whale
riotous and disordered as the universal commotion now was it soon resolved itself into what seemed a systematic movement for having clumped together at last in one dense body they then renewed their onward flight with augmented fleetness further pursuit was useless but the boats still lingered in their wake to pick up what drugged whales might be dropped astern and likewise to secure one which flask had killed and waifed the waif is a pennoned pole two or three of which are carried by every boat and which when additional game is at hand are inserted upright into the floating body of a dead whale both to mark its place on the sea and also as token of prior possession should the boats of any other ship draw near ,MobyDick or The Whale
the result of this lowering was somewhat illustrative of that sagacious saying in the fisherythe more whales the less fish of all the drugged whales only one was captured the rest contrived to escape for the time but only to be taken as will hereafter be seen by some other craft than the pequod ,MobyDick or The Whale
now though such great bodies are at times encountered yet as must have been seen even at the present day small detached bands are occasionally observed embracing from twenty to fifty individuals each such bands are known as schools they generally are of two sorts those composed almost entirely of females and those mustering none but young vigorous males or bulls as they are familiarly designated ,MobyDick or The Whale
in cavalier attendance upon the school of females you invariably see a male of full grown magnitude but not old who upon any alarm evinces his gallantry by falling in the rear and covering the flight of his ladies in truth this gentleman is a luxurious ottoman swimming about over the watery world surroundingly accompanied by all the solaces and endearments of the harem the contrast between this ottoman and his concubines is striking because while he is always of the largest leviathanic proportions the ladies even at full growth are not more than onethird of the bulk of an averagesized male they are comparatively delicate indeed i dare say not to exceed half a dozen yards round the waist nevertheless it cannot be denied that upon the whole they are hereditarily entitled to en bon point ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is very curious to watch this harem and its lord in their indolent ramblings like fashionables they are for ever on the move in leisurely search of variety you meet them on the line in time for the full flower of the equatorial feeding season having just returned perhaps from spending the summer in the northern seas and so cheating summer of all unpleasant weariness and warmth by the time they have lounged up and down the promenade of the equator awhile they start for the oriental waters in anticipation of the cool season there and so evade the other excessive temperature of the year ,MobyDick or The Whale
when serenely advancing on one of these journeys if any strange suspicious sights are seen my lord whale keeps a wary eye on his interesting family should any unwarrantably pert young leviathan coming that way presume to draw confidentially close to one of the ladies with what prodigious fury the bashaw assails him and chases him away high times indeed if unprincipled young rakes like him are to be permitted to invade the sanctity of domestic bliss though do what the bashaw will he cannot keep the most notorious lothario out of his bed for alas all fish bed in common as ashore the ladies often cause the most terrible duels among their rival admirers just so with the whales who sometimes come to deadly battle and all for love they fence with their long lower jaws sometimes locking them together and so striving for the supremacy like elks that warringly interweave their antlers not a few are captured having the deep scars of these encountersfurrowed heads broken teeth scolloped fins and in some instances wrenched and dislocated mouths ,MobyDick or The Whale
but supposing the invader of domestic bliss to betake himself away at the first rush of the harems lord then is it very diverting to watch that lord gently he insinuates his vast bulk among them again and revels there awhile still in tantalizing vicinity to young lothario like pious solomon devoutly worshipping among his thousand concubines granting other whales to be in sight the fishermen will seldom give chase to one of these grand turks for these grand turks are too lavish of their strength and hence their unctuousness is small as for the sons and the daughters they beget why those sons and daughters must take care of themselves at least with only the maternal help for like certain other omnivorous roving lovers that might be named my lord whale has no taste for the nursery however much for the bower and so being a great traveller he leaves his anonymous babies all over the world every baby an exotic in good time nevertheless as the ardour of youth declines as years and dumps increase as reflection lends her solemn pauses in short as a general lassitude overtakes the sated turk then a love of ease and virtue supplants the love for maidens our ottoman enters upon the impotent repentant admonitory stage of life forswears disbands the harem and grown to an exemplary sulky old soul goes about all alone among the meridians and parallels saying his prayers and warning each young leviathan from his amorous errors ,MobyDick or The Whale
now as the harem of whales is called by the fishermen a school so is the lord and master of that school technically known as the schoolmaster it is therefore not in strict character however admirably satirical that after going to school himself he should then go abroad inculcating not what he learned there but the folly of it his title schoolmaster would very naturally seem derived from the name bestowed upon the harem itself but some have surmised that the man who first thus entitled this sort of ottoman whale must have read the memoirs of vidocq and informed himself what sort of a countryschoolmaster that famous frenchman was in his younger days and what was the nature of those occult lessons he inculcated into some of his pupils ,MobyDick or The Whale
the same secludedness and isolation to which the schoolmaster whale betakes himself in his advancing years is true of all aged sperm whales almost universally a lone whaleas a solitary leviathan is calledproves an ancient one like venerable mossbearded daniel boone he will have no one near him but nature herself and her he takes to wife in the wilderness of waters and the best of wives she is though she keeps so many moody secrets ,MobyDick or The Whale
the schools composing none but young and vigorous males previously mentioned offer a strong contrast to the harem schools for while those female whales are characteristically timid the young males or fortybarrelbulls as they call them are by far the most pugnacious of all leviathans and proverbially the most dangerous to encounter excepting those wondrous greyheaded grizzled whales sometimes met and these will fight you like grim fiends exasperated by a penal gout ,MobyDick or The Whale
the fortybarrelbull schools are larger than the harem schools like a mob of young collegians they are full of fight fun and wickedness tumbling round the world at such a reckless rollicking rate that no prudent underwriter would insure them any more than he would a riotous lad at yale or harvard they soon relinquish this turbulence though and when about threefourths grown break up and separately go about in quest of settlements that is harems ,MobyDick or The Whale
another point of difference between the male and female schools is still more characteristic of the sexes say you strike a fortybarrelbullpoor devil all his comrades quit him but strike a member of the harem school and her companions swim around her with every token of concern sometimes lingering so near her and so long as themselves to fall a prey ,MobyDick or The Whale
it frequently happens that when several ships are cruising in company a whale may be struck by one vessel then escape and be finally killed and captured by another vessel and herein are indirectly comprised many minor contingencies all partaking of this one grand feature for exampleafter a weary and perilous chase and capture of a whale the body may get loose from the ship by reason of a violent storm and drifting far away to leeward be retaken by a second whaler who in a calm snugly tows it alongside without risk of life or line thus the most vexatious and violent disputes would often arise between the fishermen were there not some written or unwritten universal undisputed law applicable to all cases ,MobyDick or The Whale
perhaps the only formal whaling code authorized by legislative enactment was that of holland it was decreed by the statesgeneral in ad  but though no other nation has ever had any written whaling law yet the american fishermen have been their own legislators and lawyers in this matter they have provided a system which for terse comprehensiveness surpasses justinians pandects and the bylaws of the chinese society for the suppression of meddling with other peoples business yes these laws might be engraven on a queen annes farthing or the barb of a harpoon and worn round the neck so small are they ,MobyDick or The Whale
first what is a fastfish alive or dead a fish is technically fast when it is connected with an occupied ship or boat by any medium at all controllable by the occupant or occupantsa mast an oar a nineinch cable a telegraph wire or a strand of cobweb it is all the same likewise a fish is technically fast when it bears a waif or any other recognised symbol of possession so long as the party waifing it plainly evince their ability at any time to take it alongside as well as their intention so to do ,MobyDick or The Whale
these are scientific commentaries but the commentaries of the whalemen themselves sometimes consist in hard words and harder knocksthe cokeuponlittleton of the fist true among the more upright and honorable whalemen allowances are always made for peculiar cases where it would be an outrageous moral injustice for one party to claim possession of a whale previously chased or killed by another party but others are by no means so scrupulous ,MobyDick or The Whale
some fifty years ago there was a curious case of whaletrover litigated in england wherein the plaintiffs set forth that after a hard chase of a whale in the northern seas and when indeed they the plaintiffs had succeeded in harpooning the fish they were at last through peril of their lives obliged to forsake not only their lines but their boat itself ultimately the defendants the crew of another ship came up with the whale struck killed seized and finally appropriated it before the very eyes of the plaintiffs and when those defendants were remonstrated with their captain snapped his fingers in the plaintiffs teeth and assured them that by way of doxology to the deed he had done he would now retain their line harpoons and boat which had remained attached to the whale at the time of the seizure wherefore the plaintiffs now sued for the recovery of the value of their whale line harpoons and boat ,MobyDick or The Whale
mr erskine was counsel for the defendants lord ellenborough was the judge in the course of the defence the witty erskine went on to illustrate his position by alluding to a recent crim con case wherein a gentleman after in vain trying to bridle his wifes viciousness had at last abandoned her upon the seas of life but in the course of years repenting of that step he instituted an action to recover possession of her erskine was on the other side and he then supported it by saying that though the gentleman had originally harpooned the lady and had once had her fast and only by reason of the great stress of her plunging viciousness had at last abandoned her yet abandon her he did so that she became a loosefish and therefore when a subsequent gentleman reharpooned her the lady then became that subsequent gentlemans property along with whatever harpoon might have been found sticking in her ,MobyDick or The Whale
these pleadings and the counter pleadings being duly heard the very learned judge in set terms decided to witthat as for the boat he awarded it to the plaintiffs because they had merely abandoned it to save their lives but that with regard to the controverted whale harpoons and line they belonged to the defendants the whale because it was a loosefish at the time of the final capture and the harpoons and line because when the fish made off with them it the fish acquired a property in those articles and hence anybody who afterwards took the fish had a right to them now the defendants afterwards took the fish ergo the aforesaid articles were theirs ,MobyDick or The Whale
a common man looking at this decision of the very learned judge might possibly object to it but ploughed up to the primary rock of the matter the two great principles laid down in the twin whaling laws previously quoted and applied and elucidated by lord ellenborough in the above cited case these two laws touching fastfish and loosefish i say will on reflection be found the fundamentals of all human jurisprudence for notwithstanding its complicated tracery of sculpture the temple of the law like the temple of the philistines has but two props to stand on ,MobyDick or The Whale
is it not a saying in every ones mouth possession is half of the law that is regardless of how the thing came into possession but often possession is the whole of the law what are the sinews and souls of russian serfs and republican slaves but fastfish whereof possession is the whole of the law what to the rapacious landlord is the widows last mite but a fastfish what is yonder undetected villains marble mansion with a doorplate for a waif what is that but a fastfish what is the ruinous discount which mordecai the broker gets from poor woebegone the bankrupt on a loan to keep woebegones family from starvation what is that ruinous discount but a fastfish what is the archbishop of savesouls income of  seized from the scant bread and cheese of hundreds of thousands of brokenbacked laborers all sure of heaven without any of savesouls help what is that globular  but a fastfish what are the duke of dunders hereditary towns and hamlets but fastfish what to that redoubted harpooneer john bull is poor ireland but a fastfish what to that apostolic lancer brother jonathan is texas but a fastfish and concerning all these is not possession the whole of the law ,MobyDick or The Whale
what was america in  but a loosefish in which columbus struck the spanish standard by way of waifing it for his royal master and mistress what was poland to the czar what greece to the turk what india to england what at last will mexico be to the united states all loosefish ,MobyDick or The Whale

latin from the books of the laws of england which taken along with the context means that of all whales captured by anybody on the coast of that land the king as honorary grand harpooneer must have the head and the queen be respectfully presented with the tail a division which in the whale is much like halving an apple there is no intermediate remainder now as this law under a modified form is to this day in force in england and as it offers in various respects a strange anomaly touching the general law of fast and loosefish it is here treated of in a separate chapter on the same courteous principle that prompts the english railways to be at the expense of a separate car specially reserved for the accommodation of royalty in the first place in curious proof of the fact that the abovementioned law is still in force i proceed to lay before you a circumstance that happened within the last two years ,MobyDick or The Whale
it seems that some honest mariners of dover or sandwich or some one of the cinque ports had after a hard chase succeeded in killing and beaching a fine whale which they had originally descried afar off from the shore now the cinque ports are partially or somehow under the jurisdiction of a sort of policeman or beadle called a lord warden holding the office directly from the crown i believe all the royal emoluments incident to the cinque port territories become by assignment his by some writers this office is called a sinecure but not so because the lord warden is busily employed at times in fobbing his perquisites which are his chiefly by virtue of that same fobbing of them ,MobyDick or The Whale
now when these poor sunburnt mariners barefooted and with their trowsers rolled high up on their eely legs had wearily hauled their fat fish high and dry promising themselves a good  from the precious oil and bone and in fantasy sipping rare tea with their wives and good ale with their cronies upon the strength of their respective shares up steps a very learned and most christian and charitable gentleman with a copy of blackstone under his arm and laying it upon the whales head he sayshands off this fish my masters is a fastfish i seize it as the lord wardens upon this the poor mariners in their respectful consternationso truly englishknowing not what to say fall to vigorously scratching their heads all round meanwhile ruefully glancing from the whale to the stranger but that did in nowise mend the matter or at all soften the hard heart of the learned gentleman with the copy of blackstone at length one of them after long scratching about for his ideas made bold to speak ,MobyDick or The Whale
in a word the whale was seized and sold and his grace the duke of wellington received the money thinking that viewed in some particular lights the case might by a bare possibility in some small degree be deemed under the circumstances a rather hard one an honest clergyman of the town respectfully addressed a note to his grace begging him to take the case of those unfortunate mariners into full consideration to which my lord duke in substance replied both letters were published that he had already done so and received the money and would be obliged to the reverend gentleman if for the future he the reverend gentleman would decline meddling with other peoples business is this the still militant old man standing at the corners of the three kingdoms on all hands coercing alms of beggars ,MobyDick or The Whale
it will readily be seen that in this case the alleged right of the duke to the whale was a delegated one from the sovereign we must needs inquire then on what principle the sovereign is originally invested with that right the law itself has already been set forth but plowdon gives us the reason for it says plowdon the whale so caught belongs to the king and queen because of its superior excellence and by the soundest commentators this has ever been held a cogent argument in such matters ,MobyDick or The Whale
in his treatise on queengold or queenpinmoney an old kings bench author one william prynne thus discourseth ye tail is ye queens that ye queens wardrobe may be supplied with ye whalebone now this was written at a time when the black limber bone of the greenland or right whale was largely used in ladies bodices but this same bone is not in the tail it is in the head which is a sad mistake for a sagacious lawyer like prynne but is the queen a mermaid to be presented with a tail an allegorical meaning may lurk here ,MobyDick or The Whale
there are two royal fish so styled by the english law writersthe whale and the sturgeon both royal property under certain limitations and nominally supplying the tenth branch of the crowns ordinary revenue i know not that any other author has hinted of the matter but by inference it seems to me that the sturgeon must be divided in the same way as the whale the king receiving the highly dense and elastic head peculiar to that fish which symbolically regarded may possibly be humorously grounded upon some presumed congeniality and thus there seems a reason in all things even in law ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a week or two after the last whaling scene recounted and when we were slowly sailing over a sleepy vapory midday sea that the many noses on the pequods deck proved more vigilant discoverers than the three pairs of eyes aloft a peculiar and not very pleasant smell was smelt in the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
presently the vapors in advance slid aside and there in the distance lay a ship whose furled sails betokened that some sort of whale must be alongside as we glided nearer the stranger showed french colours from his peak and by the eddying cloud of vulture seafowl that circled and hovered and swooped around him it was plain that the whale alongside must be what the fishermen call a blasted whale that is a whale that has died unmolested on the sea and so floated an unappropriated corpse it may well be conceived what an unsavory odor such a mass must exhale worse than an assyrian city in the plague when the living are incompetent to bury the departed so intolerable indeed is it regarded by some that no cupidity could persuade them to moor alongside of it yet are there those who will still do it notwithstanding the fact that the oil obtained from such subjects is of a very inferior quality and by no means of the nature of attarofrose ,MobyDick or The Whale
coming still nearer with the expiring breeze we saw that the frenchman had a second whale alongside and this second whale seemed even more of a nosegay than the first in truth it turned out to be one of those problematical whales that seem to dry up and die with a sort of prodigious dyspepsia or indigestion leaving their defunct bodies almost entirely bankrupt of anything like oil nevertheless in the proper place we shall see that no knowing fisherman will ever turn up his nose at such a whale as this however much he may shun blasted whales in general ,MobyDick or The Whale
theres a pretty fellow now he banteringly laughed standing in the ships bows theres a jackal for ye i well know that these crappoes of frenchmen are but poor devils in the fishery sometimes lowering their boats for breakers mistaking them for sperm whale spouts yes and sometimes sailing from their port with their hold full of boxes of tallow candles and cases of snuffers foreseeing that all the oil they will get wont be enough to dip the captains wick into aye we all know these things but look ye heres a crappo that is content with our leavings the drugged whale there i mean aye and is content too with scraping the dry bones of that other precious fish he has there poor devil i say pass round a hat some one and lets make him a present of a little oil for dear charitys sake for what oil hell get from that drugged whale there wouldnt be fit to burn in a jail no not in a condemned cell and as for the other whale why ill agree to get more oil by chopping up and trying out these three masts of ours than hell get from that bundle of bones though now that i think of it it may contain something worth a good deal more than oil yes ambergris i wonder now if our old man has thought of that its worth trying yes im for it and so saying he started for the quarterdeck ,MobyDick or The Whale
by this time the faint air had become a complete calm so that whether or no the pequod was now fairly entrapped in the smell with no hope of escaping except by its breezing up again issuing from the cabin stubb now called his boats crew and pulled off for the stranger drawing across her bow he perceived that in accordance with the fanciful french taste the upper part of her stempiece was carved in the likeness of a huge drooping stalk was painted green and for thorns had copper spikes projecting from it here and there the whole terminating in a symmetrical folded bulb of a bright red colour upon her head boards in large gilt letters he read bouton de roserosebutton or rosebud and this was the romantic name of this aromatic ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
then rapidly pulling back towards the pequod and seeing ahab leaning over the quarterdeck rail awaiting his report he moulded his two hands into a trumpet and shoutedno sir no upon which ahab retired and stubb returned to the frenchman ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh keep coolcool yes thats the word why dont you pack those whales in ice while youre working at em but joking aside though do you know rosebud that its all nonsense trying to get any oil out of such whales as for that dried up one there he hasnt a gill in his whole carcase ,MobyDick or The Whale
i know that well enough but dye see the captain here wont believe it this is his first voyage he was a cologne manufacturer before but come aboard and mayhap hell believe you if he wont me and so ill get out of this dirty scrape ,MobyDick or The Whale
anything to oblige ye my sweet and pleasant fellow rejoined stubb and with that he soon mounted to the deck there a queer scene presented itself the sailors in tasselled caps of red worsted were getting the heavy tackles in readiness for the whales but they worked rather slow and talked very fast and seemed in anything but a good humor all their noses upwardly projected from their faces like so many jibbooms now and then pairs of them would drop their work and run up to the masthead to get some fresh air some thinking they would catch the plague dipped oakum in coaltar and at intervals held it to their nostrils others having broken the stems of their pipes almost short off at the bowl were vigorously puffing tobaccosmoke so that it constantly filled their olfactories ,MobyDick or The Whale
stubb was struck by a shower of outcries and anathemas proceeding from the captains roundhouse abaft and looking in that direction saw a fiery face thrust from behind the door which was held ajar from within this was the tormented surgeon who after in vain remonstrating against the proceedings of the day had betaken himself to the captains roundhouse cabinet he called it to avoid the pest but still could not help yelling out his entreaties and indignations at times ,MobyDick or The Whale
marking all this stubb argued well for his scheme and turning to the guernseyman had a little chat with him during which the stranger mate expressed his detestation of his captain as a conceited ignoramus who had brought them all into so unsavory and unprofitable a pickle sounding him carefully stubb further perceived that the guernseyman had not the slightest suspicion concerning the ambergris he therefore held his peace on that head but otherwise was quite frank and confidential with him so that the two quickly concocted a little plan for both circumventing and satirizing the captain without his at all dreaming of distrusting their sincerity according to this little plan of theirs the guernseyman under cover of an interpreters office was to tell the captain what he pleased but as coming from stubb and as for stubb he was to utter any nonsense that should come uppermost in him during the interview ,MobyDick or The Whale
by this time their destined victim appeared from his cabin he was a small and dark but rather delicate looking man for a seacaptain with large whiskers and moustache however and wore a red cotton velvet vest with watchseals at his side to this gentleman stubb was now politely introduced by the guernseyman who at once ostentatiously put on the aspect of interpreting between them ,MobyDick or The Whale
he says monsieur said the guernseyman in french turning to his captain that only yesterday his ship spoke a vessel whose captain and chiefmate with six sailors had all died of a fever caught from a blasted whale they had brought alongside ,MobyDick or The Whale
why since he takes it so easy tell him that now i have eyed him carefully im quite certain that hes no more fit to command a whaleship than a st jago monkey in fact tell him from me hes a baboon ,MobyDick or The Whale
he says monsieur that his principles wont admit of his drinking but that if monsieur wants to live another day to drink then monsieur had best drop all four boats and pull the ship away from these whales for its so calm they wont drift ,MobyDick or The Whale
by this time stubb was over the side and getting into his boat hailed the guernseyman to this effectthat having a long towline in his boat he would do what he could to help them by pulling out the lighter whale of the two from the ships side while the frenchmans boats then were engaged in towing the ship one way stubb benevolently towed away at his whale the other way ostentatiously slacking out a most unusually long towline ,MobyDick or The Whale
presently a breeze sprang up stubb feigned to cast off from the whale hoisting his boats the frenchman soon increased his distance while the pequod slid in between him and stubbs whale whereupon stubb quickly pulled to the floating body and hailing the pequod to give notice of his intentions at once proceeded to reap the fruit of his unrighteous cunning seizing his sharp boatspade he commenced an excavation in the body a little behind the side fin you would almost have thought he was digging a cellar there in the sea and when at length his spade struck against the gaunt ribs it was like turning up old roman tiles and pottery buried in fat english loam his boats crew were all in high excitement eagerly helping their chief and looking as anxious as goldhunters ,MobyDick or The Whale
and all the time numberless fowls were diving and ducking and screaming and yelling and fighting around them stubb was beginning to look disappointed especially as the horrible nosegay increased when suddenly from out the very heart of this plague there stole a faint stream of perfume which flowed through the tide of bad smells without being absorbed by it as one river will flow into and then along with another without at all blending with it for a time ,MobyDick or The Whale
dropping his spade he thrust both hands in and drew out handfuls of something that looked like ripe windsor soap or rich mottled old cheese very unctuous and savory withal you might easily dent it with your thumb it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour and this good friends is ambergris worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist some six handfuls were obtained but more was unavoidably lost in the sea and still more perhaps might have been secured were it not for impatient ahabs loud command to stubb to desist and come on board else the ship would bid them good bye ,MobyDick or The Whale
now this ambergris is a very curious substance and so important as an article of commerce that in  a certain nantucketborn captain coffin was examined at the bar of the english house of commons on that subject for at that time and indeed until a comparatively late day the precise origin of ambergris remained like amber itself a problem to the learned though the word ambergris is but the french compound for grey amber yet the two substances are quite distinct for amber though at times found on the seacoast is also dug up in some far inland soils whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea besides amber is a hard transparent brittle odorless substance used for mouthpieces to pipes for beads and ornaments but ambergris is soft waxy and so highly fragrant and spicy that it is largely used in perfumery in pastiles precious candles hairpowders and pomatum the turks use it in cooking and also carry it to mecca for the same purpose that frankincense is carried to st peters in rome some wine merchants drop a few grains into claret to flavor it ,MobyDick or The Whale
who would think then that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick whale yet so it is by some ambergris is supposed to be the cause and by others the effect of the dyspepsia in the whale how to cure such a dyspepsia it were hard to say unless by administering three or four boat loads of brandreths pills and then running out of harms way as laborers do in blasting rocks ,MobyDick or The Whale
i have forgotten to say that there were found in this ambergris certain hard round bony plates which at first stubb thought might be sailors trowsers buttons but it afterwards turned out that they were nothing more than pieces of small squid bones embalmed in that manner ,MobyDick or The Whale
now that the incorruption of this most fragrant ambergris should be found in the heart of such decay is this nothing bethink thee of that saying of st paul in corinthians about corruption and incorruption how that we are sown in dishonor but raised in glory and likewise call to mind that saying of paracelsus about what it is that maketh the best musk also forget not the strange fact that of all things of illsavor colognewater in its rudimental manufacturing stages is the worst ,MobyDick or The Whale
i should like to conclude the chapter with the above appeal but cannot owing to my anxiety to repel a charge often made against whalemen and which in the estimation of some already biased minds might be considered as indirectly substantiated by what has been said of the frenchmans two whales elsewhere in this volume the slanderous aspersion has been disproved that the vocation of whaling is throughout a slatternly untidy business but there is another thing to rebut they hint that all whales always smell bad now how did this odious stigma originate ,MobyDick or The Whale
i opine that it is plainly traceable to the first arrival of the greenland whaling ships in london more than two centuries ago because those whalemen did not then and do not now try out their oil at sea as the southern ships have always done but cutting up the fresh blubber in small bits thrust it through the bung holes of large casks and carry it home in that manner the shortness of the season in those icy seas and the sudden and violent storms to which they are exposed forbidding any other course the consequence is that upon breaking into the hold and unloading one of these whale cemeteries in the greenland dock a savor is given forth somewhat similar to that arising from excavating an old city graveyard for the foundations of a lyingin hospital ,MobyDick or The Whale
i partly surmise also that this wicked charge against whalers may be likewise imputed to the existence on the coast of greenland in former times of a dutch village called schmerenburgh or smeerenberg which latter name is the one used by the learned fogo von slack in his great work on smells a textbook on that subject as its name imports smeer fat berg to put up this village was founded in order to afford a place for the blubber of the dutch whale fleet to be tried out without being taken home to holland for that purpose it was a collection of furnaces fatkettles and oil sheds and when the works were in full operation certainly gave forth no very pleasant savor but all this is quite different with a south sea sperm whaler which in a voyage of four years perhaps after completely filling her hold with oil does not perhaps consume fifty days in the business of boiling out and in the state that it is casked the oil is nearly scentless the truth is that living or dead if but decently treated whales as a species are by no means creatures of ill odor nor can whalemen be recognised as the people of the middle ages affected to detect a jew in the company by the nose nor indeed can the whale possibly be otherwise than fragrant when as a general thing he enjoys such high health taking abundance of exercise always out of doors though it is true seldom in the open air i say that the motion of a sperm whales flukes above water dispenses a perfume as when a muskscented lady rustles her dress in a warm parlor what then shall i liken the sperm whale to for fragrance considering his magnitude must it not be to that famous elephant with jewelled tusks and redolent with myrrh which was led out of an indian town to do honor to alexander the great ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was but some few days after encountering the frenchman that a most significant event befell the most insignificant of the pequods crew an event most lamentable and which ended in providing the sometimes madly merry and predestinated craft with a living and ever accompanying prophecy of whatever shattered sequel might prove her own ,MobyDick or The Whale
now in the whale ship it is not every one that goes in the boats some few hands are reserved called shipkeepers whose province it is to work the vessel while the boats are pursuing the whale as a general thing these shipkeepers are as hardy fellows as the men comprising the boats crews but if there happen to be an unduly slender clumsy or timorous wight in the ship that wight is certain to be made a shipkeeper it was so in the pequod with the little negro pippin by nickname pip by abbreviation poor pip ye have heard of him before ye must remember his tambourine on that dramatic midnight so gloomyjolly ,MobyDick or The Whale
in outer aspect pip and doughboy made a match like a black pony and a white one of equal developments though of dissimilar colour driven in one eccentric span but while hapless doughboy was by nature dull and torpid in his intellects pip though over tenderhearted was at bottom very bright with that pleasant genial jolly brightness peculiar to his tribe a tribe which ever enjoy all holidays and festivities with finer freer relish than any other race for blacks the years calendar should show naught but three hundred and sixtyfive fourth of julys and new years days nor smile so while i write that this little black was brilliant for even blackness has its brilliancy behold yon lustrous ebony panelled in kings cabinets but pip loved life and all lifes peaceable securities so that the panicstriking business in which he had somehow unaccountably become entrapped had most sadly blurred his brightness though as ere long will be seen what was thus temporarily subdued in him in the end was destined to be luridly illumined by strange wild fires that fictitiously showed him off to ten times the natural lustre with which in his native tolland county in connecticut he had once enlivened many a fiddlers frolic on the green and at melodious eventide with his gay haha had turned the round horizon into one starbelled tambourine so though in the clear air of day suspended against a blueveined neck the purewatered diamond drop will healthful glow yet when the cunning jeweller would show you the diamond in its most impressive lustre he lays it against a gloomy ground and then lights it up not by the sun but by some unnatural gases then come out those fiery effulgences infernally superb then the evilblazing diamond once the divinest symbol of the crystal skies looks like some crownjewel stolen from the king of hell but let us to the story ,MobyDick or The Whale
the first time stubb lowered with him pip evinced much nervousness but happily for that time escaped close contact with the whale and therefore came off not altogether discreditably though stubb observing him took care afterwards to exhort him to cherish his courageousness to the utmost for he might often find it needful ,MobyDick or The Whale
now upon the second lowering the boat paddled upon the whale and as the fish received the darted iron it gave its customary rap which happened in this instance to be right under poor pips seat the involuntary consternation of the moment caused him to leap paddle in hand out of the boat and in such a way that part of the slack whale line coming against his chest he breasted it overboard with him so as to become entangled in it when at last plumping into the water that instant the stricken whale started on a fierce run the line swiftly straightened and presto poor pip came all foaming up to the chocks of the boat remorselessly dragged there by the line which had taken several turns around his chest and neck ,MobyDick or The Whale
tashtego stood in the bows he was full of the fire of the hunt he hated pip for a poltroon snatching the boatknife from its sheath he suspended its sharp edge over the line and turning towards stubb exclaimed interrogatively cut meantime pips blue choked face plainly looked do for gods sake all passed in a flash in less than half a minute this entire thing happened ,MobyDick or The Whale
so soon as he recovered himself the poor little negro was assailed by yells and execrations from the crew tranquilly permitting these irregular cursings to evaporate stubb then in a plain businesslike but still half humorous manner cursed pip officially and that done unofficially gave him much wholesome advice the substance was never jump from a boat pip exceptbut all the rest was indefinite as the soundest advice ever is now in general stick to the boat is your true motto in whaling but cases will sometimes happen when leap from the boat is still better moreover as if perceiving at last that if he should give undiluted conscientious advice to pip he would be leaving him too wide a margin to jump in for the future stubb suddenly dropped all advice and concluded with a peremptory command stick to the boat pip or by the lord i wont pick you up if you jump mind that we cant afford to lose whales by the likes of you a whale would sell for thirty times what you would pip in alabama bear that in mind and dont jump any more hereby perhaps stubb indirectly hinted that though man loved his fellow yet man is a moneymaking animal which propensity too often interferes with his benevolence ,MobyDick or The Whale
but we are all in the hands of the gods and pip jumped again it was under very similar circumstances to the first performance but this time he did not breast out the line and hence when the whale started to run pip was left behind on the sea like a hurried travellers trunk alas stubb was but too true to his word it was a beautiful bounteous blue day the spangled sea calm and cool and flatly stretching away all round to the horizon like goldbeaters skin hammered out to the extremest bobbing up and down in that sea pips ebon head showed like a head of cloves no boatknife was lifted when he fell so rapidly astern stubbs inexorable back was turned upon him and the whale was winged in three minutes a whole mile of shoreless ocean was between pip and stubb out from the centre of the sea poor pip turned his crisp curling black head to the sun another lonely castaway though the loftiest and the brightest ,MobyDick or The Whale
now in calm weather to swim in the open ocean is as easy to the practised swimmer as to ride in a springcarriage ashore but the awful lonesomeness is intolerable the intense concentration of self in the middle of such a heartless immensity my god who can tell it mark how when sailors in a dead calm bathe in the open seamark how closely they hug their ship and only coast along her sides ,MobyDick or The Whale
but had stubb really abandoned the poor little negro to his fate no he did not mean to at least because there were two boats in his wake and he supposed no doubt that they would of course come up to pip very quickly and pick him up though indeed such considerations towards oarsmen jeopardized through their own timidity is not always manifested by the hunters in all similar instances and such instances not unfrequently occur almost invariably in the fishery a coward so called is marked with the same ruthless detestation peculiar to military navies and armies ,MobyDick or The Whale
but it so happened that those boats without seeing pip suddenly spying whales close to them on one side turned and gave chase and stubbs boat was now so far away and he and all his crew so intent upon his fish that pips ringed horizon began to expand around him miserably by the merest chance the ship itself at last rescued him but from that hour the little negro went about the deck an idiot such at least they said he was the sea had jeeringly kept his finite body up but drowned the infinite of his soul not drowned entirely though rather carried down alive to wondrous depths where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and fro before his passive eyes and the misermerman wisdom revealed his hoarded heaps and among the joyous heartless everjuvenile eternities pip saw the multitudinous godomnipresent coral insects that out of the firmament of waters heaved the colossal orbs he saw gods foot upon the treadle of the loom and spoke it and therefore his shipmates called him mad so mans insanity is heavens sense and wandering from all mortal reason man comes at last to that celestial thought which to reason is absurd and frantic and weal or woe feels then uncompromised indifferent as his god ,MobyDick or The Whale
that whale of stubbs so dearly purchased was duly brought to the pequods side where all those cutting and hoisting operations previously detailed were regularly gone through even to the baling of the heidelburgh tun or case ,MobyDick or The Whale
while some were occupied with this latter duty others were employed in dragging away the larger tubs so soon as filled with the sperm and when the proper time arrived this same sperm was carefully manipulated ere going to the tryworks of which anon ,MobyDick or The Whale
it had cooled and crystallized to such a degree that when with several others i sat down before a large constantines bath of it i found it strangely concreted into lumps here and there rolling about in the liquid part it was our business to squeeze these lumps back into fluid a sweet and unctuous duty no wonder that in old times this sperm was such a favourite cosmetic such a clearer such a sweetener such a softener such a delicious molifier after having my hands in it for only a few minutes my fingers felt like eels and began as it were to serpentine and spiralise ,MobyDick or The Whale
as i sat there at my ease crosslegged on the deck after the bitter exertion at the windlass under a blue tranquil sky the ship under indolent sail and gliding so serenely along as i bathed my hands among those soft gentle globules of infiltrated tissues woven almost within the hour as they richly broke to my fingers and discharged all their opulence like fully ripe grapes their wine as i snuffed up that uncontaminated aromaliterally and truly like the smell of spring violets i declare to you that for the time i lived as in a musky meadow i forgot all about our horrible oath in that inexpressible sperm i washed my hands and my heart of it i almost began to credit the old paracelsan superstition that sperm is of rare virtue in allaying the heat of anger while bathing in that bath i felt divinely free from all illwill or petulance or malice of any sort whatsoever ,MobyDick or The Whale
squeeze squeeze squeeze all the morning long i squeezed that sperm till i myself almost melted into it i squeezed that sperm till a strange sort of insanity came over me and i found myself unwittingly squeezing my colaborers hands in it mistaking their hands for the gentle globules such an abounding affectionate friendly loving feeling did this avocation beget that at last i was continually squeezing their hands and looking up into their eyes sentimentally as much as to sayoh my dear fellow beings why should we longer cherish any social acerbities or know the slightest illhumor or envy come let us squeeze hands all round nay let us all squeeze ourselves into each other let us squeeze ourselves universally into the very milk and sperm of kindness ,MobyDick or The Whale
would that i could keep squeezing that sperm for ever for now since by many prolonged repeated experiences i have perceived that in all cases man must eventually lower or at least shift his conceit of attainable felicity not placing it anywhere in the intellect or the fancy but in the wife the heart the bed the table the saddle the fireside the country now that i have perceived all this i am ready to squeeze case eternally in thoughts of the visions of the night i saw long rows of angels in paradise each with his hands in a jar of spermaceti ,MobyDick or The Whale
first comes whitehorse so called which is obtained from the tapering part of the fish and also from the thicker portions of his flukes it is tough with congealed tendonsa wad of musclebut still contains some oil after being severed from the whale the whitehorse is first cut into portable oblongs ere going to the mincer they look much like blocks of berkshire marble ,MobyDick or The Whale
plumpudding is the term bestowed upon certain fragmentary parts of the whales flesh here and there adhering to the blanket of blubber and often participating to a considerable degree in its unctuousness it is a most refreshing convivial beautiful object to behold as its name imports it is of an exceedingly rich mottled tint with a bestreaked snowy and golden ground dotted with spots of the deepest crimson and purple it is plums of rubies in pictures of citron spite of reason it is hard to keep yourself from eating it i confess that once i stole behind the foremast to try it it tasted something as i should conceive a royal cutlet from the thigh of louis le gros might have tasted supposing him to have been killed the first day after the venison season and that particular venison season contemporary with an unusually fine vintage of the vineyards of champagne ,MobyDick or The Whale
there is another substance and a very singular one which turns up in the course of this business but which i feel it to be very puzzling adequately to describe it is called slobgollion an appellation original with the whalemen and even so is the nature of the substance it is an ineffably oozy stringy affair most frequently found in the tubs of sperm after a prolonged squeezing and subsequent decanting i hold it to be the wondrously thin ruptured membranes of the case coalescing ,MobyDick or The Whale
gurry so called is a term properly belonging to right whalemen but sometimes incidentally used by the sperm fishermen it designates the dark glutinous substance which is scraped off the back of the greenland or right whale and much of which covers the decks of those inferior souls who hunt that ignoble leviathan ,MobyDick or The Whale
nippers strictly this word is not indigenous to the whales vocabulary but as applied by whalemen it becomes so a whalemans nipper is a short firm strip of tendinous stuff cut from the tapering part of leviathans tail it averages an inch in thickness and for the rest is about the size of the iron part of a hoe edgewise moved along the oily deck it operates like a leathern squilgee and by nameless blandishments as of magic allures along with it all impurities ,MobyDick or The Whale
but to learn all about these recondite matters your best way is at once to descend into the blubberroom and have a long talk with its inmates this place has previously been mentioned as the receptacle for the blanketpieces when stript and hoisted from the whale when the proper time arrives for cutting up its contents this apartment is a scene of terror to all tyros especially by night on one side lit by a dull lantern a space has been left clear for the workmen they generally go in pairsa pikeandgaffman and a spademan the whalingpike is similar to a frigates boardingweapon of the same name the gaff is something like a boathook with his gaff the gaffman hooks on to a sheet of blubber and strives to hold it from slipping as the ship pitches and lurches about meanwhile the spademan stands on the sheet itself perpendicularly chopping it into the portable horsepieces this spade is sharp as hone can make it the spademans feet are shoeless the thing he stands on will sometimes irresistibly slide away from him like a sledge if he cuts off one of his own toes or one of his assistants would you be very much astonished toes are scarce among veteran blubberroom men ,MobyDick or The Whale
had you stepped on board the pequod at a certain juncture of this postmortemizing of the whale and had you strolled forward nigh the windlass pretty sure am i that you would have scanned with no small curiosity a very strange enigmatical object which you would have seen there lying along lengthwise in the lee scuppers not the wondrous cistern in the whales huge head not the prodigy of his unhinged lower jaw not the miracle of his symmetrical tail none of these would so surprise you as half a glimpse of that unaccountable conelonger than a kentuckian is tall nigh a foot in diameter at the base and jetblack as yojo the ebony idol of queequeg and an idol indeed it is or rather in old times its likeness was such an idol as that found in the secret groves of queen maachah in judea and for worshipping which king asa her son did depose her and destroyed the idol and burnt it for an abomination at the brook kedron as darkly set forth in the th chapter of the first book of kings ,MobyDick or The Whale
look at the sailor called the mincer who now comes along and assisted by two allies heavily backs the grandissimus as the mariners call it and with bowed shoulders staggers off with it as if he were a grenadier carrying a dead comrade from the field extending it upon the forecastle deck he now proceeds cylindrically to remove its dark pelt as an african hunter the pelt of a boa this done he turns the pelt inside out like a pantaloon leg gives it a good stretching so as almost to double its diameter and at last hangs it well spread in the rigging to dry ere long it is taken down when removing some three feet of it towards the pointed extremity and then cutting two slits for armholes at the other end he lengthwise slips himself bodily into it the mincer now stands before you invested in the full canonicals of his calling immemorial to all his order this investiture alone will adequately protect him while employed in the peculiar functions of his office ,MobyDick or The Whale
that office consists in mincing the horsepieces of blubber for the pots an operation which is conducted at a curious wooden horse planted endwise against the bulwarks and with a capacious tub beneath it into which the minced pieces drop fast as the sheets from a rapt orators desk arrayed in decent black occupying a conspicuous pulpit intent on bible leaves what a candidate for an archbishopric what a lad for a pope were this mincer ,MobyDick or The Whale
bible leaves bible leaves this is the invariable cry from the mates to the mincer it enjoins him to be careful and cut his work into as thin slices as possible inasmuch as by so doing the business of boiling out the oil is much accelerated and its quantity considerably increased besides perhaps improving it in quality ,MobyDick or The Whale
besides her hoisted boats an american whaler is outwardly distinguished by her tryworks she presents the curious anomaly of the most solid masonry joining with oak and hemp in constituting the completed ship it is as if from the open field a brickkiln were transported to her planks ,MobyDick or The Whale
the tryworks are planted between the foremast and mainmast the most roomy part of the deck the timbers beneath are of a peculiar strength fitted to sustain the weight of an almost solid mass of brick and mortar some ten feet by eight square and five in height the foundation does not penetrate the deck but the masonry is firmly secured to the surface by ponderous knees of iron bracing it on all sides and screwing it down to the timbers on the flanks it is cased with wood and at top completely covered by a large sloping battened hatchway removing this hatch we expose the great trypots two in number and each of several barrels capacity when not in use they are kept remarkably clean sometimes they are polished with soapstone and sand till they shine within like silver punchbowls during the nightwatches some cynical old sailors will crawl into them and coil themselves away there for a nap while employed in polishing themone man in each pot side by sidemany confidential communications are carried on over the iron lips it is a place also for profound mathematical meditation it was in the left hand trypot of the pequod with the soapstone diligently circling round me that i was first indirectly struck by the remarkable fact that in geometry all bodies gliding along the cycloid my soapstone for example will descend from any point in precisely the same time ,MobyDick or The Whale
removing the fireboard from the front of the tryworks the bare masonry of that side is exposed penetrated by the two iron mouths of the furnaces directly underneath the pots these mouths are fitted with heavy doors of iron the intense heat of the fire is prevented from communicating itself to the deck by means of a shallow reservoir extending under the entire inclosed surface of the works by a tunnel inserted at the rear this reservoir is kept replenished with water as fast as it evaporates there are no external chimneys they open direct from the rear wall and here let us go back for a moment ,MobyDick or The Whale
all ready there off hatch then and start her you cook fire the works this was an easy thing for the carpenter had been thrusting his shavings into the furnace throughout the passage here be it said that in a whaling voyage the first fire in the tryworks has to be fed for a time with wood after that no wood is used except as a means of quick ignition to the staple fuel in a word after being tried out the crisp shrivelled blubber now called scraps or fritters still contains considerable of its unctuous properties these fritters feed the flames like a plethoric burning martyr or a selfconsuming misanthrope once ignited the whale supplies his own fuel and burns by his own body would that he consumed his own smoke for his smoke is horrible to inhale and inhale it you must and not only that but you must live in it for the time it has an unspeakable wild hindoo odor about it such as may lurk in the vicinity of funereal pyres it smells like the left wing of the day of judgment it is an argument for the pit ,MobyDick or The Whale
by midnight the works were in full operation we were clear from the carcase sail had been made the wind was freshening the wild ocean darkness was intense but that darkness was licked up by the fierce flames which at intervals forked forth from the sooty flues and illuminated every lofty rope in the rigging as with the famed greek fire the burning ship drove on as if remorselessly commissioned to some vengeful deed so the pitch and sulphurfreighted brigs of the bold hydriote canaris issuing from their midnight harbors with broad sheets of flame for sails bore down upon the turkish frigates and folded them in conflagrations ,MobyDick or The Whale
the hatch removed from the top of the works now afforded a wide hearth in front of them standing on this were the tartarean shapes of the pagan harpooneers always the whaleships stokers with huge pronged poles they pitched hissing masses of blubber into the scalding pots or stirred up the fires beneath till the snaky flames darted curling out of the doors to catch them by the feet the smoke rolled away in sullen heaps to every pitch of the ship there was a pitch of the boiling oil which seemed all eagerness to leap into their faces opposite the mouth of the works on the further side of the wide wooden hearth was the windlass this served for a seasofa here lounged the watch when not otherwise employed looking into the red heat of the fire till their eyes felt scorched in their heads their tawny features now all begrimed with smoke and sweat their matted beards and the contrasting barbaric brilliancy of their teeth all these were strangely revealed in the capricious emblazonings of the works as they narrated to each other their unholy adventures their tales of terror told in words of mirth as their uncivilized laughter forked upwards out of them like the flames from the furnace as to and fro in their front the harpooneers wildly gesticulated with their huge pronged forks and dippers as the wind howled on and the sea leaped and the ship groaned and dived and yet steadfastly shot her red hell further and further into the blackness of the sea and the night and scornfully champed the white bone in her mouth and viciously spat round her on all sides then the rushing pequod freighted with savages and laden with fire and burning a corpse and plunging into that blackness of darkness seemed the material counterpart of her monomaniac commanders soul ,MobyDick or The Whale
so seemed it to me as i stood at her helm and for long hours silently guided the way of this fireship on the sea wrapped for that interval in darkness myself i but the better saw the redness the madness the ghastliness of others the continual sight of the fiend shapes before me capering half in smoke and half in fire these at last begat kindred visions in my soul so soon as i began to yield to that unaccountable drowsiness which ever would come over me at a midnight helm ,MobyDick or The Whale
but that night in particular a strange and ever since inexplicable thing occurred to me starting from a brief standing sleep i was horribly conscious of something fatally wrong the jawbone tiller smote my side which leaned against it in my ears was the low hum of sails just beginning to shake in the wind i thought my eyes were open i was half conscious of putting my fingers to the lids and mechanically stretching them still further apart but spite of all this i could see no compass before me to steer by though it seemed but a minute since i had been watching the card by the steady binnacle lamp illuminating it nothing seemed before me but a jet gloom now and then made ghastly by flashes of redness uppermost was the impression that whatever swift rushing thing i stood on was not so much bound to any haven ahead as rushing from all havens astern a stark bewildered feeling as of death came over me convulsively my hands grasped the tiller but with the crazy conceit that the tiller was somehow in some enchanted way inverted my god what is the matter with me thought i lo in my brief sleep i had turned myself about and was fronting the ships stern with my back to her prow and the compass in an instant i faced back just in time to prevent the vessel from flying up into the wind and very probably capsizing her how glad and how grateful the relief from this unnatural hallucination of the night and the fatal contingency of being brought by the lee ,MobyDick or The Whale
look not too long in the face of the fire o man never dream with thy hand on the helm turn not thy back to the compass accept the first hint of the hitching tiller believe not the artificial fire when its redness makes all things look ghastly tomorrow in the natural sun the skies will be bright those who glared like devils in the forking flames the morn will show in far other at least gentler relief the glorious golden glad sun the only true lampall others but liars ,MobyDick or The Whale
nevertheless the sun hides not virginias dismal swamp nor romes accursed campagna nor wide sahara nor all the millions of miles of deserts and of griefs beneath the moon the sun hides not the ocean which is the dark side of this earth and which is two thirds of this earth so therefore that mortal man who hath more of joy than sorrow in him that mortal man cannot be truenot true or undeveloped with books the same the truest of all men was the man of sorrows and the truest of all books is solomons and ecclesiastes is the fine hammered steel of woe all is vanity all this wilful world hath not got hold of unchristian solomons wisdom yet but he who dodges hospitals and jails and walks fast crossing graveyards and would rather talk of operas than hell calls cowper young pascal rousseau poor devils all of sick men and throughout a carefree lifetime swears by rabelais as passing wise and therefore jollynot that man is fitted to sit down on tombstones and break the green damp mould with unfathomably wondrous solomon ,MobyDick or The Whale
but even solomon he says the man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall remain ie even while living in the congregation of the dead give not thyself up then to fire lest it invert thee deaden thee as for the time it did me there is a wisdom that is woe but there is a woe that is madness and there is a catskill eagle in some souls that can alike dive down into the blackest gorges and soar out of them again and become invisible in the sunny spaces and even if he for ever flies within the gorge that gorge is in the mountains so that even in his lowest swoop the mountain eagle is still higher than other birds upon the plain even though they soar ,MobyDick or The Whale
had you descended from the pequods tryworks to the pequods forecastle where the off duty watch were sleeping for one single moment you would have almost thought you were standing in some illuminated shrine of canonized kings and counsellors there they lay in their triangular oaken vaults each mariner a chiselled muteness a score of lamps flashing upon his hooded eyes ,MobyDick or The Whale
in merchantmen oil for the sailor is more scarce than the milk of queens to dress in the dark and eat in the dark and stumble in darkness to his pallet this is his usual lot but the whaleman as he seeks the food of light so he lives in light he makes his berth an aladdins lamp and lays him down in it so that in the pitchiest night the ships black hull still houses an illumination ,MobyDick or The Whale
see with what entire freedom the whaleman takes his handful of lampsoften but old bottles and vials thoughto the copper cooler at the tryworks and replenishes them there as mugs of ale at a vat he burns too the purest of oil in its unmanufactured and therefore unvitiated state a fluid unknown to solar lunar or astral contrivances ashore it is sweet as early grass butter in april he goes and hunts for his oil so as to be sure of its freshness and genuineness even as the traveller on the prairie hunts up his own supper of game ,MobyDick or The Whale
already has it been related how the great leviathan is afar off descried from the masthead how he is chased over the watery moors and slaughtered in the valleys of the deep how he is then towed alongside and beheaded and how on the principle which entitled the headsman of old to the garments in which the beheaded was killed his great padded surtout becomes the property of his executioner how in due time he is condemned to the pots and like shadrach meshach and abednego his spermaceti oil and bone pass unscathed through the firebut now it remains to conclude the last chapter of this part of the description by rehearsingsinging if i maythe romantic proceeding of decanting off his oil into the casks and striking them down into the hold where once again leviathan returns to his native profundities sliding along beneath the surface as before but alas never more to rise and blow ,MobyDick or The Whale
while still warm the oil like hot punch is received into the sixbarrel casks and while perhaps the ship is pitching and rolling this way and that in the midnight sea the enormous casks are slewed round and headed over end for end and sometimes perilously scoot across the slippery deck like so many land slides till at last manhandled and stayed in their course and all round the hoops rap rap go as many hammers as can play upon them for now ex officio every sailor is a cooper ,MobyDick or The Whale
at length when the last pint is casked and all is cool then the great hatchways are unsealed the bowels of the ship are thrown open and down go the casks to their final rest in the sea this done the hatches are replaced and hermetically closed like a closet walled up ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the sperm fishery this is perhaps one of the most remarkable incidents in all the business of whaling one day the planks stream with freshets of blood and oil on the sacred quarterdeck enormous masses of the whales head are profanely piled great rusty casks lie about as in a brewery yard the smoke from the tryworks has besooted all the bulwarks the mariners go about suffused with unctuousness the entire ship seems great leviathan himself while on all hands the din is deafening ,MobyDick or The Whale
but a day or two after you look about you and prick your ears in this selfsame ship and were it not for the telltale boats and tryworks you would all but swear you trod some silent merchant vessel with a most scrupulously neat commander the unmanufactured sperm oil possesses a singularly cleansing virtue this is the reason why the decks never look so white as just after what they call an affair of oil besides from the ashes of the burned scraps of the whale a potent lye is readily made and whenever any adhesiveness from the back of the whale remains clinging to the side that lye quickly exterminates it hands go diligently along the bulwarks and with buckets of water and rags restore them to their full tidiness the soot is brushed from the lower rigging all the numerous implements which have been in use are likewise faithfully cleansed and put away the great hatch is scrubbed and placed upon the tryworks completely hiding the pots every cask is out of sight all tackles are coiled in unseen nooks and when by the combined and simultaneous industry of almost the entire ships company the whole of this conscientious duty is at last concluded then the crew themselves proceed to their own ablutions shift themselves from top to toe and finally issue to the immaculate deck fresh and all aglow as bridegrooms newleaped from out the daintiest holland ,MobyDick or The Whale
now with elated step they pace the planks in twos and threes and humorously discourse of parlors sofas carpets and fine cambrics propose to mat the deck think of having hanging to the top object not to taking tea by moonlight on the piazza of the forecastle to hint to such musked mariners of oil and bone and blubber were little short of audacity they know not the thing you distantly allude to away and bring us napkins ,MobyDick or The Whale
but mark aloft there at the three mast heads stand three men intent on spying out more whales which if caught infallibly will again soil the old oaken furniture and drop at least one small greasespot somewhere yes and many is the time when after the severest uninterrupted labors which know no night continuing straight through for ninetysix hours when from the boat where they have swelled their wrists with all day rowing on the linethey only step to the deck to carry vast chains and heave the heavy windlass and cut and slash yea and in their very sweatings to be smoked and burned anew by the combined fires of the equatorial sun and the equatorial tryworks when on the heel of all this they have finally bestirred themselves to cleanse the ship and make a spotless dairy room of it many is the time the poor fellows just buttoning the necks of their clean frocks are startled by the cry of there she blows and away they fly to fight another whale and go through the whole weary thing again oh my friends but this is mankilling yet this is life for hardly have we mortals by long toilings extracted from this worlds vast bulk its small but valuable sperm and then with weary patience cleansed ourselves from its defilements and learned to live here in clean tabernacles of the soul hardly is this done whenthere she blowsthe ghost is spouted up and away we sail to fight some other world and go through young lifes old routine again ,MobyDick or The Whale

ere now it has been related how ahab was wont to pace his quarterdeck taking regular turns at either limit the binnacle and mainmast but in the multiplicity of other things requiring narration it has not been added how that sometimes in these walks when most plunged in his mood he was wont to pause in turn at each spot and stand there strangely eyeing the particular object before him when he halted before the binnacle with his glance fastened on the pointed needle in the compass that glance shot like a javelin with the pointed intensity of his purpose and when resuming his walk he again paused before the mainmast then as the same riveted glance fastened upon the riveted gold coin there he still wore the same aspect of nailed firmness only dashed with a certain wild longing if not hopefulness ,MobyDick or The Whale
but one morning turning to pass the doubloon he seemed to be newly attracted by the strange figures and inscriptions stamped on it as though now for the first time beginning to interpret for himself in some monomaniac way whatever significance might lurk in them and some certain significance lurks in all things else all things are little worth and the round world itself but an empty cipher except to sell by the cartload as they do hills about boston to fill up some morass in the milky way ,MobyDick or The Whale
now this doubloon was of purest virgin gold raked somewhere out of the heart of gorgeous hills whence east and west over golden sands the headwaters of many a pactolus flows and though now nailed amidst all the rustiness of iron bolts and the verdigris of copper spikes yet untouchable and immaculate to any foulness it still preserved its quito glow nor though placed amongst a ruthless crew and every hour passed by ruthless hands and through the livelong nights shrouded with thick darkness which might cover any pilfering approach nevertheless every sunrise found the doubloon where the sunset left it last for it was set apart and sanctified to one awestriking end and however wanton in their sailor ways one and all the mariners revered it as the white whales talisman sometimes they talked it over in the weary watch by night wondering whose it was to be at last and whether he would ever live to spend it ,MobyDick or The Whale
now those noble golden coins of south america are as medals of the sun and tropic tokenpieces here palms alpacas and volcanoes suns disks and stars ecliptics hornsofplenty and rich banners waving are in luxuriant profusion stamped so that the precious gold seems almost to derive an added preciousness and enhancing glories by passing through those fancy mints so spanishly poetic ,MobyDick or The Whale
it so chanced that the doubloon of the pequod was a most wealthy example of these things on its round border it bore the letters republica del ecuador quito so this bright coin came from a country planted in the middle of the world and beneath the great equator and named after it and it had been cast midway up the andes in the unwaning clime that knows no autumn zoned by those letters you saw the likeness of three andes summits from one a flame a tower on another on the third a crowing cock while arching over all was a segment of the partitioned zodiac the signs all marked with their usual cabalistics and the keystone sun entering the equinoctial point at libra ,MobyDick or The Whale
theres something ever egotistical in mountaintops and towers and all other grand and lofty things look herethree peaks as proud as lucifer the firm tower that is ahab the volcano that is ahab the courageous the undaunted and victorious fowl that too is ahab all are ahab and this round gold is but the image of the rounder globe which like a magicians glass to each and every man in turn but mirrors back his own mysterious self great pains small gains for those who ask the world to solve them it cannot solve itself methinks now this coined sun wears a ruddy face but see aye he enters the sign of storms the equinox and but six months before he wheeled out of a former equinox at aries from storm to storm so be it then born in throes tis fit that man should live in pains and die in pangs so be it then heres stout stuff for woe to work on so be it then ,MobyDick or The Whale
no fairy fingers can have pressed the gold but devils claws must have left their mouldings there since yesterday murmured starbuck to himself leaning against the bulwarks the old man seems to read belshazzars awful writing i have never marked the coin inspectingly he goes below let me read a dark valley between three mighty heavenabiding peaks that almost seem the trinity in some faint earthly symbol so in this vale of death god girds us round and over all our gloom the sun of righteousness still shines a beacon and a hope if we bend down our eyes the dark vale shows her mouldy soil but if we lift them the bright sun meets our glance half way to cheer yet oh the great sun is no fixture and if at midnight we would fain snatch some sweet solace from him we gaze for him in vain this coin speaks wisely mildly truly but still sadly to me i will quit it lest truth shake me falsely ,MobyDick or The Whale
there nows the old mogul soliloquized stubb by the tryworks hes been twigging it and there goes starbuck from the same and both with faces which i should say might be somewhere within nine fathoms long and all from looking at a piece of gold which did i have it now on negro hill or in corlaers hook id not look at it very long ere spending it humph in my poor insignificant opinion i regard this as queer i have seen doubloons before now in my voyagings your doubloons of old spain your doubloons of peru your doubloons of chili your doubloons of bolivia your doubloons of popayan with plenty of gold moidores and pistoles and joes and half joes and quarter joes what then should there be in this doubloon of the equator that is so killing wonderful by golconda let me read it once halloa heres signs and wonders truly that now is what old bowditch in his epitome calls the zodiac and what my almanac below calls ditto ill get the almanac and as i have heard devils can be raised with dabolls arithmetic ill try my hand at raising a meaning out of these queer curvicues here with the massachusetts calendar heres the book lets see now signs and wonders and the sun hes always among em hem hem hem here they arehere they goall alivearies or the ram taurus or the bull and jimimi heres gemini himself or the twins well the sun he wheels among em aye here on the coin hes just crossing the threshold between two of twelve sittingrooms all in a ring book you lie there the fact is you books must know your places youll do to give us the bare words and facts but we come in to supply the thoughts thats my small experience so far as the massachusetts calendar and bowditchs navigator and dabolls arithmetic go signs and wonders eh pity if there is nothing wonderful in signs and significant in wonders theres a clue somewhere wait a bit histhark by jove i have it look you doubloon your zodiac here is the life of man in one round almanack to begin theres aries or the ramlecherous dog he begets us then taurus or the bullhe bumps us the first thing then gemini or the twinsthat is virtue and vice we try to reach virtue when lo comes cancer the crab and drags us back and here going from virtue leo a roaring lion lies in the pathhe gives a few fierce bites and surly dabs with his paw we escape and hail virgo the virgin thats our first love we marry and think to be happy for aye when pop comes libra or the scaleshappiness weighed and found wanting and while we are very sad about that lord how we suddenly jump as scorpio or the scorpion stings us in the rear we are curing the wound when whang come the arrows all round sagittarius or the archer is amusing himself as we pluck out the shafts stand aside heres the batteringram capricornus or the goat full tilt he comes rushing and headlong we are tossed when aquarius or the waterbearer pours out his whole deluge and drowns us and to wind up with pisces or the fishes we sleep theres a sermon now writ in high heaven and the sun goes through it every year and yet comes out of it all alive and hearty jollily he aloft there wheels through toil and trouble and so alow here does jolly stubb oh jollys the word for aye adieu doubloon but stop here comes little kingpost dodge round the tryworks now and lets hear what hell have to say there hes before it hell out with something presently so so hes beginning ,MobyDick or The Whale

heres the ships navel this doubloon here and they are all on fire to unscrew it but unscrew your navel and whats the consequence then again if it stays here that is ugly too for when aughts nailed to the mast its a sign that things grow desperate ha ha old ahab the white whale hell nail ye this is a pine tree my father in old tolland county cut down a pine tree once and found a silver ring grown over in it some old darkeys wedding ring how did it get there and so theyll say in the resurrection when they come to fish up this old mast and find a doubloon lodged in it with bedded oysters for the shaggy bark oh the gold the precious precious gold the green miserll hoard ye soon hish hish god goes mong the worlds blackberrying cook ho cook and cook us jenny hey hey hey hey hey jenny jenny and get your hoecake done ,MobyDick or The Whale
so cried ahab once more hailing a ship showing english colours bearing down under the stern trumpet to mouth the old man was standing in his hoisted quarterboat his ivory leg plainly revealed to the stranger captain who was carelessly reclining in his own boats bow he was a darklytanned burly goodnatured finelooking man of sixty or thereabouts dressed in a spacious roundabout that hung round him in festoons of blue pilotcloth and one empty arm of this jacket streamed behind him like the broidered arm of a hussars surcoat ,MobyDick or The Whale
in less than a minute without quitting his little craft he and his crew were dropped to the water and were soon alongside of the stranger but here a curious difficulty presented itself in the excitement of the moment ahab had forgotten that since the loss of his leg he had never once stepped on board of any vessel at sea but his own and then it was always by an ingenious and very handy mechanical contrivance peculiar to the pequod and a thing not to be rigged and shipped in any other vessel at a moments warning now it is no very easy matter for anybodyexcept those who are almost hourly used to it like whalemento clamber up a ships side from a boat on the open sea for the great swells now lift the boat high up towards the bulwarks and then instantaneously drop it half way down to the kelson so deprived of one leg and the strange ship of course being altogether unsupplied with the kindly invention ahab now found himself abjectly reduced to a clumsy landsman again hopelessly eyeing the uncertain changeful height he could hardly hope to attain ,MobyDick or The Whale
it has before been hinted perhaps that every little untoward circumstance that befell him and which indirectly sprang from his luckless mishap almost invariably irritated or exasperated ahab and in the present instance all this was heightened by the sight of the two officers of the strange ship leaning over the side by the perpendicular ladder of nailed cleets there and swinging towards him a pair of tastefullyornamented manropes for at first they did not seem to bethink them that a onelegged man must be too much of a cripple to use their sea bannisters but this awkwardness only lasted a minute because the strange captain observing at a glance how affairs stood cried out i see i seeavast heaving there jump boys and swing over the cuttingtackle ,MobyDick or The Whale
as good luck would have it they had had a whale alongside a day or two previous and the great tackles were still aloft and the massive curved blubberhook now clean and dry was still attached to the end this was quickly lowered to ahab who at once comprehending it all slid his solitary thigh into the curve of the hook it was like sitting in the fluke of an anchor or the crotch of an apple tree and then giving the word held himself fast and at the same time also helped to hoist his own weight by pulling handoverhand upon one of the running parts of the tackle soon he was carefully swung inside the high bulwarks and gently landed upon the capstan head with his ivory arm frankly thrust forth in welcome the other captain advanced and ahab putting out his ivory leg and crossing the ivory arm like two swordfish blades cried out in his walrus way aye aye hearty let us shake bones togetheran arm and a legan arm that never can shrink dye see and a leg that never can run where didst thou see the white whalehow long ago ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was the first time in my life that i ever cruised on the line began the englishman i was ignorant of the white whale at that time well one day we lowered for a pod of four or five whales and my boat fastened to one of them a regular circus horse he was too that went milling and milling round so that my boats crew could only trim dish by sitting all their sterns on the outer gunwale presently up breaches from the bottom of the sea a bouncing great whale with a milkywhite head and hump all crows feet and wrinkles ,MobyDick or The Whale
how it was exactly continued the onearmed commander i do not know but in biting the line it got foul of his teeth caught there somehow but we didnt know it then so that when we afterwards pulled on the line bounce we came plump on to his hump instead of the other whales that went off to windward all fluking seeing how matters stood and what a noble great whale it wasthe noblest and biggest i ever saw sir in my lifei resolved to capture him spite of the boiling rage he seemed to be in and thinking the haphazard line would get loose or the tooth it was tangled to might draw for i have a devil of a boats crew for a pull on a whaleline seeing all this i say i jumped into my first mates boatmr mounttops here by the way captainmounttop mounttopthe captainas i was saying i jumped into mounttops boat which dye see was gunwale and gunwale with mine then and snatching the first harpoon let this old greatgrandfather have it but lord look you sirhearts and souls alive manthe next instant in a jiff i was blind as a batboth eyes outall befogged and bedeadened with black foamthe whales tail looming straight up out of it perpendicular in the air like a marble steeple no use sterning all then but as i was groping at midday with a blinding sun all crownjewels as i was groping i say after the second iron to toss it overboarddown comes the tail like a lima tower cutting my boat in two leaving each half in splinters and flukes first the white hump backed through the wreck as though it was all chips we all struck out to escape his terrible flailings i seized hold of my harpoonpole sticking in him and for a moment clung to that like a sucking fish but a combing sea dashed me off and at the same instant the fish taking one good dart forwards went down like a flash and the barb of that cursed second iron towing along near me caught me here clapping his hand just below his shoulder yes caught me just here i say and bore me down to hells flames i was thinking when when all of a sudden thank the good god the barb ript its way along the fleshclear along the whole length of my armcame out nigh my wrist and up i floatedand that gentleman there will tell you the rest by the way captaindr bunger ships surgeon bunger my ladthe captain now bunger boy spin your part of the yarn ,MobyDick or The Whale
the professional gentleman thus familiarly pointed out had been all the time standing near them with nothing specific visible to denote his gentlemanly rank on board his face was an exceedingly round but sober one he was dressed in a faded blue woollen frock or shirt and patched trowsers and had thus far been dividing his attention between a marlingspike he held in one hand and a pillbox held in the other occasionally casting a critical glance at the ivory limbs of the two crippled captains but at his superiors introduction of him to ahab he politely bowed and straightway went on to do his captains bidding ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh very severe chimed in the patient himself then suddenly altering his voice drinking hot rum toddies with me every night till he couldnt see to put on the bandages and sending me to bed half seas over about three oclock in the morning oh ye stars he sat up with me indeed and was very severe in my diet oh a great watcher and very dietetically severe is dr bunger bunger you dog laugh out why dont ye you know youre a precious jolly rascal but heave ahead boy id rather be killed by you than kept alive by any other man ,MobyDick or The Whale
my captain you must have ere this perceived respected sirsaid the imperturbable godlylooking bunger slightly bowing to ahabis apt to be facetious at times he spins us many clever things of that sort but i may as well sayen passant as the french remarkthat i myselfthat is to say jack bunger late of the reverend clergyam a strict total abstinence man i never drink ,MobyDick or The Whale
yes i may as well said the surgeon coolly i was about observing sir before captain boomers facetious interruption that spite of my best and severest endeavors the wound kept getting worse and worse the truth was sir it was as ugly gaping wound as surgeon ever saw more than two feet and several inches long i measured it with the lead line in short it grew black i knew what was threatened and off it came but i had no hand in shipping that ivory arm there that thing is against all rulepointing at it with the marlingspikethat is the captains work not mine he ordered the carpenter to make it he had that clubhammer there put to the end to knock some ones brains out with i suppose as he tried mine once he flies into diabolical passions sometimes do ye see this dent sirremoving his hat and brushing aside his hair and exposing a bowllike cavity in his skull but which bore not the slightest scarry trace or any token of ever having been a woundwell the captain there will tell you how that came here he knows ,MobyDick or The Whale
no i dont said the captain but his mother did he was born with it oh you solemn rogue youyou bunger was there ever such another bunger in the watery world bunger when you die you ought to die in pickle you dog you should be preserved to future ages you rascal ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh cried the onearmed captain oh yes well after he sounded we didnt see him again for some time in fact as i before hinted i didnt then know what whale it was that had served me such a trick till some time afterwards when coming back to the line we heard about moby dickas some call himand then i knew it was he ,MobyDick or The Whale
well then interrupted bunger give him your left arm for bait to get the right do you know gentlemenvery gravely and mathematically bowing to each captain in successiondo you know gentlemen that the digestive organs of the whale are so inscrutably constructed by divine providence that it is quite impossible for him to completely digest even a mans arm and he knows it too so that what you take for the white whales malice is only his awkwardness for he never means to swallow a single limb he only thinks to terrify by feints but sometimes he is like the old juggling fellow formerly a patient of mine in ceylon that making believe swallow jackknives once upon a time let one drop into him in good earnest and there it stayed for a twelvemonth or more when i gave him an emetic and he heaved it up in small tacks dye see no possible way for him to digest that jackknife and fully incorporate it into his general bodily system yes captain boomer if you are quick enough about it and have a mind to pawn one arm for the sake of the privilege of giving decent burial to the other why in that case the arm is yours only let the whale have another chance at you shortly thats all ,MobyDick or The Whale
no thank ye bunger said the english captain hes welcome to the arm he has since i cant help it and didnt know him then but not to another one no more white whales for me ive lowered for him once and that has satisfied me there would be great glory in killing him i know that and there is a shipload of precious sperm in him but hark ye hes best let alone dont you think so captainglancing at the ivory leg ,MobyDick or The Whale
bless my soul and curse the foul fiends cried bunger stoopingly walking round ahab and like a dog strangely snuffing this mans bloodbring the thermometerits at the boiling pointhis pulse makes these planks beatsirtaking a lancet from his pocket and drawing near to ahabs arm ,MobyDick or The Whale
in a moment he was standing in the boats stern and the manilla men were springing to their oars in vain the english captain hailed him with back to the stranger ship and face set like a flint to his own ahab stood upright till alongside of the pequod ,MobyDick or The Whale
ere the english ship fades from sight be it set down here that she hailed from london and was named after the late samuel enderby merchant of that city the original of the famous whaling house of enderby  sons a house which in my poor whalemans opinion comes not far behind the united royal houses of the tudors and bourbons in point of real historical interest how long prior to the year of our lord  this great whaling house was in existence my numerous fishdocuments do not make plain but in that year  it fitted out the first english ships that ever regularly hunted the sperm whale though for some score of years previous ever since  our valiant coffins and maceys of nantucket and the vineyard had in large fleets pursued that leviathan but only in the north and south atlantic not elsewhere be it distinctly recorded here that the nantucketers were the first among mankind to harpoon with civilized steel the great sperm whale and that for half a century they were the only people of the whole globe who so harpooned him ,MobyDick or The Whale
in  a fine ship the amelia fitted out for the express purpose and at the sole charge of the vigorous enderbys boldly rounded cape horn and was the first among the nations to lower a whaleboat of any sort in the great south sea the voyage was a skilful and lucky one and returning to her berth with her hold full of the precious sperm the amelias example was soon followed by other ships english and american and thus the vast sperm whale grounds of the pacific were thrown open but not content with this good deed the indefatigable house again bestirred itself samuel and all his sonshow many their mother only knowsand under their immediate auspices and partly i think at their expense the british government was induced to send the sloopofwar rattler on a whaling voyage of discovery into the south sea commanded by a naval postcaptain the rattler made a rattling voyage of it and did some service how much does not appear but this is not all in  the same house fitted out a discovery whale ship of their own to go on a tasting cruise to the remote waters of japan that shipwell called the syrenmade a noble experimental cruise and it was thus that the great japanese whaling ground first became generally known the syren in this famous voyage was commanded by a captain coffin a nantucketer ,MobyDick or The Whale
the ship named after him was worthy of the honor being a very fast sailer and a noble craft every way i boarded her once at midnight somewhere off the patagonian coast and drank good flip down in the forecastle it was a fine gam we had and they were all trumpsevery soul on board a short life to them and a jolly death and that fine gam i hadlong very long after old ahab touched her planks with his ivory heelit minds me of the noble solid saxon hospitality of that ship and may my parson forget me and the devil remember me if i ever lose sight of it flip did i say we had flip yes and we flipped it at the rate of ten gallons the hour and when the squall came for its squally off there by patagonia and all handsvisitors and allwere called to reef topsails we were so topheavy that we had to swing each other aloft in bowlines and we ignorantly furled the skirts of our jackets into the sails so that we hung there reefed fast in the howling gale a warning example to all drunken tars however the masts did not go overboard and by and by we scrambled down so sober that we had to pass the flip again though the savage salt spray bursting down the forecastle scuttle rather too much diluted and pickled it to my taste ,MobyDick or The Whale
the beef was finetough but with body in it they said it was bullbeef others that it was dromedary beef but i do not know for certain how that was they had dumplings too small but substantial symmetrically globular and indestructible dumplings i fancied that you could feel them and roll them about in you after they were swallowed if you stooped over too far forward you risked their pitching out of you like billiardballs the breadbut that couldnt be helped besides it was an antiscorbutic in short the bread contained the only fresh fare they had but the forecastle was not very light and it was very easy to step over into a dark corner when you ate it but all in all taking her from truck to helm considering the dimensions of the cooks boilers including his own live parchment boilers fore and aft i say the samuel enderby was a jolly ship of good fare and plenty fine flip and strong crack fellows all and capital from boot heels to hatband ,MobyDick or The Whale
but why was it think ye that the samuel enderby and some other english whalers i know ofnot all thoughwere such famous hospitable ships that passed round the beef and the bread and the can and the joke and were not soon weary of eating and drinking and laughing i will tell you the abounding good cheer of these english whalers is matter for historical research nor have i been at all sparing of historical whale research when it has seemed needed ,MobyDick or The Whale
the english were preceded in the whale fishery by the hollanders zealanders and danes from whom they derived many terms still extant in the fishery and what is yet more their fat old fashions touching plenty to eat and drink for as a general thing the english merchantship scrimps her crew but not so the english whaler hence in the english this thing of whaling good cheer is not normal and natural but incidental and particular and therefore must have some special origin which is here pointed out and will be still further elucidated ,MobyDick or The Whale
during my researches in the leviathanic histories i stumbled upon an ancient dutch volume which by the musty whaling smell of it i knew must be about whalers the title was dan coopman wherefore i concluded that this must be the invaluable memoirs of some amsterdam cooper in the fishery as every whale ship must carry its cooper i was reinforced in this opinion by seeing that it was the production of one fitz swackhammer but my friend dr snodhead a very learned man professor of low dutch and high german in the college of santa claus and st potts to whom i handed the work for translation giving him a box of sperm candles for his troublethis same dr snodhead so soon as he spied the book assured me that dan coopman did not mean the cooper but the merchant in short this ancient and learned low dutch book treated of the commerce of holland and among other subjects contained a very interesting account of its whale fishery and in this chapter it was headed smeer or fat that i found a long detailed list of the outfits for the larders and cellars of  sail of dutch whalemen from which list as translated by dr snodhead i transcribe the following ,MobyDick or The Whale
 lbs of beef  lbs friesland pork  lbs of stock fish  lbs of biscuit  lbs of soft bread  firkins of butter  lbs texel  leyden cheese  lbs cheese probably an inferior article  ankers of geneva  barrels of beer ,MobyDick or The Whale
at the time i devoted three days to the studious digesting of all this beer beef and bread during which many profound thoughts were incidentally suggested to me capable of a transcendental and platonic application and furthermore i compiled supplementary tables of my own touching the probable quantity of stockfish etc consumed by every low dutch harpooneer in that ancient greenland and spitzbergen whale fishery in the first place the amount of butter and texel and leyden cheese consumed seems amazing i impute it though to their naturally unctuous natures being rendered still more unctuous by the nature of their vocation and especially by their pursuing their game in those frigid polar seas on the very coasts of that esquimaux country where the convivial natives pledge each other in bumpers of train oil ,MobyDick or The Whale
the quantity of beer too is very large  barrels now as those polar fisheries could only be prosecuted in the short summer of that climate so that the whole cruise of one of these dutch whalemen including the short voyage to and from the spitzbergen sea did not much exceed three months say and reckoning  men to each of their fleet of  sail we have  low dutch seamen in all therefore i say we have precisely two barrels of beer per man for a twelve weeks allowance exclusive of his fair proportion of that  ankers of gin now whether these gin and beer harpooneers so fuddled as one might fancy them to have been were the right sort of men to stand up in a boats head and take good aim at flying whales this would seem somewhat improbable yet they did aim at them and hit them too but this was very far north be it remembered where beer agrees well with the constitution upon the equator in our southern fishery beer would be apt to make the harpooneer sleepy at the masthead and boozy in his boat and grievous loss might ensue to nantucket and new bedford ,MobyDick or The Whale
but no more enough has been said to show that the old dutch whalers of two or three centuries ago were high livers and that the english whalers have not neglected so excellent an example for say they when cruising in an empty ship if you can get nothing better out of the world get a good dinner out of it at least and this empties the decanter ,MobyDick or The Whale
hitherto in descriptively treating of the sperm whale i have chiefly dwelt upon the marvels of his outer aspect or separately and in detail upon some few interior structural features but to a large and thorough sweeping comprehension of him it behooves me now to unbutton him still further and untagging the points of his hose unbuckling his garters and casting loose the hooks and the eyes of the joints of his innermost bones set him before you in his ultimatum that is to say in his unconditional skeleton ,MobyDick or The Whale
but how now ishmael how is it that you a mere oarsman in the fishery pretend to know aught about the subterranean parts of the whale did erudite stubb mounted upon your capstan deliver lectures on the anatomy of the cetacea and by help of the windlass hold up a specimen rib for exhibition explain thyself ishmael can you land a fullgrown whale on your deck for examination as a cook dishes a roastpig surely not a veritable witness have you hitherto been ishmael but have a care how you seize the privilege of jonah alone the privilege of discoursing upon the joists and beams the rafters ridgepole sleepers and underpinnings making up the framework of leviathan and belike of the tallowvats dairyrooms butteries and cheeseries in his bowels ,MobyDick or The Whale
i confess that since jonah few whalemen have penetrated very far beneath the skin of the adult whale nevertheless i have been blessed with an opportunity to dissect him in miniature in a ship i belonged to a small cub sperm whale was once bodily hoisted to the deck for his poke or bag to make sheaths for the barbs of the harpoons and for the heads of the lances think you i let that chance go without using my boathatchet and jackknife and breaking the seal and reading all the contents of that young cub ,MobyDick or The Whale
and as for my exact knowledge of the bones of the leviathan in their gigantic full grown development for that rare knowledge i am indebted to my late royal friend tranquo king of tranque one of the arsacides for being at tranque years ago when attached to the tradingship dey of algiers i was invited to spend part of the arsacidean holidays with the lord of tranque at his retired palm villa at pupella a seaside glen not very far distant from what our sailors called bambootown his capital ,MobyDick or The Whale
among many other fine qualities my royal friend tranquo being gifted with a devout love for all matters of barbaric vertu had brought together in pupella whatever rare things the more ingenious of his people could invent chiefly carved woods of wonderful devices chiselled shells inlaid spears costly paddles aromatic canoes and all these distributed among whatever natural wonders the wonderfreighted tributerendering waves had cast upon his shores ,MobyDick or The Whale
chief among these latter was a great sperm whale which after an unusually long raging gale had been found dead and stranded with his head against a cocoanut tree whose plumagelike tufted droopings seemed his verdant jet when the vast body had at last been stripped of its fathomdeep enfoldings and the bones become dust dry in the sun then the skeleton was carefully transported up the pupella glen where a grand temple of lordly palms now sheltered it ,MobyDick or The Whale
the ribs were hung with trophies the vertebr were carved with arsacidean annals in strange hieroglyphics in the skull the priests kept up an unextinguished aromatic flame so that the mystic head again sent forth its vapory spout while suspended from a bough the terrific lower jaw vibrated over all the devotees like the hairhung sword that so affrighted damocles ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a wondrous sight the wood was green as mosses of the icy glen the trees stood high and haughty feeling their living sap the industrious earth beneath was as a weavers loom with a gorgeous carpet on it whereof the groundvine tendrils formed the warp and woof and the living flowers the figures all the trees with all their laden branches all the shrubs and ferns and grasses the messagecarrying air all these unceasingly were active through the lacings of the leaves the great sun seemed a flying shuttle weaving the unwearied verdure oh busy weaver unseen weaverpauseone wordwhither flows the fabric what palace may it deck wherefore all these ceaseless toilings speak weaverstay thy handbut one single word with thee naythe shuttle fliesthe figures float from forth the loom the freshetrushing carpet for ever slides away the weavergod he weaves and by that weaving is he deafened that he hears no mortal voice and by that humming we too who look on the loom are deafened and only when we escape it shall we hear the thousand voices that speak through it for even so it is in all material factories the spoken words that are inaudible among the flying spindles those same words are plainly heard without the walls bursting from the opened casements thereby have villainies been detected ah mortal then be heedful for so in all this din of the great worlds loom thy subtlest thinkings may be overheard afar ,MobyDick or The Whale
now amid the green liferestless loom of that arsacidean wood the great white worshipped skeleton lay lounginga gigantic idler yet as the everwoven verdant warp and woof intermixed and hummed around him the mighty idler seemed the cunning weaver himself all woven over with the vines every month assuming greener fresher verdure but himself a skeleton life folded death death trellised life the grim god wived with youthful life and begat him curlyheaded glories ,MobyDick or The Whale
now when with royal tranquo i visited this wondrous whale and saw the skull an altar and the artificial smoke ascending from where the real jet had issued i marvelled that the king should regard a chapel as an object of vertu he laughed but more i marvelled that the priests should swear that smoky jet of his was genuine to and fro i paced before this skeletonbrushed the vines asidebroke through the ribsand with a ball of arsacidean twine wandered eddied long amid its many winding shaded colonnades and arbours but soon my line was out and following it back i emerged from the opening where i entered i saw no living thing within naught was there but bones ,MobyDick or The Whale
cutting me a green measuringrod i once more dived within the skeleton from their arrowslit in the skull the priests perceived me taking the altitude of the final rib how now they shouted darst thou measure this our god thats for us aye priestswell how long do ye make him then but hereupon a fierce contest rose among them concerning feet and inches they cracked each others sconces with their yardsticksthe great skull echoedand seizing that lucky chance i quickly concluded my own admeasurements ,MobyDick or The Whale
these admeasurements i now propose to set before you but first be it recorded that in this matter i am not free to utter any fancied measurement i please because there are skeleton authorities you can refer to to test my accuracy there is a leviathanic museum they tell me in hull england one of the whaling ports of that country where they have some fine specimens of finbacks and other whales likewise i have heard that in the museum of manchester in new hampshire they have what the proprietors call the only perfect specimen of a greenland or river whale in the united states moreover at a place in yorkshire england burton constable by name a certain sir clifford constable has in his possession the skeleton of a sperm whale but of moderate size by no means of the fullgrown magnitude of my friend king tranquos ,MobyDick or The Whale
in both cases the stranded whales to which these two skeletons belonged were originally claimed by their proprietors upon similar grounds king tranquo seizing his because he wanted it and sir clifford because he was lord of the seignories of those parts sir cliffords whale has been articulated throughout so that like a great chest of drawers you can open and shut him in all his bony cavitiesspread out his ribs like a gigantic fanand swing all day upon his lower jaw locks are to be put upon some of his trapdoors and shutters and a footman will show round future visitors with a bunch of keys at his side sir clifford thinks of charging twopence for a peep at the whispering gallery in the spinal column threepence to hear the echo in the hollow of his cerebellum and sixpence for the unrivalled view from his forehead ,MobyDick or The Whale
the skeleton dimensions i shall now proceed to set down are copied verbatim from my right arm where i had them tattooed as in my wild wanderings at that period there was no other secure way of preserving such valuable statistics but as i was crowded for space and wished the other parts of my body to remain a blank page for a poem i was then composingat least what untattooed parts might remaini did not trouble myself with the odd inches nor indeed should inches at all enter into a congenial admeasurement of the whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
according to a careful calculation i have made and which i partly base upon captain scoresbys estimate of seventy tons for the largest sized greenland whale of sixty feet in length according to my careful calculation i say a sperm whale of the largest magnitude between eightyfive and ninety feet in length and something less than forty feet in its fullest circumference such a whale will weigh at least ninety tons so that reckoning thirteen men to a ton he would considerably outweigh the combined population of a whole village of one thousand one hundred inhabitants ,MobyDick or The Whale
having already in various ways put before you his skull spouthole jaw teeth tail forehead fins and divers other parts i shall now simply point out what is most interesting in the general bulk of his unobstructed bones but as the colossal skull embraces so very large a proportion of the entire extent of the skeleton as it is by far the most complicated part and as nothing is to be repeated concerning it in this chapter you must not fail to carry it in your mind or under your arm as we proceed otherwise you will not gain a complete notion of the general structure we are about to view ,MobyDick or The Whale
in length the sperm whales skeleton at tranque measured seventytwo feet so that when fully invested and extended in life he must have been ninety feet long for in the whale the skeleton loses about one fifth in length compared with the living body of this seventytwo feet his skull and jaw comprised some twenty feet leaving some fifty feet of plain backbone attached to this backbone for something less than a third of its length was the mighty circular basket of ribs which once enclosed his vitals ,MobyDick or The Whale
to me this vast ivoryribbed chest with the long unrelieved spine extending far away from it in a straight line not a little resembled the hull of a great ship newlaid upon the stocks when only some twenty of her naked bowribs are inserted and the keel is otherwise for the time but a long disconnected timber ,MobyDick or The Whale
the ribs were ten on a side the first to begin from the neck was nearly six feet long the second third and fourth were each successively longer till you came to the climax of the fifth or one of the middle ribs which measured eight feet and some inches from that part the remaining ribs diminished till the tenth and last only spanned five feet and some inches in general thickness they all bore a seemly correspondence to their length the middle ribs were the most arched in some of the arsacides they are used for beams whereon to lay footpath bridges over small streams ,MobyDick or The Whale
in considering these ribs i could not but be struck anew with the circumstance so variously repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale is by no means the mould of his invested form the largest of the tranque ribs one of the middle ones occupied that part of the fish which in life is greatest in depth now the greatest depth of the invested body of this particular whale must have been at least sixteen feet whereas the corresponding rib measured but little more than eight feet so that this rib only conveyed half of the true notion of the living magnitude of that part besides for some way where i now saw but a naked spine all that had been once wrapped round with tons of added bulk in flesh muscle blood and bowels still more for the ample fins i here saw but a few disordered joints and in place of the weighty and majestic but boneless flukes an utter blank ,MobyDick or The Whale
how vain and foolish then thought i for timid untravelled man to try to comprehend aright this wondrous whale by merely poring over his dead attenuated skeleton stretched in this peaceful wood no only in the heart of quickest perils only when within the eddyings of his angry flukes only on the profound unbounded sea can the fully invested whale be truly and livingly found out ,MobyDick or The Whale
there are forty and odd vertebr in all which in the skeleton are not locked together they mostly lie like the great knobbed blocks on a gothic spire forming solid courses of heavy masonry the largest a middle one is in width something less than three feet and in depth more than four the smallest where the spine tapers away into the tail is only two inches in width and looks something like a white billiardball i was told that there were still smaller ones but they had been lost by some little cannibal urchins the priests children who had stolen them to play marbles with thus we see how that the spine of even the hugest of living things tapers off at last into simple childs play ,MobyDick or The Whale
from his mighty bulk the whale affords a most congenial theme whereon to enlarge amplify and generally expatiate would you you could not compress him by good rights he should only be treated of in imperial folio not to tell over again his furlongs from spiracle to tail and the yards he measures about the waist only think of the gigantic involutions of his intestines where they lie in him like great cables and hawsers coiled away in the subterranean orlopdeck of a lineofbattleship ,MobyDick or The Whale
since i have undertaken to manhandle this leviathan it behooves me to approve myself omnisciently exhaustive in the enterprise not overlooking the minutest seminal germs of his blood and spinning him out to the uttermost coil of his bowels having already described him in most of his present habitatory and anatomical peculiarities it now remains to magnify him in an archological fossiliferous and antediluvian point of view applied to any other creature than the leviathanto an ant or a fleasuch portly terms might justly be deemed unwarrantably grandiloquent but when leviathan is the text the case is altered fain am i to stagger to this emprise under the weightiest words of the dictionary and here be it said that whenever it has been convenient to consult one in the course of these dissertations i have invariably used a huge quarto edition of johnson expressly purchased for that purpose because that famous lexicographers uncommon personal bulk more fitted him to compile a lexicon to be used by a whale author like me ,MobyDick or The Whale
one often hears of writers that rise and swell with their subject though it may seem but an ordinary one how then with me writing of this leviathan unconsciously my chirography expands into placard capitals give me a condors quill give me vesuvius crater for an inkstand friends hold my arms for in the mere act of penning my thoughts of this leviathan they weary me and make me faint with their outreaching comprehensiveness of sweep as if to include the whole circle of the sciences and all the generations of whales and men and mastodons past present and to come with all the revolving panoramas of empire on earth and throughout the whole universe not excluding its suburbs such and so magnifying is the virtue of a large and liberal theme we expand to its bulk to produce a mighty book you must choose a mighty theme no great and enduring volume can ever be written on the flea though many there be who have tried it ,MobyDick or The Whale
ere entering upon the subject of fossil whales i present my credentials as a geologist by stating that in my miscellaneous time i have been a stonemason and also a great digger of ditches canals and wells winevaults cellars and cisterns of all sorts likewise by way of preliminary i desire to remind the reader that while in the earlier geological strata there are found the fossils of monsters now almost completely extinct the subsequent relics discovered in what are called the tertiary formations seem the connecting or at any rate intercepted links between the antichronical creatures and those whose remote posterity are said to have entered the ark all the fossil whales hitherto discovered belong to the tertiary period which is the last preceding the superficial formations and though none of them precisely answer to any known species of the present time they are yet sufficiently akin to them in general respects to justify their taking rank as cetacean fossils ,MobyDick or The Whale
detached broken fossils of preadamite whales fragments of their bones and skeletons have within thirty years past at various intervals been found at the base of the alps in lombardy in france in england in scotland and in the states of louisiana mississippi and alabama among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull which in the year  was disinterred in the rue dauphine in paris a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the tuileries and bones disinterred in excavating the great docks of antwerp in napoleons time cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown leviathanic species ,MobyDick or The Whale
but by far the most wonderful of all cetacean relics was the almost complete vast skeleton of an extinct monster found in the year  on the plantation of judge creagh in alabama the awestricken credulous slaves in the vicinity took it for the bones of one of the fallen angels the alabama doctors declared it a huge reptile and bestowed upon it the name of basilosaurus but some specimen bones of it being taken across the sea to owen the english anatomist it turned out that this alleged reptile was a whale though of a departed species a significant illustration of the fact again and again repeated in this book that the skeleton of the whale furnishes but little clue to the shape of his fully invested body so owen rechristened the monster zeuglodon and in his paper read before the london geological society pronounced it in substance one of the most extraordinary creatures which the mutations of the globe have blotted out of existence ,MobyDick or The Whale
when i stand among these mighty leviathan skeletons skulls tusks jaws ribs and vertebr all characterized by partial resemblances to the existing breeds of seamonsters but at the same time bearing on the other hand similar affinities to the annihilated antichronical leviathans their incalculable seniors i am by a flood borne back to that wondrous period ere time itself can be said to have begun for time began with man here saturns grey chaos rolls over me and i obtain dim shuddering glimpses into those polar eternities when wedged bastions of ice pressed hard upon what are now the tropics and in all the  miles of this worlds circumference not an inhabitable hands breadth of land was visible then the whole world was the whales and king of creation he left his wake along the present lines of the andes and the himmalehs who can show a pedigree like leviathan ahabs harpoon had shed older blood than the pharaohs methuselah seems a schoolboy i look round to shake hands with shem i am horrorstruck at this antemosaic unsourced existence of the unspeakable terrors of the whale which having been before all time must needs exist after all humane ages are over ,MobyDick or The Whale
but not alone has this leviathan left his preadamite traces in the stereotype plates of nature and in limestone and marl bequeathed his ancient bust but upon egyptian tablets whose antiquity seems to claim for them an almost fossiliferous character we find the unmistakable print of his fin in an apartment of the great temple of denderah some fifty years ago there was discovered upon the granite ceiling a sculptured and painted planisphere abounding in centaurs griffins and dolphins similar to the grotesque figures on the celestial globe of the moderns gliding among them old leviathan swam as of yore was there swimming in that planisphere centuries before solomon was cradled ,MobyDick or The Whale
not far from the seaside they have a temple the rafters and beams of which are made of whalebones for whales of a monstrous size are oftentimes cast up dead upon that shore the common people imagine that by a secret power bestowed by god upon the temple no whale can pass it without immediate death but the truth of the matter is that on either side of the temple there are rocks that shoot two miles into the sea and wound the whales when they light upon em they keep a whales rib of an incredible length for a miracle which lying upon the ground with its convex part uppermost makes an arch the head of which cannot be reached by a man upon a camels back this rib says john leo is said to have layn there a hundred years before i saw it their historians affirm that a prophet who prophesyd of mahomet came from this temple and some do not stand to assert that the prophet jonas was cast forth by the whale at the base of the temple ,MobyDick or The Whale
inasmuch then as this leviathan comes floundering down upon us from the headwaters of the eternities it may be fitly inquired whether in the long course of his generations he has not degenerated from the original bulk of his sires ,MobyDick or The Whale
but upon investigation we find that not only are the whales of the present day superior in magnitude to those whose fossil remains are found in the tertiary system embracing a distinct geological period prior to man but of the whales found in that tertiary system those belonging to its latter formations exceed in size those of its earlier ones ,MobyDick or The Whale
of all the preadamite whales yet exhumed by far the largest is the alabama one mentioned in the last chapter and that was less than seventy feet in length in the skeleton whereas we have already seen that the tapemeasure gives seventytwo feet for the skeleton of a large sized modern whale and i have heard on whalemens authority that sperm whales have been captured near a hundred feet long at the time of capture ,MobyDick or The Whale
assuredly we must conclude so if we are to credit the accounts of such gentlemen as pliny and the ancient naturalists generally for pliny tells us of whales that embraced acres of living bulk and aldrovandus of others which measured eight hundred feet in lengthrope walks and thames tunnels of whales and even in the days of banks and solander cookes naturalists we find a danish member of the academy of sciences setting down certain iceland whales reydansiskur or wrinkled bellies at one hundred and twenty yards that is three hundred and sixty feet and lacpde the french naturalist in his elaborate history of whales in the very beginning of his work page  sets down the right whale at one hundred metres three hundred and twentyeight feet and this work was published so late as ad  ,MobyDick or The Whale
but will any whaleman believe these stories no the whale of today is as big as his ancestors in plinys time and if ever i go where pliny is i a whaleman more than he was will make bold to tell him so because i cannot understand how it is that while the egyptian mummies that were buried thousands of years before even pliny was born do not measure so much in their coffins as a modern kentuckian in his socks and while the cattle and other animals sculptured on the oldest egyptian and nineveh tablets by the relative proportions in which they are drawn just as plainly prove that the highbred stallfed prize cattle of smithfield not only equal but far exceed in magnitude the fattest of pharaohs fat kine in the face of all this i will not admit that of all animals the whale alone should have degenerated ,MobyDick or The Whale
but still another inquiry remains one often agitated by the more recondite nantucketers whether owing to the almost omniscient lookouts at the mastheads of the whaleships now penetrating even through behrings straits and into the remotest secret drawers and lockers of the world and the thousand harpoons and lances darted along all continental coasts the moot point is whether leviathan can long endure so wide a chase and so remorseless a havoc whether he must not at last be exterminated from the waters and the last whale like the last man smoke his last pipe and then himself evaporate in the final puff ,MobyDick or The Whale
comparing the humped herds of whales with the humped herds of buffalo which not forty years ago overspread by tens of thousands the prairies of illinois and missouri and shook their iron manes and scowled with their thunderclotted brows upon the sites of populous rivercapitals where now the polite broker sells you land at a dollar an inch in such a comparison an irresistible argument would seem furnished to show that the hunted whale cannot now escape speedy extinction ,MobyDick or The Whale
but you must look at this matter in every light though so short a period agonot a good lifetimethe census of the buffalo in illinois exceeded the census of men now in london and though at the present day not one horn or hoof of them remains in all that region and though the cause of this wondrous extermination was the spear of man yet the far different nature of the whalehunt peremptorily forbids so inglorious an end to the leviathan forty men in one ship hunting the sperm whales for fortyeight months think they have done extremely well and thank god if at last they carry home the oil of forty fish whereas in the days of the old canadian and indian hunters and trappers of the west when the far west in whose sunset suns still rise was a wilderness and a virgin the same number of moccasined men for the same number of months mounted on horse instead of sailing in ships would have slain not forty but forty thousand and more buffaloes a fact that if need were could be statistically stated ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor considered aright does it seem any argument in favour of the gradual extinction of the sperm whale for example that in former years the latter part of the last century say these leviathans in small pods were encountered much oftener than at present and in consequence the voyages were not so prolonged and were also much more remunerative because as has been elsewhere noticed those whales influenced by some views to safety now swim the seas in immense caravans so that to a large degree the scattered solitaries yokes and pods and schools of other days are now aggregated into vast but widely separated unfrequent armies that is all and equally fallacious seems the conceit that because the socalled whalebone whales no longer haunt many grounds in former years abounding with them hence that species also is declining for they are only being driven from promontory to cape and if one coast is no longer enlivened with their jets then be sure some other and remoter strand has been very recently startled by the unfamiliar spectacle ,MobyDick or The Whale
furthermore concerning these last mentioned leviathans they have two firm fortresses which in all human probability will for ever remain impregnable and as upon the invasion of their valleys the frosty swiss have retreated to their mountains so hunted from the savannas and glades of the middle seas the whalebone whales can at last resort to their polar citadels and diving under the ultimate glassy barriers and walls there come up among icy fields and floes and in a charmed circle of everlasting december bid defiance to all pursuit from man ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as perhaps fifty of these whalebone whales are harpooned for one cachalot some philosophers of the forecastle have concluded that this positive havoc has already very seriously diminished their battalions but though for some time past a number of these whales not less than  have been annually slain on the nor west coast by the americans alone yet there are considerations which render even this circumstance of little or no account as an opposing argument in this matter ,MobyDick or The Whale
natural as it is to be somewhat incredulous concerning the populousness of the more enormous creatures of the globe yet what shall we say to harto the historian of goa when he tells us that at one hunting the king of siam took  elephants that in those regions elephants are numerous as droves of cattle in the temperate climes and there seems no reason to doubt that if these elephants which have now been hunted for thousands of years by semiramis by porus by hannibal and by all the successive monarchs of the eastif they still survive there in great numbers much more may the great whale outlast all hunting since he has a pasture to expatiate in which is precisely twice as large as all asia both americas europe and africa new holland and all the isles of the sea combined ,MobyDick or The Whale
moreover we are to consider that from the presumed great longevity of whales their probably attaining the age of a century and more therefore at any one period of time several distinct adult generations must be contemporary and what that is we may soon gain some idea of by imagining all the graveyards cemeteries and family vaults of creation yielding up the live bodies of all the men women and children who were alive seventyfive years ago and adding this countless host to the present human population of the globe ,MobyDick or The Whale
wherefore for all these things we account the whale immortal in his species however perishable in his individuality he swam the seas before the continents broke water he once swam over the site of the tuileries and windsor castle and the kremlin in noahs flood he despised noahs ark and if ever the world is to be again flooded like the netherlands to kill off its rats then the eternal whale will still survive and rearing upon the topmost crest of the equatorial flood spout his frothed defiance to the skies ,MobyDick or The Whale
the precipitating manner in which captain ahab had quitted the samuel enderby of london had not been unattended with some small violence to his own person he had lighted with such energy upon a thwart of his boat that his ivory leg had received a halfsplintering shock and when after gaining his own deck and his own pivothole there he so vehemently wheeled round with an urgent command to the steersman it was as ever something about his not steering inflexibly enough then the already shaken ivory received such an additional twist and wrench that though it still remained entire and to all appearances lusty yet ahab did not deem it entirely trustworthy ,MobyDick or The Whale
and indeed it seemed small matter for wonder that for all his pervading mad recklessness ahab did at times give careful heed to the condition of that dead bone upon which he partly stood for it had not been very long prior to the pequods sailing from nantucket that he had been found one night lying prone upon the ground and insensible by some unknown and seemingly inexplicable unimaginable casualty his ivory limb having been so violently displaced that it had stakewise smitten and all but pierced his groin nor was it without extreme difficulty that the agonizing wound was entirely cured ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor at the time had it failed to enter his monomaniac mind that all the anguish of that then present suffering was but the direct issue of a former woe and he too plainly seemed to see that as the most poisonous reptile of the marsh perpetuates his kind as inevitably as the sweetest songster of the grove so equally with every felicity all miserable events do naturally beget their like yea more than equally thought ahab since both the ancestry and posterity of grief go further than the ancestry and posterity of joy for not to hint of this that it is an inference from certain canonic teachings that while some natural enjoyments here shall have no children born to them for the other world but on the contrary shall be followed by the joychildlessness of all hells despair whereas some guilty mortal miseries shall still fertilely beget to themselves an eternally progressive progeny of griefs beyond the grave not at all to hint of this there still seems an inequality in the deeper analysis of the thing for thought ahab while even the highest earthly felicities ever have a certain unsignifying pettiness lurking in them but at bottom all heartwoes a mystic significance and in some men an archangelic grandeur so do their diligent tracingsout not belie the obvious deduction to trail the genealogies of these high mortal miseries carries us at last among the sourceless primogenitures of the gods so that in the face of all the glad haymaking suns and soft cymballing round harvestmoons we must needs give in to this that the gods themselves are not for ever glad the ineffaceable sad birthmark in the brow of man is but the stamp of sorrow in the signers ,MobyDick or The Whale
unwittingly here a secret has been divulged which perhaps might more properly in set way have been disclosed before with many other particulars concerning ahab always had it remained a mystery to some why it was that for a certain period both before and after the sailing of the pequod he had hidden himself away with such grandlamalike exclusiveness and for that one interval sought speechless refuge as it were among the marble senate of the dead captain pelegs bruited reason for this thing appeared by no means adequate though indeed as touching all ahabs deeper part every revelation partook more of significant darkness than of explanatory light but in the end it all came out this one matter did at least that direful mishap was at the bottom of his temporary recluseness and not only this but to that evercontracting dropping circle ashore who for any reason possessed the privilege of a less banned approach to him to that timid circle the above hinted casualtyremaining as it did moodily unaccounted for by ahabinvested itself with terrors not entirely underived from the land of spirits and of wails so that through their zeal for him they had all conspired so far as in them lay to muffle up the knowledge of this thing from others and hence it was that not till a considerable interval had elapsed did it transpire upon the pequods decks ,MobyDick or The Whale
but be all this as it may let the unseen ambiguous synod in the air or the vindictive princes and potentates of fire have to do or not with earthly ahab yet in this present matter of his leg he took plain practical procedureshe called the carpenter ,MobyDick or The Whale
and when that functionary appeared before him he bade him without delay set about making a new leg and directed the mates to see him supplied with all the studs and joists of jawivory sperm whale which had thus far been accumulated on the voyage in order that a careful selection of the stoutest clearestgrained stuff might be secured this done the carpenter received orders to have the leg completed that night and to provide all the fittings for it independent of those pertaining to the distrusted one in use moreover the ships forge was ordered to be hoisted out of its temporary idleness in the hold and to accelerate the affair the blacksmith was commanded to proceed at once to the forging of whatever iron contrivances might be needed ,MobyDick or The Whale
seat thyself sultanically among the moons of saturn and take high abstracted man alone and he seems a wonder a grandeur and a woe but from the same point take mankind in mass and for the most part they seem a mob of unnecessary duplicates both contemporary and hereditary but most humble though he was and far from furnishing an example of the high humane abstraction the pequods carpenter was no duplicate hence he now comes in person on this stage ,MobyDick or The Whale
like all seagoing ship carpenters and more especially those belonging to whaling vessels he was to a certain offhanded practical extent alike experienced in numerous trades and callings collateral to his own the carpenters pursuit being the ancient and outbranching trunk of all those numerous handicrafts which more or less have to do with wood as an auxiliary material but besides the application to him of the generic remark above this carpenter of the pequod was singularly efficient in those thousand nameless mechanical emergencies continually recurring in a large ship upon a three or four years voyage in uncivilized and fardistant seas for not to speak of his readiness in ordinary dutiesrepairing stove boats sprung spars reforming the shape of clumsybladed oars inserting bulls eyes in the deck or new treenails in the side planks and other miscellaneous matters more directly pertaining to his special business he was moreover unhesitatingly expert in all manner of conflicting aptitudes both useful and capricious ,MobyDick or The Whale
the one grand stage where he enacted all his various parts so manifold was his vicebench a long rude ponderous table furnished with several vices of different sizes and both of iron and of wood at all times except when whales were alongside this bench was securely lashed athwartships against the rear of the tryworks ,MobyDick or The Whale
a belaying pin is found too large to be easily inserted into its hole the carpenter claps it into one of his everready vices and straightway files it smaller a lost landbird of strange plumage strays on board and is made a captive out of clean shaved rods of rightwhale bone and crossbeams of sperm whale ivory the carpenter makes a pagodalooking cage for it an oarsman sprains his wrist the carpenter concocts a soothing lotion stubb longed for vermillion stars to be painted upon the blade of his every oar screwing each oar in his big vice of wood the carpenter symmetrically supplies the constellation a sailor takes a fancy to wear sharkbone earrings the carpenter drills his ears another has the toothache the carpenter out pincers and clapping one hand upon his bench bids him be seated there but the poor fellow unmanageably winces under the unconcluded operation whirling round the handle of his wooden vice the carpenter signs him to clap his jaw in that if he would have him draw the tooth ,MobyDick or The Whale
thus this carpenter was prepared at all points and alike indifferent and without respect in all teeth he accounted bits of ivory heads he deemed but topblocks men themselves he lightly held for capstans but while now upon so wide a field thus variously accomplished and with such liveliness of expertness in him too all this would seem to argue some uncommon vivacity of intelligence but not precisely so for nothing was this man more remarkable than for a certain impersonal stolidity as it were impersonal i say for it so shaded off into the surrounding infinite of things that it seemed one with the general stolidity discernible in the whole visible world which while pauselessly active in uncounted modes still eternally holds its peace and ignores you though you dig foundations for cathedrals yet was this halfhorrible stolidity in him involving too as it appeared an allramifying heartlessnessyet was it oddly dashed at times with an old crutchlike antediluvian wheezing humorousness not unstreaked now and then with a certain grizzled wittiness such as might have served to pass the time during the midnight watch on the bearded forecastle of noahs ark was it that this old carpenter had been a lifelong wanderer whose much rolling to and fro not only had gathered no moss but what is more had rubbed off whatever small outward clingings might have originally pertained to him he was a stript abstract an unfractioned integral uncompromised as a newborn babe living without premeditated reference to this world or the next you might almost say that this strange uncompromisedness in him involved a sort of unintelligence for in his numerous trades he did not seem to work so much by reason or by instinct or simply because he had been tutored to it or by any intermixture of all these even or uneven but merely by a kind of deaf and dumb spontaneous literal process he was a pure manipulator his brain if he had ever had one must have early oozed along into the muscles of his fingers he was like one of those unreasoning but still highly useful multum in parvo sheffield contrivances assuming the exteriorthough a little swelledof a common pocket knife but containing not only blades of various sizes but also screwdrivers corkscrews tweezers awls pens rulers nailfilers countersinkers so if his superiors wanted to use the carpenter for a screwdriver all they had to do was to open that part of him and the screw was fast or if for tweezers take him up by the legs and there they were ,MobyDick or The Whale
yet as previously hinted this omnitooled openandshut carpenter was after all no mere machine of an automaton if he did not have a common soul in him he had a subtle something that somehow anomalously did its duty what that was whether essence of quicksilver or a few drops of hartshorn there is no telling but there it was and there it had abided for now some sixty years or more and this it was this same unaccountable cunning lifeprinciple in him this it was that kept him a great part of the time soliloquizing but only like an unreasoning wheel which also hummingly soliloquizes or rather his body was a sentrybox and this soliloquizer on guard there and talking all the time to keep himself awake ,MobyDick or The Whale
carpenter standing before his vicebench and by the light of two lanterns busily filing the ivory joist for the leg which joist is firmly fixed in the vice slabs of ivory leather straps pads screws and various tools of all sorts lying about the bench forward the red flame of the forge is seen where the blacksmith is at work ,MobyDick or The Whale
drat the file and drat the bone that is hard which should be soft and that is soft which should be hard so we go who file old jaws and shinbones lets try another aye now this works better sneezes halloa this bone dust is sneezeswhy its sneezesyes its sneezesbless my soul it wont let me speak this is what an old fellow gets now for working in dead lumber saw a live tree and you dont get this dust amputate a live bone and you dont get it sneezes come come you old smut there bear a hand and lets have that ferule and bucklescrew ill be ready for them presently lucky now sneezes theres no kneejoint to make that might puzzle a little but a mere shinbonewhy its easy as making hoppoles only i should like to put a good finish on time time if i but only had the time i could turn him out as neat a leg now as ever sneezes scraped to a lady in a parlor those buckskin legs and calves of legs ive seen in shop windows wouldnt compare at all they soak water they do and of course get rheumatic and have to be doctored sneezes with washes and lotions just like live legs there before i saw it off now i must call his old mogulship and see whether the length will be all right too short if anything i guess ha thats the heel we are in luck here he comes or its somebody else thats certain ,MobyDick or The Whale
umm so he must i do deem it now a most meaning thing that that old greek prometheus who made men they say should have been a blacksmith and animated them with fire for whats made in fire must properly belong to fire and so hells probable how the soot flies this must be the remainder the greek made the africans of carpenter when hes through with that buckle tell him to forge a pair of steel shoulderblades theres a pedlar aboard with a crushing pack ,MobyDick or The Whale
hold while prometheus is about it ill order a complete man after a desirable pattern imprimis fifty feet high in his socks then chest modelled after the thames tunnel then legs with roots to em to stay in one place then arms three feet through the wrist no heart at all brass forehead and about a quarter of an acre of fine brains and let me seeshall i order eyes to see outwards no but put a skylight on top of his head to illuminate inwards there take the order and away ,MobyDick or The Whale
look ye carpenter i dare say thou callest thyself a right good workmanlike workman eh well then will it speak thoroughly well for thy work if when i come to mount this leg thou makest i shall nevertheless feel another leg in the same identical place with it that is carpenter my old lost leg the flesh and blood one i mean canst thou not drive that old adam away ,MobyDick or The Whale
truly sir i begin to understand somewhat now yes i have heard something curious on that score sir how that a dismasted man never entirely loses the feeling of his old spar but it will be still pricking him at times may i humbly ask if it be really so sir ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is man look put thy live leg here in the place where mine once was so now here is only one distinct leg to the eye yet two to the soul where thou feelest tingling life there exactly there there to a hair do i ist a riddle ,MobyDick or The Whale
hist then how dost thou know that some entire living thinking thing may not be invisibly and uninterpenetratingly standing precisely where thou now standest aye and standing there in thy spite in thy most solitary hours then dost thou not fear eavesdroppers hold dont speak and if i still feel the smart of my crushed leg though it be now so long dissolved then why mayst not thou carpenter feel the fiery pains of hell for ever and without a body hah ,MobyDick or The Whale
bungle away at it then and bring it to me turns to go oh life here i am proud as greek god and yet standing debtor to this blockhead for a bone to stand on cursed be that mortal interindebtedness which will not do away with ledgers i would be free as air and im down in the whole worlds books i am so rich i could have given bid for bid with the wealthiest prtorians at the auction of the roman empire which was the worlds and yet i owe for the flesh in the tongue i brag with by heavens ill get a crucible and into it and dissolve myself down to one small compendious vertebra so ,MobyDick or The Whale
well well well stubb knows him best of all and stubb always says hes queer says nothing but that one sufficient little word queer hes queer says stubb hes queerqueer queer and keeps dinning it into mr starbuck all the timequeersirqueer queer very queer and heres his leg yes now that i think of it heres his bedfellow has a stick of whales jawbone for a wife and this is his leg hell stand on this what was that now about one leg standing in three places and all three places standing in one hellhow was that oh i dont wonder he looked so scornful at me im a sort of strangethoughted sometimes they say but thats only haphazardlike then a short little old body like me should never undertake to wade out into deep waters with tall heronbuilt captains the water chucks you under the chin pretty quick and theres a great cry for lifeboats and heres the herons leg long and slim sure enough now for most folks one pair of legs lasts a lifetime and that must be because they use them mercifully as a tenderhearted old lady uses her rolypoly old coachhorses but ahab oh hes a hard driver look driven one leg to death and spavined the other for life and now wears out bone legs by the cord halloa there you smut bear a hand there with those screws and lets finish it before the resurrection fellow comes acalling with his horn for all legs true or false as brewerymen go round collecting old beer barrels to fill em up again what a leg this is it looks like a real live leg filed down to nothing but the core hell be standing on this tomorrow hell be taking altitudes on it halloa i almost forgot the little oval slate smoothed ivory where he figures up the latitude so so chisel file and sandpaper now ,MobyDick or The Whale
according to usage they were pumping the ship next morning and lo no inconsiderable oil came up with the water the casks below must have sprung a bad leak much concern was shown and starbuck went down into the cabin to report this unfavourable affair ,MobyDick or The Whale
in spermwhalemen with any considerable quantity of oil on board it is a regular semiweekly duty to conduct a hose into the hold and drench the casks with seawater which afterwards at varying intervals is removed by the ships pumps hereby the casks are sought to be kept damply tight while by the changed character of the withdrawn water the mariners readily detect any serious leakage in the precious cargo ,MobyDick or The Whale
now from the south and west the pequod was drawing nigh to formosa and the bashee isles between which lies one of the tropical outlets from the china waters into the pacific and so starbuck found ahab with a general chart of the oriental archipelagoes spread before him and another separate one representing the long eastern coasts of the japanese islandsniphon matsmai and sikoke with his snowwhite new ivory leg braced against the screwed leg of his table and with a long pruninghook of a jackknife in his hand the wondrous old man with his back to the gangway door was wrinkling his brow and tracing his old courses again ,MobyDick or The Whale
and i was not speaking or thinking of that at all begone let it leak im all aleak myself aye leaks in leaks not only full of leaky casks but those leaky casks are in a leaky ship and thats a far worse plight than the pequods man yet i dont stop to plug my leak for who can find it in the deeploaded hull or how hope to plug it even if found in this lifes howling gale starbuck ill not have the burtons hoisted ,MobyDick or The Whale
let the owners stand on nantucket beach and outyell the typhoons what cares ahab owners owners thou art always prating to me starbuck about those miserly owners as if the owners were my conscience but look ye the only real owner of anything is its commander and hark ye my conscience is in this ships keelon deck ,MobyDick or The Whale
captain ahab said the reddening mate moving further into the cabin with a daring so strangely respectful and cautious that it almost seemed not only every way seeking to avoid the slightest outward manifestation of itself but within also seemed more than half distrustful of itself a better man than i might well pass over in thee what he would quickly enough resent in a younger man aye and in a happier captain ahab ,MobyDick or The Whale
ahab seized a loaded musket from the rack forming part of most southseamens cabin furniture and pointing it towards starbuck exclaimed there is one god that is lord over the earth and one captain that is lord over the pequodon deck ,MobyDick or The Whale
for an instant in the flashing eyes of the mate and his fiery cheeks you would have almost thought that he had really received the blaze of the levelled tube but mastering his emotion he half calmly rose and as he quitted the cabin paused for an instant and said thou hast outraged not insulted me sir but for that i ask thee not to beware of starbuck thou wouldst but laugh but let ahab beware of ahab beware of thyself old man ,MobyDick or The Whale
he waxes brave but nevertheless obeys most careful bravery that murmured ahab as starbuck disappeared whats that he saidahab beware of ahabtheres something there then unconsciously using the musket for a staff with an iron brow he paced to and fro in the little cabin but presently the thick plaits of his forehead relaxed and returning the gun to the rack he went to the deck ,MobyDick or The Whale
thou art but too good a fellow starbuck he said lowly to the mate then raising his voice to the crew furl the tgallantsails and closereef the topsails fore and aft back the mainyard up burton and break out in the mainhold ,MobyDick or The Whale
it were perhaps vain to surmise exactly why it was that as respecting starbuck ahab thus acted it may have been a flash of honesty in him or mere prudential policy which under the circumstance imperiously forbade the slightest symptom of open disaffection however transient in the important chief officer of his ship however it was his orders were executed and the burtons were hoisted ,MobyDick or The Whale
upon searching it was found that the casks last struck into the hold were perfectly sound and that the leak must be further off so it being calm weather they broke out deeper and deeper disturbing the slumbers of the huge groundtier butts and from that black midnight sending those gigantic moles into the daylight above so deep did they go and so ancient and corroded and weedy the aspect of the lowermost puncheons that you almost looked next for some mouldy cornerstone cask containing coins of captain noah with copies of the posted placards vainly warning the infatuated old world from the flood tierce after tierce too of water and bread and beef and shooks of staves and iron bundles of hoops were hoisted out till at last the piled decks were hard to get about and the hollow hull echoed under foot as if you were treading over empty catacombs and reeled and rolled in the sea like an airfreighted demijohn topheavy was the ship as a dinnerless student with all aristotle in his head well was it that the typhoons did not visit them then ,MobyDick or The Whale
be it said that in this vocation of whaling sinecures are unknown dignity and danger go hand in hand till you get to be captain the higher you rise the harder you toil so with poor queequeg who as harpooneer must not only face all the rage of the living whale butas we have elsewhere seenmount his dead back in a rolling sea and finally descend into the gloom of the hold and bitterly sweating all day in that subterraneous confinement resolutely manhandle the clumsiest casks and see to their stowage to be short among whalemen the harpooneers are the holders so called ,MobyDick or The Whale
poor queequeg when the ship was about half disembowelled you should have stooped over the hatchway and peered down upon him there where stripped to his woollen drawers the tattooed savage was crawling about amid that dampness and slime like a green spotted lizard at the bottom of a well and a well or an icehouse it somehow proved to him poor pagan where strange to say for all the heat of his sweatings he caught a terrible chill which lapsed into a fever and at last after some days suffering laid him in his hammock close to the very sill of the door of death how he wasted and wasted away in those few longlingering days till there seemed but little left of him but his frame and tattooing but as all else in him thinned and his cheekbones grew sharper his eyes nevertheless seemed growing fuller and fuller they became of a strange softness of lustre and mildly but deeply looked out at you there from his sickness a wondrous testimony to that immortal health in him which could not die or be weakened and like circles on the water which as they grow fainter expand so his eyes seemed rounding and rounding like the rings of eternity an awe that cannot be named would steal over you as you sat by the side of this waning savage and saw as strange things in his face as any beheld who were bystanders when zoroaster died for whatever is truly wondrous and fearful in man never yet was put into words or books and the drawing near of death which alike levels all alike impresses all with a last revelation which only an author from the dead could adequately tell so thatlet us say it againno dying chaldee or greek had higher and holier thoughts than those whose mysterious shades you saw creeping over the face of poor queequeg as he quietly lay in his swaying hammock and the rolling sea seemed gently rocking him to his final rest and the oceans invisible floodtide lifted him higher and higher towards his destined heaven ,MobyDick or The Whale
not a man of the crew but gave him up and as for queequeg himself what he thought of his case was forcibly shown by a curious favour he asked he called one to him in the grey morning watch when the day was just breaking and taking his hand said that while in nantucket he had chanced to see certain little canoes of dark wood like the rich warwood of his native isle and upon inquiry he had learned that all whalemen who died in nantucket were laid in those same dark canoes and that the fancy of being so laid had much pleased him for it was not unlike the custom of his own race who after embalming a dead warrior stretched him out in his canoe and so left him to be floated away to the starry archipelagoes for not only do they believe that the stars are isles but that far beyond all visible horizons their own mild uncontinented seas interflow with the blue heavens and so form the white breakers of the milky way he added that he shuddered at the thought of being buried in his hammock according to the usual seacustom tossed like something vile to the deathdevouring sharks no he desired a canoe like those of nantucket all the more congenial to him being a whaleman that like a whaleboat these coffincanoes were without a keel though that involved but uncertain steering and much leeway adown the dim ages ,MobyDick or The Whale
now when this strange circumstance was made known aft the carpenter was at once commanded to do queequegs bidding whatever it might include there was some heathenish coffincoloured old lumber aboard which upon a long previous voyage had been cut from the aboriginal groves of the lackaday islands and from these dark planks the coffin was recommended to be made no sooner was the carpenter apprised of the order than taking his rule he forthwith with all the indifferent promptitude of his character proceeded into the forecastle and took queequegs measure with great accuracy regularly chalking queequegs person as he shifted the rule ,MobyDick or The Whale
going to his vicebench the carpenter for convenience sake and general reference now transferringly measured on it the exact length the coffin was to be and then made the transfer permanent by cutting two notches at its extremities this done he marshalled the planks and his tools and to work ,MobyDick or The Whale
overhearing the indignant but halfhumorous cries with which the people on deck began to drive the coffin away queequeg to every ones consternation commanded that the thing should be instantly brought to him nor was there any denying him seeing that of all mortals some dying men are the most tyrannical and certainly since they will shortly trouble us so little for evermore the poor fellows ought to be indulged ,MobyDick or The Whale
leaning over in his hammock queequeg long regarded the coffin with an attentive eye he then called for his harpoon had the wooden stock drawn from it and then had the iron part placed in the coffin along with one of the paddles of his boat all by his own request also biscuits were then ranged round the sides within a flask of fresh water was placed at the head and a small bag of woody earth scraped up in the hold at the foot and a piece of sailcloth being rolled up for a pillow queequeg now entreated to be lifted into his final bed that he might make trial of its comforts if any it had he lay without moving a few minutes then told one to go to his bag and bring out his little god yojo then crossing his arms on his breast with yojo between he called for the coffin lid hatch he called it to be placed over him the head part turned over with a leather hinge and there lay queequeg in his coffin with little but his composed countenance in view rarmai it will do it is easy he murmured at last and signed to be replaced in his hammock ,MobyDick or The Whale
poor rover will ye never have done with all this weary roving where go ye now but if the currents carry ye to those sweet antilles where the beaches are only beat with waterlilies will ye do one little errand for me seek out one pip whos now been missing long i think hes in those far antilles if ye find him then comfort him for he must be very sad for look hes left his tambourine behindi found it rigadig dig dig now queequeg die and ill beat ye your dying march ,MobyDick or The Whale
i have heard murmured starbuck gazing down the scuttle that in violent fevers men all ignorance have talked in ancient tongues and that when the mystery is probed it turns out always that in their wholly forgotten childhood those ancient tongues had been really spoken in their hearing by some lofty scholars so to my fond faith poor pip in this strange sweetness of his lunacy brings heavenly vouchers of all our heavenly homes where learned he that but therehark he speaks again but more wildly now ,MobyDick or The Whale
form two and two lets make a general of him ho wheres his harpoon lay it across hererigadig dig dig huzza oh for a game cock now to sit upon his head and crow queequeg dies gamemind ye that queequeg dies gametake ye good heed of that queequeg dies game i say game game game but base little pip he died a coward died all ashiverout upon pip hark ye if ye find pip tell all the antilles hes a runaway a coward a coward a coward tell them he jumped from a whaleboat id never beat my tambourine over base pip and hail him general if he were once more dying here no no shame upon all cowardsshame upon them let em go drown like pip that jumped from a whaleboat shame shame ,MobyDick or The Whale
but now that he had apparently made every preparation for death now that his coffin was proved a good fit queequeg suddenly rallied soon there seemed no need of the carpenters box and thereupon when some expressed their delighted surprise he in substance said that the cause of his sudden convalescence was thisat a critical moment he had just recalled a little duty ashore which he was leaving undone and therefore had changed his mind about dying he could not die yet he averred they asked him then whether to live or die was a matter of his own sovereign will and pleasure he answered certainly in a word it was queequegs conceit that if a man made up his mind to live mere sickness could not kill him nothing but a whale or a gale or some violent ungovernable unintelligent destroyer of that sort ,MobyDick or The Whale
now there is this noteworthy difference between savage and civilized that while a sick civilized man may be six months convalescing generally speaking a sick savage is almost halfwell again in a day so in good time my queequeg gained strength and at length after sitting on the windlass for a few indolent days but eating with a vigorous appetite he suddenly leaped to his feet threw out his arms and legs gave himself a good stretching yawned a little bit and then springing into the head of his hoisted boat and poising a harpoon pronounced himself fit for a fight ,MobyDick or The Whale
with a wild whimsiness he now used his coffin for a seachest and emptying into it his canvas bag of clothes set them in order there many spare hours he spent in carving the lid with all manner of grotesque figures and drawings and it seemed that hereby he was striving in his rude way to copy parts of the twisted tattooing on his body and this tattooing had been the work of a departed prophet and seer of his island who by those hieroglyphic marks had written out on his body a complete theory of the heavens and the earth and a mystical treatise on the art of attaining truth so that queequeg in his own proper person was a riddle to unfold a wondrous work in one volume but whose mysteries not even himself could read though his own live heart beat against them and these mysteries were therefore destined in the end to moulder away with the living parchment whereon they were inscribed and so be unsolved to the last and this thought it must have been which suggested to ahab that wild exclamation of his when one morning turning away from surveying poor queequegoh devilish tantalization of the gods ,MobyDick or The Whale
when gliding by the bashee isles we emerged at last upon the great south sea were it not for other things i could have greeted my dear pacific with uncounted thanks for now the long supplication of my youth was answered that serene ocean rolled eastwards from me a thousand leagues of blue ,MobyDick or The Whale
there is one knows not what sweet mystery about this sea whose gently awful stirrings seem to speak of some hidden soul beneath like those fabled undulations of the ephesian sod over the buried evangelist st john and meet it is that over these seapastures widerolling watery prairies and potters fields of all four continents the waves should rise and fall and ebb and flow unceasingly for here millions of mixed shades and shadows drowned dreams somnambulisms reveries all that we call lives and souls lie dreaming dreaming still tossing like slumberers in their beds the everrolling waves but made so by their restlessness ,MobyDick or The Whale
to any meditative magian rover this serene pacific once beheld must ever after be the sea of his adoption it rolls the midmost waters of the world the indian ocean and atlantic being but its arms the same waves wash the moles of the newbuilt californian towns but yesterday planted by the recentest race of men and lave the faded but still gorgeous skirts of asiatic lands older than abraham while all between float milkyways of coral isles and lowlying endless unknown archipelagoes and impenetrable japans thus this mysterious divine pacific zones the worlds whole bulk about makes all coasts one bay to it seems the tidebeating heart of earth lifted by those eternal swells you needs must own the seductive god bowing your head to pan ,MobyDick or The Whale
but few thoughts of pan stirred ahabs brain as standing like an iron statue at his accustomed place beside the mizen rigging with one nostril he unthinkingly snuffed the sugary musk from the bashee isles in whose sweet woods mild lovers must be walking and with the other consciously inhaled the salt breath of the new found sea that sea in which the hated white whale must even then be swimming launched at length upon these almost final waters and gliding towards the japanese cruisingground the old mans purpose intensified itself his firm lips met like the lips of a vice the delta of his foreheads veins swelled like overladen brooks in his very sleep his ringing cry ran through the vaulted hull stern all the white whale spouts thick blood ,MobyDick or The Whale
availing himself of the mild summercool weather that now reigned in these latitudes and in preparation for the peculiarly active pursuits shortly to be anticipated perth the begrimed blistered old blacksmith had not removed his portable forge to the hold again after concluding his contributory work for ahabs leg but still retained it on deck fast lashed to ringbolts by the foremast being now almost incessantly invoked by the headsmen and harpooneers and bowsmen to do some little job for them altering or repairing or new shaping their various weapons and boat furniture often he would be surrounded by an eager circle all waiting to be served holding boatspades pikeheads harpoons and lances and jealously watching his every sooty movement as he toiled nevertheless this old mans was a patient hammer wielded by a patient arm no murmur no impatience no petulance did come from him silent slow and solemn bowing over still further his chronically broken back he toiled away as if toil were life itself and the heavy beating of his hammer the heavy beating of his heart and so it wasmost miserable ,MobyDick or The Whale
a peculiar walk in this old man a certain slight but painful appearing yawing in his gait had at an early period of the voyage excited the curiosity of the mariners and to the importunity of their persisted questionings he had finally given in and so it came to pass that every one now knew the shameful story of his wretched fate ,MobyDick or The Whale
belated and not innocently one bitter winters midnight on the road running between two country towns the blacksmith halfstupidly felt the deadly numbness stealing over him and sought refuge in a leaning dilapidated barn the issue was the loss of the extremities of both feet out of this revelation part by part at last came out the four acts of the gladness and the one long and as yet uncatastrophied fifth act of the grief of his lifes drama ,MobyDick or The Whale
he was an old man who at the age of nearly sixty had postponedly encountered that thing in sorrows technicals called ruin he had been an artisan of famed excellence and with plenty to do owned a house and garden embraced a youthful daughterlike loving wife and three blithe ruddy children every sunday went to a cheerfullooking church planted in a grove but one night under cover of darkness and further concealed in a most cunning disguisement a desperate burglar slid into his happy home and robbed them all of everything and darker yet to tell the blacksmith himself did ignorantly conduct this burglar into his familys heart it was the bottle conjuror upon the opening of that fatal cork forth flew the fiend and shrivelled up his home now for prudent most wise and economic reasons the blacksmiths shop was in the basement of his dwelling but with a separate entrance to it so that always had the young and loving healthy wife listened with no unhappy nervousness but with vigorous pleasure to the stout ringing of her youngarmed old husbands hammer whose reverberations muffled by passing through the floors and walls came up to her not unsweetly in her nursery and so to stout labors iron lullaby the blacksmiths infants were rocked to slumber ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh woe on woe oh death why canst thou not sometimes be timely hadst thou taken this old blacksmith to thyself ere his full ruin came upon him then had the young widow had a delicious grief and her orphans a truly venerable legendary sire to dream of in their after years and all of them a carekilling competency but death plucked down some virtuous elder brother on whose whistling daily toil solely hung the responsibilities of some other family and left the worse than useless old man standing till the hideous rot of life should make him easier to harvest ,MobyDick or The Whale
why tell the whole the blows of the basement hammer every day grew more and more between and each blow every day grew fainter than the last the wife sat frozen at the window with tearless eyes glitteringly gazing into the weeping faces of her children the bellows fell the forge choked up with cinders the house was sold the mother dived down into the long churchyard grass her children twice followed her thither and the houseless familyless old man staggered off a vagabond in crape his every woe unreverenced his grey head a scorn to flaxen curls ,MobyDick or The Whale
death seems the only desirable sequel for a career like this but death is only a launching into the region of the strange untried it is but the first salutation to the possibilities of the immense remote the wild the watery the unshored therefore to the deathlonging eyes of such men who still have left in them some interior compunctions against suicide does the allcontributed and allreceptive ocean alluringly spread forth his whole plain of unimaginable taking terrors and wonderful newlife adventures and from the hearts of infinite pacifics the thousand mermaids sing to themcome hither brokenhearted here is another life without the guilt of intermediate death here are wonders supernatural without dying for them come hither bury thyself in a life which to your now equally abhorred and abhorring landed world is more oblivious than death come hither put up thy gravestone too within the churchyard and come hither till we marry thee ,MobyDick or The Whale
with matted beard and swathed in a bristling sharkskin apron about midday perth was standing between his forge and anvil the latter placed upon an ironwood log with one hand holding a pikehead in the coals and with the other at his forges lungs when captain ahab came along carrying in his hand a small rustylooking leathern bag while yet a little distance from the forge moody ahab paused till at last perth withdrawing his iron from the fire began hammering it upon the anvilthe red mass sending off the sparks in thick hovering flights some of which flew close to ahab ,MobyDick or The Whale
well well no more thy shrunk voice sounds too calmly sanely woeful to me in no paradise myself i am impatient of all misery in others that is not mad thou shouldst go mad blacksmith say why dost thou not go mad how canst thou endure without being mad do the heavens yet hate thee that thou canst not go madwhat wert thou making there ,MobyDick or The Whale
look ye here then cried ahab passionately advancing and leaning with both hands on perths shoulders look ye hereherecan ye smoothe out a seam like this blacksmith sweeping one hand across his ribbed brow if thou couldst blacksmith glad enough would i lay my head upon thy anvil and feel thy heaviest hammer between my eyes answer canst thou smoothe this seam ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye blacksmith it is the one aye man it is unsmoothable for though thou only seest it here in my flesh it has worked down into the bone of my skullthat is all wrinkles but away with childs play no more gaffs and pikes today look ye here jingling the leathern bag as if it were full of gold coins i too want a harpoon made one that a thousand yoke of fiends could not part perth something that will stick in a whale like his own finbone theres the stuff flinging the pouch upon the anvil look ye blacksmith these are the gathered nailstubbs of the steel shoes of racing horses ,MobyDick or The Whale
i know it old man these stubbs will weld together like glue from the melted bones of murderers quick forge me the harpoon and forge me first twelve rods for its shank then wind and twist and hammer these twelve together like the yarns and strands of a towline quick ill blow the fire ,MobyDick or The Whale
this done perth was about to begin welding the twelve into one when ahab stayed his hand and said he would weld his own iron as then with regular gasping hems he hammered on the anvil perth passing to him the glowing rods one after the other and the hard pressed forge shooting up its intense straight flame the parsee passed silently and bowing over his head towards the fire seemed invoking some curse or some blessing on the toil but as ahab looked up he slid aside ,MobyDick or The Whale
fashioned at last into an arrowy shape and welded by perth to the shank the steel soon pointed the end of the iron and as the blacksmith was about giving the barbs their final heat prior to tempering them he cried to ahab to place the watercask near ,MobyDick or The Whale
no nono water for that i want it of the true deathtemper ahoy there tashtego queequeg daggoo what say ye pagans will ye give me as much blood as will cover this barb holding it high up a cluster of dark nods replied yes three punctures were made in the heathen flesh and the white whales barbs were then tempered ,MobyDick or The Whale
now mustering the spare poles from below and selecting one of hickory with the bark still investing it ahab fitted the end to the socket of the iron a coil of new towline was then unwound and some fathoms of it taken to the windlass and stretched to a great tension pressing his foot upon it till the rope hummed like a harpstring then eagerly bending over it and seeing no strandings ahab exclaimed good and now for the seizings ,MobyDick or The Whale
at one extremity the rope was unstranded and the separate spread yarns were all braided and woven round the socket of the harpoon the pole was then driven hard up into the socket from the lower end the rope was traced halfway along the poles length and firmly secured so with intertwistings of twine this done pole iron and ropelike the three fatesremained inseparable and ahab moodily stalked away with the weapon the sound of his ivory leg and the sound of the hickory pole both hollowly ringing along every plank but ere he entered his cabin light unnatural halfbantering yet most piteous sound was heard oh pip thy wretched laugh thy idle but unresting eye all thy strange mummeries not unmeaningly blended with the black tragedy of the melancholy ship and mocked it ,MobyDick or The Whale
penetrating further and further into the heart of the japanese cruising ground the pequod was soon all astir in the fishery often in mild pleasant weather for twelve fifteen eighteen and twenty hours on the stretch they were engaged in the boats steadily pulling or sailing or paddling after the whales or for an interlude of sixty or seventy minutes calmly awaiting their uprising though with but small success for their pains ,MobyDick or The Whale
at such times under an abated sun afloat all day upon smooth slow heaving swells seated in his boat light as a birch canoe and so sociably mixing with the soft waves themselves that like hearthstone cats they purr against the gunwale these are the times of dreamy quietude when beholding the tranquil beauty and brilliancy of the oceans skin one forgets the tiger heart that pants beneath it and would not willingly remember that this velvet paw but conceals a remorseless fang ,MobyDick or The Whale
these are the times when in his whaleboat the rover softly feels a certain filial confident landlike feeling towards the sea that he regards it as so much flowery earth and the distant ship revealing only the tops of her masts seems struggling forward not through high rolling waves but through the tall grass of a rolling prairie as when the western emigrants horses only show their erected ears while their hidden bodies widely wade through the amazing verdure ,MobyDick or The Whale
the longdrawn virgin vales the mild blue hillsides as over these there steals the hush the hum you almost swear that playwearied children lie sleeping in these solitudes in some glad maytime when the flowers of the woods are plucked and all this mixes with your most mystic mood so that fact and fancy halfway meeting interpenetrate and form one seamless whole ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor did such soothing scenes however temporary fail of at least as temporary an effect on ahab but if these secret golden keys did seem to open in him his own secret golden treasuries yet did his breath upon them prove but tarnishing ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh grassy glades oh ever vernal endless landscapes in the soul in yethough long parched by the dead drought of the earthy lifein ye men yet may roll like young horses in new morning clover and for some few fleeting moments feel the cool dew of the life immortal on them would to god these blessed calms would last but the mingled mingling threads of life are woven by warp and woof calms crossed by storms a storm for every calm there is no steady unretracing progress in this life we do not advance through fixed gradations and at the last one pausethrough infancys unconscious spell boyhoods thoughtless faith adolescence doubt the common doom then scepticism then disbelief resting at last in manhoods pondering repose of if but once gone through we trace the round again and are infants boys and men and ifs eternally where lies the final harbor whence we unmoor no more in what rapt ether sails the world of which the weariest will never weary where is the foundlings father hidden our souls are like those orphans whose unwedded mothers die in bearing them the secret of our paternity lies in their grave and we must there to learn it ,MobyDick or The Whale
loveliness unfathomable as ever lover saw in his young brides eyetell me not of thy teethtiered sharks and thy kidnapping cannibal ways let faith oust fact let fancy oust memory i look deep down and do believe ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a nantucket ship the bachelor which had just wedged in her last cask of oil and bolted down her bursting hatches and now in glad holiday apparel was joyously though somewhat vaingloriously sailing round among the widelyseparated ships on the ground previous to pointing her prow for home ,MobyDick or The Whale
the three men at her masthead wore long streamers of narrow red bunting at their hats from the stern a whaleboat was suspended bottom down and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw of the last whale they had slain signals ensigns and jacks of all colours were flying from her rigging on every side sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm above which in her topmast crosstrees you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp ,MobyDick or The Whale
as was afterwards learned the bachelor had met with the most surprising success all the more wonderful for that while cruising in the same seas numerous other vessels had gone entire months without securing a single fish not only had barrels of beef and bread been given away to make room for the far more valuable sperm but additional supplemental casks had been bartered for from the ships she had met and these were stowed along the deck and in the captains and officers staterooms even the cabin table itself had been knocked into kindlingwood and the cabin mess dined off the broad head of an oilbutt lashed down to the floor for a centrepiece in the forecastle the sailors had actually caulked and pitched their chests and filled them it was humorously added that the cook had clapped a head on his largest boiler and filled it that the steward had plugged his spare coffeepot and filled it that the harpooneers had headed the sockets of their irons and filled them that indeed everything was filled with sperm except the captains pantaloons pockets and those he reserved to thrust his hands into in selfcomplacent testimony of his entire satisfaction ,MobyDick or The Whale
as this glad ship of good luck bore down upon the moody pequod the barbarian sound of enormous drums came from her forecastle and drawing still nearer a crowd of her men were seen standing round her huge trypots which covered with the parchmentlike poke or stomach skin of the black fish gave forth a loud roar to every stroke of the clenched hands of the crew on the quarterdeck the mates and harpooneers were dancing with the olivehued girls who had eloped with them from the polynesian isles while suspended in an ornamented boat firmly secured aloft between the foremast and mainmast three long island negroes with glittering fiddlebows of whale ivory were presiding over the hilarious jig meanwhile others of the ships company were tumultuously busy at the masonry of the tryworks from which the huge pots had been removed you would have almost thought they were pulling down the cursed bastille such wild cries they raised as the now useless brick and mortar were being hurled into the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
lord and master over all this scene the captain stood erect on the ships elevated quarterdeck so that the whole rejoicing drama was full before him and seemed merely contrived for his own individual diversion ,MobyDick or The Whale
and ahab he too was standing on his quarterdeck shaggy and black with a stubborn gloom and as the two ships crossed each others wakesone all jubilations for things passed the other all forebodings as to things to cometheir two captains in themselves impersonated the whole striking contrast of the scene ,MobyDick or The Whale
how wondrous familiar is a fool muttered ahab then aloud thou art a full ship and homeward bound thou sayst well then call me an empty ship and outwardbound so go thy ways and i will mine forward there set all sail and keep her to the wind ,MobyDick or The Whale
and thus while the one ship went cheerily before the breeze the other stubbornly fought against it and so the two vessels parted the crew of the pequod looking with grave lingering glances towards the receding bachelor but the bachelors men never heeding their gaze for the lively revelry they were in and as ahab leaning over the taffrail eyed the homewardbound craft he took from his pocket a small vial of sand and then looking from the ship to the vial seemed thereby bringing two remote associations together for that vial was filled with nantucket soundings ,MobyDick or The Whale
not seldom in this life when on the right side fortunes favourites sail close by us we though all adroop before catch somewhat of the rushing breeze and joyfully feel our bagging sails fill out so seemed it with the pequod for next day after encountering the gay bachelor whales were seen and four were slain and one of them by ahab ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was far down the afternoon and when all the spearings of the crimson fight were done and floating in the lovely sunset sea and sky sun and whale both stilly died together then such a sweetness and such plaintiveness such inwreathing orisons curled up in that rosy air that it almost seemed as if far over from the deep green convent valleys of the manilla isles the spanish landbreeze wantonly turned sailor had gone to sea freighted with these vesper hymns ,MobyDick or The Whale
soothed again but only soothed to deeper gloom ahab who had sterned off from the whale sat intently watching his final wanings from the now tranquil boat for that strange spectacle observable in all sperm whales dyingthe turning sunwards of the head and so expiringthat strange spectacle beheld of such a placid evening somehow to ahab conveyed a wondrousness unknown before ,MobyDick or The Whale
he turns and turns him to ithow slowly but how steadfastly his homagerendering and invoking brow with his last dying motions he too worships fire most faithful broad baronial vassal of the sunoh that these toofavouring eyes should see these toofavouring sights look here far waterlocked beyond all hum of human weal or woe in these most candid and impartial seas where to traditions no rocks furnish tablets where for long chinese ages the billows have still rolled on speechless and unspoken to as stars that shine upon the nigers unknown source here too life dies sunwards full of faith but see no sooner dead than death whirls round the corpse and it heads some other way ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh thou dark hindoo half of nature who of drowned bones hast builded thy separate throne somewhere in the heart of these unverdured seas thou art an infidel thou queen and too truly speakest to me in the wideslaughtering typhoon and the hushed burial of its after calm nor has this thy whale sunwards turned his dying head and then gone round again without a lesson to me ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh trebly hooped and welded hip of power oh high aspiring rainbowed jetthat one strivest this one jettest all in vain in vain oh whale dost thou seek intercedings with yon allquickening sun that only calls forth life but gives it not again yet dost thou darker half rock me with a prouder if a darker faith all thy unnamable imminglings float beneath me here i am buoyed by breaths of once living things exhaled as air but water now ,MobyDick or The Whale
the four whales slain that evening had died wide apart one far to windward one less distant to leeward one ahead one astern these last three were brought alongside ere nightfall but the windward one could not be reached till morning and the boat that had killed it lay by its side all night and that boat was ahabs ,MobyDick or The Whale
the waifpole was thrust upright into the dead whales spouthole and the lantern hanging from its top cast a troubled flickering glare upon the black glossy back and far out upon the midnight waves which gently chafed the whales broad flank like soft surf upon a beach ,MobyDick or The Whale
ahab and all his boats crew seemed asleep but the parsee who crouching in the bow sat watching the sharks that spectrally played round the whale and tapped the light cedar planks with their tails a sound like the moaning in squadrons over asphaltites of unforgiven ghosts of gomorrah ran shuddering through the air ,MobyDick or The Whale
but i said old man that ere thou couldst die on this voyage two hearses must verily be seen by thee on the sea the first not made by mortal hands and the visible wood of the last one must be grown in america ,MobyDick or The Whale
and when thou art so gone beforeif that ever befallthen ere i can follow thou must still appear to me to pilot me stillwas it not so well then did i believe all ye say oh my pilot i have here two pledges that i shall yet slay moby dick and survive it ,MobyDick or The Whale
the season for the line at length drew near and every day when ahab coming from his cabin cast his eyes aloft the vigilant helmsman would ostentatiously handle his spokes and the eager mariners quickly run to the braces and would stand there with all their eyes centrally fixed on the nailed doubloon impatient for the order to point the ships prow for the equator in good time the order came it was hard upon high noon and ahab seated in the bows of his highhoisted boat was about taking his wonted daily observation of the sun to determine his latitude ,MobyDick or The Whale
now in that japanese sea the days in summer are as freshets of effulgences that unblinkingly vivid japanese sun seems the blazing focus of the glassy oceans immeasurable burningglass the sky looks lacquered clouds there are none the horizon floats and this nakedness of unrelieved radiance is as the insufferable splendors of gods throne well that ahabs quadrant was furnished with coloured glasses through which to take sight of that solar fire so swinging his seated form to the roll of the ship and with his astrologicallooking instrument placed to his eye he remained in that posture for some moments to catch the precise instant when the sun should gain its precise meridian meantime while his whole attention was absorbed the parsee was kneeling beneath him on the ships deck and with face thrown up like ahabs was eyeing the same sun with him only the lids of his eyes half hooded their orbs and his wild face was subdued to an earthly passionlessness at length the desired observation was taken and with his pencil upon his ivory leg ahab soon calculated what his latitude must be at that precise instant then falling into a moments revery he again looked up towards the sun and murmured to himself thou seamark thou high and mighty pilot thou tellest me truly where i ambut canst thou cast the least hint where i shall be or canst thou tell where some other thing besides me is this moment living where is moby dick this instant thou must be eyeing him these eyes of mine look into the very eye that is even now beholding him aye and into the eye that is even now equally beholding the objects on the unknown thither side of thee thou sun ,MobyDick or The Whale
then gazing at his quadrant and handling one after the other its numerous cabalistical contrivances he pondered again and muttered foolish toy babies plaything of haughty admirals and commodores and captains the world brags of thee of thy cunning and might but what after all canst thou do but tell the poor pitiful point where thou thyself happenest to be on this wide planet and the hand that holds thee no not one jot more thou canst not tell where one drop of water or one grain of sand will be tomorrow noon and yet with thy impotence thou insultest the sun science curse thee thou vain toy and cursed be all the things that cast mans eyes aloft to that heaven whose live vividness but scorches him as these old eyes are even now scorched with thy light o sun level by nature to this earths horizon are the glances of mans eyes not shot from the crown of his head as if god had meant him to gaze on his firmament curse thee thou quadrant dashing it to the deck no longer will i guide my earthly way by thee the level ships compass and the level deadreckoning by log and by line these shall conduct me and show me my place on the sea aye lighting from the boat to the deck thus i trample on thee thou paltry thing that feebly pointest on high thus i split and destroy thee ,MobyDick or The Whale
as the frantic old man thus spoke and thus trampled with his live and dead feet a sneering triumph that seemed meant for ahab and a fatalistic despair that seemed meant for himselfthese passed over the mute motionless parsees face unobserved he rose and glided away while awestruck by the aspect of their commander the seamen clustered together on the forecastle till ahab troubledly pacing the deck shouted outto the braces up helmsquare in ,MobyDick or The Whale
in an instant the yards swung round and as the ship halfwheeled upon her heel her three firmseated graceful masts erectly poised upon her long ribbed hull seemed as the three horatii pirouetting on one sufficient steed ,MobyDick or The Whale
i have sat before the dense coal fire and watched it all aglow full of its tormented flaming life and i have seen it wane at last down down to dumbest dust old man of oceans of all this fiery life of thine what will at length remain but one little heap of ashes ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye cried stubb but seacoal ashesmind ye that mr starbuckseacoal not your common charcoal well well i heard ahab mutter here some one thrusts these cards into these old hands of mine swears that i must play them and no others and damn me ahab but thou actest right live in the game and die in it ,MobyDick or The Whale
warmest climes but nurse the cruellest fangs the tiger of bengal crouches in spiced groves of ceaseless verdure skies the most effulgent but basket the deadliest thunders gorgeous cuba knows tornadoes that never swept tame northern lands so too it is that in these resplendent japanese seas the mariner encounters the direst of all storms the typhoon it will sometimes burst from out that cloudless sky like an exploding bomb upon a dazed and sleepy town ,MobyDick or The Whale
towards evening of that day the pequod was torn of her canvas and barepoled was left to fight a typhoon which had struck her directly ahead when darkness came on sky and sea roared and split with the thunder and blazed with the lightning that showed the disabled masts fluttering here and there with the rags which the first fury of the tempest had left for its after sport ,MobyDick or The Whale
holding by a shroud starbuck was standing on the quarterdeck at every flash of the lightning glancing aloft to see what additional disaster might have befallen the intricate hamper there while stubb and flask were directing the men in the higher hoisting and firmer lashing of the boats but all their pains seemed naught though lifted to the very top of the cranes the windward quarter boat ahabs did not escape a great rolling sea dashing high up against the reeling ships high teetering side stove in the boats bottom at the stern and left it again all dripping through like a sieve ,MobyDick or The Whale
bad work bad work mr starbuck said stubb regarding the wreck but the sea will have its way stubb for one cant fight it you see mr starbuck a wave has such a great long start before it leaps all round the world it runs and then comes the spring but as for me all the start i have to meet it is just across the deck here but never mind its all in fun so the old song sayssings ,MobyDick or The Whale
but i am not a brave man never said i was a brave man i am a coward and i sing to keep up my spirits and i tell you what it is mr starbuck theres no way to stop my singing in this world but to cut my throat and when thats done ten to one i sing ye the doxology for a windup ,MobyDick or The Whale
here cried starbuck seizing stubb by the shoulder and pointing his hand towards the weather bow markest thou not that the gale comes from the eastward the very course ahab is to run for moby dick the very course he swung to this day noon now mark his boat there where is that stove in the sternsheets man where he is wont to standhis standpoint is stove man now jump overboard and sing away if thou must ,MobyDick or The Whale
yes yes round the cape of good hope is the shortest way to nantucket soliloquized starbuck suddenly heedless of stubbs question the gale that now hammers at us to stave us we can turn it into a fair wind that will drive us towards home yonder to windward all is blackness of doom but to leeward homewardi see it lightens up there but not with the lightning ,MobyDick or The Whale
now as the lightning rod to a spire on shore is intended to carry off the perilous fluid into the soil so the kindred rod which at sea some ships carry to each mast is intended to conduct it into the water but as this conductor must descend to considerable depth that its end may avoid all contact with the hull and as moreover if kept constantly towing there it would be liable to many mishaps besides interfering not a little with some of the rigging and more or less impeding the vessels way in the water because of all this the lower parts of a ships lightningrods are not always overboard but are generally made in long slender links so as to be the more readily hauled up into the chains outside or thrown down into the sea as occasion may require ,MobyDick or The Whale
the rods the rods cried starbuck to the crew suddenly admonished to vigilance by the vivid lightning that had just been darting flambeaux to light ahab to his post are they overboard drop them over fore and aft quick ,MobyDick or The Whale
avast cried ahab lets have fair play here though we be the weaker side yet ill contribute to raise rods on the himmalehs and andes that all the world may be secured but out on privileges let them be sir ,MobyDick or The Whale
all the yardarms were tipped with a pallid fire and touched at each tripointed lightningrodend with three tapering white flames each of the three tall masts was silently burning in that sulphurous air like three gigantic wax tapers before an altar ,MobyDick or The Whale
blast the boat let it go cried stubb at this instant as a swashing sea heaved up under his own little craft so that its gunwale violently jammed his hand as he was passing a lashing blast itbut slipping backward on the deck his uplifted eyes caught the flames and immediately shifting his tone he criedthe corpusants have mercy on us all ,MobyDick or The Whale
to sailors oaths are household words they will swear in the trance of the calm and in the teeth of the tempest they will imprecate curses from the topsailyardarms when most they teeter over to a seething sea but in all my voyagings seldom have i heard a common oath when gods burning finger has been laid on the ship when his mene mene tekel upharsin has been woven into the shrouds and the cordage ,MobyDick or The Whale
while this pallidness was burning aloft few words were heard from the enchanted crew who in one thick cluster stood on the forecastle all their eyes gleaming in that pale phosphorescence like a far away constellation of stars relieved against the ghostly light the gigantic jet negro daggoo loomed up to thrice his real stature and seemed the black cloud from which the thunder had come the parted mouth of tashtego revealed his sharkwhite teeth which strangely gleamed as if they too had been tipped by corpusants while lit up by the preternatural light queequegs tattooing burned like satanic blue flames on his body ,MobyDick or The Whale
the tableau all waned at last with the pallidness aloft and once more the pequod and every soul on her decks were wrapped in a pall a moment or two passed when starbuck going forward pushed against some one it was stubb what thinkest thou now man i heard thy cry it was not the same in the song ,MobyDick or The Whale
no no it wasnt i said the corpusants have mercy on us all and i hope they will still but do they only have mercy on long faceshave they no bowels for a laugh and look ye mr starbuckbut its too dark to look hear me then i take that masthead flame we saw for a sign of good luck for those masts are rooted in a hold that is going to be chock a block with spermoil dye see and so all that sperm will work up into the masts like sap in a tree yes our three masts will yet be as three spermaceti candlesthats the good promise we saw ,MobyDick or The Whale
at that moment starbuck caught sight of stubbs face slowly beginning to glimmer into sight glancing upwards he cried see see and once more the high tapering flames were beheld with what seemed redoubled supernaturalness in their pallor ,MobyDick or The Whale
at the base of the mainmast full beneath the doubloon and the flame the parsee was kneeling in ahabs front but with his head bowed away from him while near by from the arched and overhanging rigging where they had just been engaged securing a spar a number of the seamen arrested by the glare now cohered together and hung pendulous like a knot of numbed wasps from a drooping orchard twig in various enchanted attitudes like the standing or stepping or running skeletons in herculaneum others remained rooted to the deck but all their eyes upcast ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye aye men cried ahab look up at it mark it well the white flame but lights the way to the white whale hand me those mainmast links there i would fain feel this pulse and let mine beat against it blood against fire so ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh thou clear spirit of clear fire whom on these seas i as persian once did worship till in the sacramental act so burned by thee that to this hour i bear the scar i now know thee thou clear spirit and i now know that thy right worship is defiance to neither love nor reverence wilt thou be kind and een for hate thou canst but kill and all are killed no fearless fool now fronts thee i own thy speechless placeless power but to the last gasp of my earthquake life will dispute its unconditional unintegral mastery in me in the midst of the personified impersonal a personality stands here though but a point at best whencesoeer i came wheresoeer i go yet while i earthly live the queenly personality lives in me and feels her royal rights but war is pain and hate is woe come in thy lowest form of love and i will kneel and kiss thee but at thy highest come as mere supernal power and though thou launchest navies of fullfreighted worlds theres that in here that still remains indifferent oh thou clear spirit of thy fire thou madest me and like a true child of fire i breathe it back to thee ,MobyDick or The Whale
i own thy speechless placeless power said i not so nor was it wrung from me nor do i now drop these links thou canst blind but i can then grope thou canst consume but i can then be ashes take the homage of these poor eyes and shutterhands i would not take it the lightning flashes through my skull mine eyeballs ache and ache my whole beaten brain seems as beheaded and rolling on some stunning ground oh oh yet blindfold yet will i talk to thee light though thou be thou leapest out of darkness but i am darkness leaping out of light leaping out of thee the javelins cease open eyes see or not there burn the flames oh thou magnanimous now i do glory in my genealogy but thou art but my fiery father my sweet mother i know not oh cruel what hast thou done with her there lies my puzzle but thine is greater thou knowest not how came ye hence callest thyself unbegotten certainly knowest not thy beginning hence callest thyself unbegun i know that of me which thou knowest not of thyself oh thou omnipotent there is some unsuffusing thing beyond thee thou clear spirit to whom all thy eternity is but time all thy creativeness mechanical through thee thy flaming self my scorched eyes do dimly see it oh thou foundling fire thou hermit immemorial thou too hast thy incommunicable riddle thy unparticipated grief here again with haughty agony i read my sire leap leap up and lick the sky i leap with thee i burn with thee would fain be welded with thee defyingly i worship thee ,MobyDick or The Whale
ahabs harpoon the one forged at perths fire remained firmly lashed in its conspicuous crotch so that it projected beyond his whaleboats bow but the sea that had stove its bottom had caused the loose leather sheath to drop off and from the keen steel barb there now came a levelled flame of pale forked fire as the silent harpoon burned there like a serpents tongue starbuck grasped ahab by the armgod god is against thee old man forbear tis an ill voyage ill begun ill continued let me square the yards while we may old man and make a fair wind of it homewards to go on a better voyage than this ,MobyDick or The Whale
overhearing starbuck the panicstricken crew instantly ran to the bracesthough not a sail was left aloft for the moment all the aghast mates thoughts seemed theirs they raised a half mutinous cry but dashing the rattling lightning links to the deck and snatching the burning harpoon ahab waved it like a torch among them swearing to transfix with it the first sailor that but cast loose a ropes end petrified by his aspect and still more shrinking from the fiery dart that he held the men fell back in dismay and ahab again spoke ,MobyDick or The Whale
all your oaths to hunt the white whale are as binding as mine and heart soul and body lungs and life old ahab is bound and that ye may know to what tune this heart beats look ye here thus i blow out the last fear and with one blast of his breath he extinguished the flame ,MobyDick or The Whale
as in the hurricane that sweeps the plain men fly the neighborhood of some lone gigantic elm whose very height and strength but render it so much the more unsafe because so much the more a mark for thunderbolts so at those last words of ahabs many of the mariners did run from him in a terror of dismay ,MobyDick or The Whale
strike nothing and stir nothing but lash everything the wind rises but it has not got up to my tablelands yet quick and see to itby masts and keels he takes me for the hunchbacked skipper of some coasting smack send down my maintopsail yard ho gluepots loftiest trucks were made for wildest winds and this braintruck of mine now sails amid the cloudscud shall i strike that oh none but cowards send down their braintrucks in tempest time what a hooroosh aloft there i would een take it for sublime did i not know that the colic is a noisy malady oh take medicine take medicine ,MobyDick or The Whale
no stubb you may pound that knot there as much as you please but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying and how long ago is it since you said the very contrary didnt you once say that whatever ship ahab sails in that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers forward stop now didnt you say so ,MobyDick or The Whale
well suppose i did what then ive part changed my flesh since that time why not my mind besides supposing we are loaded with powder barrels aft and lucifers forward how the devil could the lucifers get afire in this drenching spray here why my little man you have pretty red hair but you couldnt get afire now shake yourself youre aquarius or the waterbearer flask might fill pitchers at your coat collar dont you see then that for these extra risks the marine insurance companies have extra guarantees here are hydrants flask but hark again and ill answer ye the other thing first take your leg off from the crown of the anchor here though so i can pass the rope now listen whats the mighty difference between holding a masts lightningrod in the storm and standing close by a mast that hasnt got any lightningrod at all in a storm dont you see you timberhead that no harm can come to the holder of the rod unless the mast is first struck what are you talking about then not one ship in a hundred carries rods and ahabaye man and all of uswere in no more danger then in my poor opinion than all the crews in ten thousand ships now sailing the seas why you kingpost you i suppose you would have every man in the world go about with a small lightningrod running up the corner of his hat like a militia officers skewered feather and trailing behind like his sash why dont ye be sensible flask its easy to be sensible why dont ye then any man with half an eye can be sensible ,MobyDick or The Whale
yes when a fellows soaked through its hard to be sensible thats a fact and i am about drenched with this spray never mind catch the turn there and pass it seems to me we are lashing down these anchors now as if they were never going to be used again tying these two anchors here flask seems like tying a mans hands behind him and what big generous hands they are to be sure these are your iron fists hey what a hold they have too i wonder flask whether the world is anchored anywhere if she is she swings with an uncommon long cable though there hammer that knot down and weve done so next to touching land lighting on deck is the most satisfactory i say just wring out my jacket skirts will ye thank ye they laugh at longtogs so flask but seems to me a long tailed coat ought always to be worn in all storms afloat the tails tapering down that way serve to carry off the water dye see same with cocked hats the cocks form gableend eavetroughs flask no more monkeyjackets and tarpaulins for me i must mount a swallowtail and drive down a beaver so halloa whew there goes my tarpaulin overboard lord lord that the winds that come from heaven should be so unmannerly this is a nasty night lad ,MobyDick or The Whale
during the most violent shocks of the typhoon the man at the pequods jawbone tiller had several times been reelingly hurled to the deck by its spasmodic motions even though preventer tackles had been attached to itfor they were slackbecause some play to the tiller was indispensable ,MobyDick or The Whale
in a severe gale like this while the ship is but a tossed shuttlecock to the blast it is by no means uncommon to see the needles in the compasses at intervals go round and round it was thus with the pequods at almost every shock the helmsman had not failed to notice the whirling velocity with which they revolved upon the cards it is a sight that hardly anyone can behold without some sort of unwonted emotion ,MobyDick or The Whale
some hours after midnight the typhoon abated so much that through the strenuous exertions of starbuck and stubbone engaged forward and the other aftthe shivered remnants of the jib and fore and maintopsails were cut adrift from the spars and went eddying away to leeward like the feathers of an albatross which sometimes are cast to the winds when that stormtossed bird is on the wing ,MobyDick or The Whale
the three corresponding new sails were now bent and reefed and a stormtrysail was set further aft so that the ship soon went through the water with some precision again and the coursefor the present eastsoutheastwhich he was to steer if practicable was once more given to the helmsman for during the violence of the gale he had only steered according to its vicissitudes but as he was now bringing the ship as near her course as possible watching the compass meanwhile lo a good sign the wind seemed coming round astern aye the foul breeze became fair ,MobyDick or The Whale
instantly the yards were squared to the lively song of ho the fair wind ohyeho cheerly men the crew singing for joy that so promising an event should so soon have falsified the evil portents preceding it ,MobyDick or The Whale
in compliance with the standing order of his commanderto report immediately and at any one of the twentyfour hours any decided change in the affairs of the deckstarbuck had no sooner trimmed the yards to the breezehowever reluctantly and gloomilythan he mechanically went below to apprise captain ahab of the circumstance ,MobyDick or The Whale
ere knocking at his stateroom he involuntarily paused before it a moment the cabin lamptaking long swings this way and thatwas burning fitfully and casting fitful shadows upon the old mans bolted doora thin one with fixed blinds inserted in place of upper panels the isolated subterraneousness of the cabin made a certain humming silence to reign there though it was hooped round by all the roar of the elements the loaded muskets in the rack were shiningly revealed as they stood upright against the forward bulkhead starbuck was an honest upright man but out of starbucks heart at that instant when he saw the muskets there strangely evolved an evil thought but so blent with its neutral or good accompaniments that for the instant he hardly knew it for itself ,MobyDick or The Whale
he would have shot me once he murmured yes theres the very musket that he pointed at methat one with the studded stock let me touch itlift it strange that i who have handled so many deadly lances strange that i should shake so now loaded i must see aye aye and powder in the panthats not good best spill itwait ill cure myself of this ill hold the musket boldly while i thinki come to report a fair wind to him but how fair fair for death and doomthats fair for moby dick its a fair wind thats only fair for that accursed fishthe very tube he pointed at methe very one this onei hold it here he would have killed me with the very thing i handle nowaye and he would fain kill all his crew does he not say he will not strike his spars to any gale has he not dashed his heavenly quadrant and in these same perilous seas gropes he not his way by mere dead reckoning of the errorabounding log and in this very typhoon did he not swear that he would have no lightningrods but shall this crazed old man be tamely suffered to drag a whole ships company down to doom with himyes it would make him the wilful murderer of thirty men and more if this ship come to any deadly harm and come to deadly harm my soul swears this ship will if ahab have his way if then he were this instantput aside that crime would not be his ha is he muttering in his sleep yes just therein there hes sleeping sleeping aye but still alive and soon awake again i cant withstand thee then old man not reasoning not remonstrance not entreaty wilt thou hearken to all this thou scornest flat obedience to thy own flat commands this is all thou breathest aye and sayst the men have vowd thy vow sayst all of us are ahabs great god forbidbut is there no other way no lawful waymake him a prisoner to be taken home what hope to wrest this old mans living power from his own living hands only a fool would try it say he were pinioned even knotted all over with ropes and hawsers chained down to ringbolts on this cabin floor he would be more hideous than a caged tiger then i could not endure the sight could not possibly fly his howlings all comfort sleep itself inestimable reason would leave me on the long intolerable voyage what then remains the land is hundreds of leagues away and locked japan the nearest i stand alone here upon an open sea with two oceans and a whole continent between me and lawaye aye tis sois heaven a murderer when its lightning strikes a wouldbe murderer in his bed tindering sheets and skin togetherand would i be a murderer then ifand slowly stealthily and half sideways looking he placed the loaded muskets end against the door ,MobyDick or The Whale
on this level ahabs hammock swings within his head this way a touch and starbuck may survive to hug his wife and child againoh mary maryboy boy boybut if i wake thee not to death old man who can tell to what unsounded deeps starbucks body this day week may sink with all the crew great god where art thou shall i shall ithe wind has gone down and shifted sir the fore and main topsails are reefed and set she heads her course ,MobyDick or The Whale
next morning the notyetsubsided sea rolled in long slow billows of mighty bulk and striving in the pequods gurgling track pushed her on like giants palms outspread the strong unstaggering breeze abounded so that sky and air seemed vast outbellying sails the whole world boomed before the wind muffled in the full morning light the invisible sun was only known by the spread intensity of his place where his bayonet rays moved on in stacks emblazonings as of crowned babylonian kings and queens reigned over everything the sea was as a crucible of molten gold that bubblingly leaps with light and heat ,MobyDick or The Whale
long maintaining an enchanted silence ahab stood apart and every time the tetering ship loweringly pitched down her bowsprit he turned to eye the bright suns rays produced ahead and when she profoundly settled by the stern he turned behind and saw the suns rearward place and how the same yellow rays were blending with his undeviating wake ,MobyDick or The Whale
thrusting his head half way into the binnacle ahab caught one glimpse of the compasses his uplifted arm slowly fell for a moment he almost seemed to stagger standing behind him starbuck looked and lo the two compasses pointed east and the pequod was as infallibly going west ,MobyDick or The Whale
but ere the first wild alarm could get out abroad among the crew the old man with a rigid laugh exclaimed i have it it has happened before mr starbuck last nights thunder turned our compassesthats all thou hast before now heard of such a thing i take it ,MobyDick or The Whale
here it must needs be said that accidents like this have in more than one case occurred to ships in violent storms the magnetic energy as developed in the mariners needle is as all know essentially one with the electricity beheld in heaven hence it is not to be much marvelled at that such things should be instances where the lightning has actually struck the vessel so as to smite down some of the spars and rigging the effect upon the needle has at times been still more fatal all its loadstone virtue being annihilated so that the before magnetic steel was of no more use than an old wifes knitting needle but in either case the needle never again of itself recovers the original virtue thus marred or lost and if the binnacle compasses be affected the same fate reaches all the others that may be in the ship even were the lowermost one inserted into the kelson ,MobyDick or The Whale
deliberately standing before the binnacle and eyeing the transpointed compasses the old man with the sharp of his extended hand now took the precise bearing of the sun and satisfied that the needles were exactly inverted shouted out his orders for the ships course to be changed accordingly the yards were hard up and once more the pequod thrust her undaunted bows into the opposing wind for the supposed fair one had only been juggling her ,MobyDick or The Whale
meanwhile whatever were his own secret thoughts starbuck said nothing but quietly he issued all requisite orders while stubb and flaskwho in some small degree seemed then to be sharing his feelingslikewise unmurmuringly acquiesced as for the men though some of them lowly rumbled their fear of ahab was greater than their fear of fate but as ever before the pagan harpooneers remained almost wholly unimpressed or if impressed it was only with a certain magnetism shot into their congenial hearts from inflexible ahabs ,MobyDick or The Whale
thou poor proud heavengazer and suns pilot yesterday i wrecked thee and today the compasses would fain have wrecked me so so but ahab is lord over the level loadstone yet mr starbucka lance without a pole a topmaul and the smallest of the sailmakers needles quick ,MobyDick or The Whale
accessory perhaps to the impulse dictating the thing he was now about to do were certain prudential motives whose object might have been to revive the spirits of his crew by a stroke of his subtile skill in a matter so wondrous as that of the inverted compasses besides the old man well knew that to steer by transpointed needles though clumsily practicable was not a thing to be passed over by superstitious sailors without some shudderings and evil portents ,MobyDick or The Whale
men said he steadily turning upon the crew as the mate handed him the things he had demanded my men the thunder turned old ahabs needles but out of this bit of steel ahab can make one of his own that will point as true as any ,MobyDick or The Whale
with a blow from the topmaul ahab knocked off the steel head of the lance and then handing to the mate the long iron rod remaining bade him hold it upright without its touching the deck then with the maul after repeatedly smiting the upper end of this iron rod he placed the blunted needle endwise on the top of it and less strongly hammered that several times the mate still holding the rod as before then going through some small strange motions with itwhether indispensable to the magnetizing of the steel or merely intended to augment the awe of the crew is uncertainhe called for linen thread and moving to the binnacle slipped out the two reversed needles there and horizontally suspended the sailneedle by its middle over one of the compasscards at first the steel went round and round quivering and vibrating at either end but at last it settled to its place when ahab who had been intently watching for this result stepped frankly back from the binnacle and pointing his stretched arm towards it exclaimedlook ye for yourselves if ahab be not lord of the level loadstone the sun is east and that compass swears it ,MobyDick or The Whale
while now the fated pequod had been so long afloat this voyage the log and line had but very seldom been in use owing to a confident reliance upon other means of determining the vessels place some merchantmen and many whalemen especially when cruising wholly neglect to heave the log though at the same time and frequently more for forms sake than anything else regularly putting down upon the customary slate the course steered by the ship as well as the presumed average rate of progression every hour it had been thus with the pequod the wooden reel and angular log attached hung long untouched just beneath the railing of the after bulwarks rains and spray had damped it sun and wind had warped it all the elements had combined to rot a thing that hung so idly but heedless of all this his mood seized ahab as he happened to glance upon the reel not many hours after the magnet scene and he remembered how his quadrant was no more and recalled his frantic oath about the level log and line the ship was sailing plungingly astern the billows rolled in riots ,MobyDick or The Whale
the manxman took the reel and holding it high up by the projecting handleends of the spindle round which the spool of line revolved so stood with the angular log hanging downwards till ahab advanced to him ,MobyDick or The Whale
ahab stood before him and was lightly unwinding some thirty or forty turns to form a preliminary handcoil to toss overboard when the old manxman who was intently eyeing both him and the line made bold to speak ,MobyDick or The Whale
in the isle of man hey well the other way its good heres a man from man a man born in once independent man and now unmanned of man which is sucked inby what up with the reel the dead blind wall butts all inquiring heads at last up with it so ,MobyDick or The Whale
the log was heaved the loose coils rapidly straightened out in a long dragging line astern and then instantly the reel began to whirl in turn jerkingly raised and lowered by the rolling billows the towing resistance of the log caused the old reelman to stagger strangely ,MobyDick or The Whale
i crush the quadrant the thunder turns the needles and now the mad sea parts the logline but ahab can mend all haul in here tahitian reel up manxman and look ye let the carpenter make another log and mend thou the line see to it ,MobyDick or The Whale
there he goes now to him nothings happened but to me the skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world haul in haul in tahitian these lines run whole and whirling out come in broken and dragging slow ha pip come to help eh pip ,MobyDick or The Whale
pip whom call ye pip pip jumped from the whaleboat pips missing lets see now if ye havent fished him up here fisherman it drags hard i guess hes holding on jerk him tahiti jerk him off we haul in no cowards here ho theres his arm just breaking water a hatchet a hatchet cut it offwe haul in no cowards here captain ahab sir sir heres pip trying to get on board again ,MobyDick or The Whale
bellboy sir shipscrier ding dong ding pip pip pip one hundred pounds of clay reward for pip five feet highlooks cowardlyquickest known by that ding dong ding whos seen pip the coward ,MobyDick or The Whale
there can be no hearts above the snowline oh ye frozen heavens look down here ye did beget this luckless child and have abandoned him ye creative libertines here boy ahabs cabin shall be pips home henceforth while ahab lives thou touchest my inmost centre boy thou art tied to me by cords woven of my heartstrings come lets down ,MobyDick or The Whale
whats this heres velvet sharkskin intently gazing at ahabs hand and feeling it ah now had poor pip but felt so kind a thing as this perhaps he had neer been lost this seems to me sir as a manrope something that weak souls may hold by oh sir let old perth now come and rivet these two hands together the black one with the white for i will not let this go ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh boy nor will i thee unless i should thereby drag thee to worse horrors than are here come then to my cabin lo ye believers in gods all goodness and in man all ill lo you see the omniscient gods oblivious of suffering man and man though idiotic and knowing not what he does yet full of the sweet things of love and gratitude come i feel prouder leading thee by thy black hand than though i grasped an emperors ,MobyDick or The Whale
there go two daft ones now muttered the old manxman one daft with strength the other daft with weakness but heres the end of the rotten lineall dripping too mend it eh i think we had best have a new line altogether ill see mr stubb about it ,MobyDick or The Whale
steering now southeastward by ahabs levelled steel and her progress solely determined by ahabs level log and line the pequod held on her path towards the equator making so long a passage through such unfrequented waters descrying no ships and ere long sideways impelled by unvarying trade winds over waves monotonously mild all these seemed the strange calm things preluding some riotous and desperate scene ,MobyDick or The Whale
at last when the ship drew near to the outskirts as it were of the equatorial fishingground and in the deep darkness that goes before the dawn was sailing by a cluster of rocky islets the watchthen headed by flaskwas startled by a cry so plaintively wild and unearthlylike halfarticulated wailings of the ghosts of all herods murdered innocentsthat one and all they started from their reveries and for the space of some moments stood or sat or leaned all transfixedly listening like the carved roman slave while that wild cry remained within hearing the christian or civilized part of the crew said it was mermaids and shuddered but the pagan harpooneers remained unappalled yet the grey manxmanthe oldest mariner of alldeclared that the wild thrilling sounds that were heard were the voices of newly drowned men in the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
below in his hammock ahab did not hear of this till grey dawn when he came to the deck it was then recounted to him by flask not unaccompanied with hinted dark meanings he hollowly laughed and thus explained the wonder ,MobyDick or The Whale
those rocky islands the ship had passed were the resort of great numbers of seals and some young seals that had lost their dams or some dams that had lost their cubs must have risen nigh the ship and kept company with her crying and sobbing with their human sort of wail but this only the more affected some of them because most mariners cherish a very superstitious feeling about seals arising not only from their peculiar tones when in distress but also from the human look of their round heads and semiintelligent faces seen peeringly uprising from the water alongside in the sea under certain circumstances seals have more than once been mistaken for men ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the bodings of the crew were destined to receive a most plausible confirmation in the fate of one of their number that morning at sunrise this man went from his hammock to his masthead at the fore and whether it was that he was not yet half waked from his sleep for sailors sometimes go aloft in a transition state whether it was thus with the man there is now no telling but be that as it may he had not been long at his perch when a cry was hearda cry and a rushingand looking up they saw a falling phantom in the air and looking down a little tossed heap of white bubbles in the blue of the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
the lifebuoya long slender caskwas dropped from the stern where it always hung obedient to a cunning spring but no hand rose to seize it and the sun having long beat upon this cask it had shrunken so that it slowly filled and that parched wood also filled at its every pore and the studded ironbound cask followed the sailor to the bottom as if to yield him his pillow though in sooth but a hard one ,MobyDick or The Whale
and thus the first man of the pequod that mounted the mast to look out for the white whale on the white whales own peculiar ground that man was swallowed up in the deep but few perhaps thought of that at the time indeed in some sort they were not grieved at this event at least as a portent for they regarded it not as a foreshadowing of evil in the future but as the fulfilment of an evil already presaged they declared that now they knew the reason of those wild shrieks they had heard the night before but again the old manxman said nay ,MobyDick or The Whale
the lost lifebuoy was now to be replaced starbuck was directed to see to it but as no cask of sufficient lightness could be found and as in the feverish eagerness of what seemed the approaching crisis of the voyage all hands were impatient of any toil but what was directly connected with its final end whatever that might prove to be therefore they were going to leave the ships stern unprovided with a buoy when by certain strange signs and inuendoes queequeg hinted a hint concerning his coffin ,MobyDick or The Whale
he goes off in a huff the whole he can endure at the parts he baulks now i dont like this i make a leg for captain ahab and he wears it like a gentleman but i make a bandbox for queequeg and he wont put his head into it are all my pains to go for nothing with that coffin and now im ordered to make a lifebuoy of it its like turning an old coat going to bring the flesh on the other side now i dont like this cobbling sort of businessi dont like it at all its undignified its not my place let tinkers brats do tinkerings we are their betters i like to take in hand none but clean virgin fairandsquare mathematical jobs something that regularly begins at the beginning and is at the middle when midway and comes to an end at the conclusion not a cobblers job thats at an end in the middle and at the beginning at the end its the old womans tricks to be giving cobbling jobs lord what an affection all old women have for tinkers i know an old woman of sixtyfive who ran away with a baldheaded young tinker once and thats the reason i never would work for lonely widow old women ashore when i kept my jobshop in the vineyard they might have taken it into their lonely old heads to run off with me but heighho there are no caps at sea but snowcaps let me see nail down the lid caulk the seams pay over the same with pitch batten them down tight and hang it with the snapspring over the ships stern were ever such things done before with a coffin some superstitious old carpenters now would be tied up in the rigging ere they would do the job but im made of knotty aroostook hemlock i dont budge cruppered with a coffin sailing about with a graveyard tray but never mind we workers in woods make bridalbedsteads and cardtables as well as coffins and hearses we work by the month or by the job or by the profit not for us to ask the why and wherefore of our work unless it be too confounded cobbling and then we stash it if we can hem ill do the job now tenderly ill have melets seehow many in the ships company all told but ive forgotten any way ill have me thirty separate turksheaded lifelines each three feet long hanging all round to the coffin then if the hull go down therell be thirty lively fellows all fighting for one coffin a sight not seen very often beneath the sun come hammer caulkingiron pitchpot and marlingspike lets to it ,MobyDick or The Whale
the coffin laid upon two linetubs between the vicebench and the open hatchway the carpenter caulking its seams the string of twisted oakum slowly unwinding from a large roll of it placed in the bosom of his frockahab comes slowly from the cabingangway and hears pip following him ,MobyDick or The Whale
then tell me art thou not an arrant allgrasping intermeddling monopolising heathenish old scamp to be one day making legs and the next day coffins to clap them in and yet again lifebuoys out of those same coffins thou art as unprincipled as the gods and as much of a jackofalltrades ,MobyDick or The Whale
the gods again hark ye dost thou not ever sing working about a coffin the titans they say hummed snatches when chipping out the craters for volcanoes and the gravedigger in the play sings spade in hand dost thou never ,MobyDick or The Whale
sing sir do i sing oh im indifferent enough sir for that but the reason why the gravedigger made music must have been because there was none in his spade sir but the caulking mallet is full of it hark to it ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye and thats because the lid theres a soundingboard and what in all things makes the soundingboard is thistheres naught beneath and yet a coffin with a body in it rings pretty much the same carpenter hast thou ever helped carry a bier and heard the coffin knock against the churchyard gate going in ,MobyDick or The Whale
he goes aft that was sudden now but squalls come sudden in hot latitudes ive heard that the isle of albemarle one of the gallipagos is cut by the equator right in the middle seems to me some sort of equator cuts yon old man too right in his middle hes always under the linefiery hot i tell ye hes looking this waycome oakum quick here we go again this wooden mallet is the cork and im the professor of musical glassestap tap ,MobyDick or The Whale
theres a sight theres a sound the greyheaded woodpecker tapping the hollow tree blind and dumb might well be envied now see that thing rests on two linetubs full of towlines a most malicious wag that fellow rattat so mans seconds tick oh how immaterial are all materials what things real are there but imponderable thoughts here nows the very dreaded symbol of grim death by a mere hap made the expressive sign of the help and hope of most endangered life a lifebuoy of a coffin does it go further can it be that in some spiritual sense the coffin is after all but an immortalitypreserver ill think of that but no so far gone am i in the dark side of earth that its other side the theoretic bright one seems but uncertain twilight to me will ye never have done carpenter with that accursed sound i go below let me not see that thing here when i return again now then pip well talk this over i do suck most wondrous philosophies from thee some unknown conduits from the unknown worlds must empty into thee ,MobyDick or The Whale
next day a large ship the rachel was descried bearing directly down upon the pequod all her spars thickly clustering with men at the time the pequod was making good speed through the water but as the broadwinged windward stranger shot nigh to her the boastful sails all fell together as blank bladders that are burst and all life fled from the smitten hull ,MobyDick or The Whale
throttling his joy ahab negatively answered this unexpected question and would then have fain boarded the stranger when the stranger captain himself having stopped his vessels way was seen descending her side a few keen pulls and his boathook soon clinched the pequods mainchains and he sprang to the deck immediately he was recognised by ahab for a nantucketer he knew but no formal salutation was exchanged ,MobyDick or The Whale
it seemed that somewhat late on the afternoon of the day previous while three of the strangers boats were engaged with a shoal of whales which had led them some four or five miles from the ship and while they were yet in swift chase to windward the white hump and head of moby dick had suddenly loomed up out of the water not very far to leeward whereupon the fourth rigged boata reserved onehad been instantly lowered in chase after a keen sail before the wind this fourth boatthe swiftest keeled of allseemed to have succeeded in fasteningat least as well as the man at the masthead could tell anything about it in the distance he saw the diminished dotted boat and then a swift gleam of bubbling white water and after that nothing more whence it was concluded that the stricken whale must have indefinitely run away with his pursuers as often happens there was some apprehension but no positive alarm as yet the recall signals were placed in the rigging darkness came on and forced to pick up her three far to windward boatsere going in quest of the fourth one in the precisely opposite directionthe ship had not only been necessitated to leave that boat to its fate till near midnight but for the time to increase her distance from it but the rest of her crew being at last safe aboard she crowded all sailstunsail on stunsailafter the missing boat kindling a fire in her trypots for a beacon and every other man aloft on the lookout but though when she had thus sailed a sufficient distance to gain the presumed place of the absent ones when last seen though she then paused to lower her spare boats to pull all around her and not finding anything had again dashed on again paused and lowered her boats and though she had thus continued doing till daylight yet not the least glimpse of the missing keel had been seen ,MobyDick or The Whale
the story told the stranger captain immediately went on to reveal his object in boarding the pequod he desired that ship to unite with his own in the search by sailing over the sea some four or five miles apart on parallel lines and so sweeping a double horizon as it were ,MobyDick or The Whale
i will wager something now whispered stubb to flask that some one in that missing boat wore off that captains best coat mayhap his watchhes so cursed anxious to get it back who ever heard of two pious whaleships cruising after one missing whaleboat in the height of the whaling season see flask only see how pale he lookspale in the very buttons of his eyeslookit wasnt the coatit must have been the ,MobyDick or The Whale
my boy my own boy is among them for gods sakei beg i conjurehere exclaimed the stranger captain to ahab who thus far had but icily received his petition for eightandforty hours let me charter your shipi will gladly pay for it and roundly pay for itif there be no other wayfor eightandforty hours onlyonly thatyou must oh you must and you shall do this thing ,MobyDick or The Whale
now as it shortly turned out what made this incident of the rachels the more melancholy was the circumstance that not only was one of the captains sons among the number of the missing boats crew but among the number of the other boats crews at the same time but on the other hand separated from the ship during the dark vicissitudes of the chase there had been still another son as that for a time the wretched father was plunged to the bottom of the cruellest perplexity which was only solved for him by his chief mates instinctively adopting the ordinary procedure of a whaleship in such emergencies that is when placed between jeopardized but divided boats always to pick up the majority first but the captain for some unknown constitutional reason had refrained from mentioning all this and not till forced to it by ahabs iciness did he allude to his one yet missing boy a little lad but twelve years old whose father with the earnest but unmisgiving hardihood of a nantucketers paternal love had thus early sought to initiate him in the perils and wonders of a vocation almost immemorially the destiny of all his race nor does it unfrequently occur that nantucket captains will send a son of such tender age away from them for a protracted three or four years voyage in some other ship than their own so that their first knowledge of a whalemans career shall be unenervated by any chance display of a fathers natural but untimely partiality or undue apprehensiveness and concern ,MobyDick or The Whale
i will not go said the stranger till you say aye to me do to me as you would have me do to you in the like case for you too have a boy captain ahabthough but a child and nestling safely at home nowa child of your old age tooyes yes you relent i see itrun run men now and stand by to square in the yards ,MobyDick or The Whale
avast cried ahabtouch not a ropeyarn then in a voice that prolongingly moulded every wordcaptain gardiner i will not do it even now i lose time goodbye goodbye god bless ye man and may i forgive myself but i must go mr starbuck look at the binnacle watch and in three minutes from this present instant warn off all strangers then brace forward again and let the ship sail as before ,MobyDick or The Whale
hurriedly turning with averted face he descended into his cabin leaving the strange captain transfixed at this unconditional and utter rejection of his so earnest suit but starting from his enchantment gardiner silently hurried to the side more fell than stepped into his boat and returned to his ship ,MobyDick or The Whale
soon the two ships diverged their wakes and long as the strange vessel was in view she was seen to yaw hither and thither at every dark spot however small on the sea this way and that her yards were swung round starboard and larboard she continued to tack now she beat against a head sea and again it pushed her before it while all the while her masts and yards were thickly clustered with men as three tall cherry trees when the boys are cherrying among the boughs ,MobyDick or The Whale
but by her still halting course and winding woeful way you plainly saw that this ship that so wept with spray still remained without comfort she was rachel weeping for her children because they were not ,MobyDick or The Whale
lad lad i tell thee thou must not follow ahab now the hour is coming when ahab would not scare thee from him yet would not have thee by him there is that in thee poor lad which i feel too curing to my malady like cures like and for this hunt my malady becomes my most desired health do thou abide below here where they shall serve thee as if thou wert the captain aye lad thou shalt sit here in my own screwed chair another screw to it thou must be ,MobyDick or The Whale
they tell me sir that stubb did once desert poor little pip whose drowned bones now show white for all the blackness of his living skin but i will never desert ye sir as stubb did him sir i must go with ye ,MobyDick or The Whale
weep so and i will murder thee have a care for ahab too is mad listen and thou wilt often hear my ivory foot upon the deck and still know that i am there and now i quit thee thy handmet true art thou lad as the circumference to its centre so god for ever bless thee and if it come to thatgod for ever save thee let what will befall ,MobyDick or The Whale
here he this instant stood i stand in his airbut im alone now were even poor pip here i could endure it but hes missing pip pip ding dong ding whos seen pip he must be up here lets try the door what neither lock nor bolt nor bar and yet theres no opening it it must be the spell he told me to stay here aye and told me this screwed chair was mine here then ill seat me against the transom in the ships full middle all her keel and her three masts before me here our old sailors say in their black seventyfours great admirals sometimes sit at table and lord it over rows of captains and lieutenants ha whats this epaulets epaulets the epaulets all come crowding pass round the decanters glad to see ye fill up monsieurs what an odd feeling now when a black boys host to white men with gold lace upon their coatsmonsieurs have ye seen one pipa little negro lad five feet high hangdog look and cowardly jumped from a whaleboat onceseen him no well then fill up again captains and lets drink shame upon all cowards i name no names shame upon them put one foot upon the table shame upon all cowardshist above there i hear ivoryoh master master i am indeed downhearted when you walk over me but here ill stay though this stern strikes rocks and they bulge through and oysters come to join me ,MobyDick or The Whale
and now that at the proper time and place after so long and wide a preliminary cruise ahaball other whaling waters sweptseemed to have chased his foe into an oceanfold to slay him the more securely there now that he found himself hard by the very latitude and longitude where his tormenting wound had been inflicted now that a vessel had been spoken which on the very day preceding had actually encountered moby dickand now that all his successive meetings with various ships contrastingly concurred to show the demoniac indifference with which the white whale tore his hunters whether sinning or sinned against now it was that there lurked a something in the old mans eyes which it was hardly sufferable for feeble souls to see as the unsetting polar star which through the livelong arctic six months night sustains its piercing steady central gaze so ahabs purpose now fixedly gleamed down upon the constant midnight of the gloomy crew it domineered above them so that all their bodings doubts misgivings fears were fain to hide beneath their souls and not sprout forth a single spear or leaf ,MobyDick or The Whale
in this foreshadowing interval too all humor forced or natural vanished stubb no more strove to raise a smile starbuck no more strove to check one alike joy and sorrow hope and fear seemed ground to finest dust and powdered for the time in the clamped mortar of ahabs iron soul like machines they dumbly moved about the deck ever conscious that the old mans despot eye was on them ,MobyDick or The Whale
but did you deeply scan him in his more secret confidential hours when he thought no glance but one was on him then you would have seen that even as ahabs eyes so awed the crews the inscrutable parsees glance awed his or somehow at least in some wild way at times affected it such an added gliding strangeness began to invest the thin fedallah now such ceaseless shudderings shook him that the men looked dubious at him half uncertain as it seemed whether indeed he were a mortal substance or else a tremulous shadow cast upon the deck by some unseen beings body and that shadow was always hovering there for not by night even had fedallah ever certainly been known to slumber or go below he would stand still for hours but never sat or leaned his wan but wondrous eyes did plainly saywe two watchmen never rest ,MobyDick or The Whale
nor at any time by night or day could the mariners now step upon the deck unless ahab was before them either standing in his pivothole or exactly pacing the planks between two undeviating limitsthe mainmast and the mizen or else they saw him standing in the cabinscuttlehis living foot advanced upon the deck as if to step his hat slouched heavily over his eyes so that however motionless he stood however the days and nights were added on that he had not swung in his hammock yet hidden beneath that slouching hat they could never tell unerringly whether for all this his eyes were really closed at times or whether he was still intently scanning them no matter though he stood so in the scuttle for a whole hour on the stretch and the unheeded nightdamp gathered in beads of dew upon that stonecarved coat and hat the clothes that the night had wet the next days sunshine dried upon him and so day after day and night after night he went no more beneath the planks whatever he wanted from the cabin that thing he sent for ,MobyDick or The Whale
he ate in the same open air that is his two only mealsbreakfast and dinner supper he never touched nor reaped his beard which darkly grew all gnarled as unearthed roots of trees blown over which still grow idly on at naked base though perished in the upper verdure but though his whole life was now become one watch on deck and though the parsees mystic watch was without intermission as his own yet these two never seemed to speakone man to the otherunless at long intervals some passing unmomentous matter made it necessary though such a potent spell seemed secretly to join the twain openly and to the awestruck crew they seemed polelike asunder if by day they chanced to speak one word by night dumb men were both so far as concerned the slightest verbal interchange at times for longest hours without a single hail they stood far parted in the starlight ahab in his scuttle the parsee by the mainmast but still fixedly gazing upon each other as if in the parsee ahab saw his forethrown shadow in ahab the parsee his abandoned substance ,MobyDick or The Whale
and yet somehow did ahabin his own proper self as daily hourly and every instant commandingly revealed to his subordinatesahab seemed an independent lord the parsee but his slave still again both seemed yoked together and an unseen tyrant driving them the lean shade siding the solid rib for be this parsee what he may all rib and keel was solid ahab ,MobyDick or The Whale
at the first faintest glimmering of the dawn his iron voice was heard from aftman the mastheadsand all through the day till after sunset and after twilight the same voice every hour at the striking of the helmsmans bell was heardwhat dye seesharp sharp ,MobyDick or The Whale
but when three or four days had slided by after meeting the childrenseeking rachel and no spout had yet been seen the monomaniac old man seemed distrustful of his crews fidelity at least of nearly all except the pagan harpooneers he seemed to doubt even whether stubb and flask might not willingly overlook the sight he sought but if these suspicions were really his he sagaciously refrained from verbally expressing them however his actions might seem to hint them ,MobyDick or The Whale
i will have the first sight of the whale myselfhe said aye ahab must have the doubloon and with his own hands he rigged a nest of basketed bowlines and sending a hand aloft with a single sheaved block to secure to the mainmast head he received the two ends of the downwardreeved rope and attaching one to his basket prepared a pin for the other end in order to fasten it at the rail this done with that end yet in his hand and standing beside the pin he looked round upon his crew sweeping from one to the other pausing his glance long upon daggoo queequeg tashtego but shunning fedallah and then settling his firm relying eye upon the chief mate saidtake the rope siri give it into thy hands starbuck then arranging his person in the basket he gave the word for them to hoist him to his perch starbuck being the one who secured the rope at last and afterwards stood near it and thus with one hand clinging round the royal mast ahab gazed abroad upon the sea for miles and milesahead astern this side and thatwithin the wide expanded circle commanded at so great a height ,MobyDick or The Whale
when in working with his hands at some lofty almost isolated place in the rigging which chances to afford no foothold the sailor at sea is hoisted up to that spot and sustained there by the rope under these circumstances its fastened end on deck is always given in strict charge to some one man who has the special watch of it because in such a wilderness of running rigging whose various different relations aloft cannot always be infallibly discerned by what is seen of them at the deck and when the deckends of these ropes are being every few minutes cast down from the fastenings it would be but a natural fatality if unprovided with a constant watchman the hoisted sailor should by some carelessness of the crew be cast adrift and fall all swooping to the sea so ahabs proceedings in this matter were not unusual the only strange thing about them seemed to be that starbuck almost the one only man who had ever ventured to oppose him with anything in the slightest degree approaching to decisionone of those too whose faithfulness on the lookout he had seemed to doubt somewhatit was strange that this was the very man he should select for his watchman freely giving his whole life into such an otherwise distrusted persons hands ,MobyDick or The Whale
now the first time ahab was perched aloft ere he had been there ten minutes one of those redbilled savage seahawks which so often fly incommodiously close round the manned mastheads of whalemen in these latitudes one of these birds came wheeling and screaming round his head in a maze of untrackably swift circlings then it darted a thousand feet straight up into the air then spiralized downwards and went eddying again round his head ,MobyDick or The Whale
but with his gaze fixed upon the dim and distant horizon ahab seemed not to mark this wild bird nor indeed would any one else have marked it much it being no uncommon circumstance only now almost the least heedful eye seemed to see some sort of cunning meaning in almost every sight ,MobyDick or The Whale
your hat your hat sir suddenly cried the sicilian seaman who being posted at the mizenmasthead stood directly behind ahab though somewhat lower than his level and with a deep gulf of air dividing them ,MobyDick or The Whale
an eagle flew thrice round tarquins head removing his cap to replace it and thereupon tanaquil his wife declared that tarquin would be king of rome but only by the replacing of the cap was that omen accounted good ahabs hat was never restored the wild hawk flew on and on with it far in advance of the prow and at last disappeared while from the point of that disappearance a minute black spot was dimly discerned falling from that vast height into the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
the intense pequod sailed on the rolling waves and days went by the lifebuoycoffin still lightly swung and another ship most miserably misnamed the delight was descried as she drew nigh all eyes were fixed upon her broad beams called shears which in some whalingships cross the quarterdeck at the height of eight or nine feet serving to carry the spare unrigged or disabled boats ,MobyDick or The Whale
upon the strangers shears were beheld the shattered white ribs and some few splintered planks of what had once been a whaleboat but you now saw through this wreck as plainly as you see through the peeled halfunhinged and bleaching skeleton of a horse ,MobyDick or The Whale
not forged and snatching perths levelled iron from the crotch ahab held it out exclaiminglook ye nantucketer here in this hand i hold his death tempered in blood and tempered by lightning are these barbs and i swear to temper them triply in that hot place behind the fin where the white whale most feels his accursed life ,MobyDick or The Whale
then god keep thee old manseest thou thatpointing to the hammocki bury but one of five stout men who were alive only yesterday but were dead ere night only that one i bury the rest were buried before they died you sail upon their tomb then turning to his creware ye ready there place the plank then on the rail and lift the body so thenoh godadvancing towards the hammock with uplifted handsmay the resurrection and the life ,MobyDick or The Whale
but the suddenly started pequod was not quick enough to escape the sound of the splash that the corpse soon made as it struck the sea not so quick indeed but that some of the flying bubbles might have sprinkled her hull with their ghostly baptism ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was a clear steelblue day the firmaments of air and sea were hardly separable in that allpervading azure only the pensive air was transparently pure and soft with a womans look and the robust and manlike sea heaved with long strong lingering swells as samsons chest in his sleep ,MobyDick or The Whale
hither and thither on high glided the snowwhite wings of small unspeckled birds these were the gentle thoughts of the feminine air but to and fro in the deeps far down in the bottomless blue rushed mighty leviathans swordfish and sharks and these were the strong troubled murderous thinkings of the masculine sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
aloft like a royal czar and king the sun seemed giving this gentle air to this bold and rolling sea even as bride to groom and at the girdling line of the horizon a soft and tremulous motionmost seen here at the equatordenoted the fond throbbing trust the loving alarms with which the poor bride gave her bosom away ,MobyDick or The Whale
tied up and twisted gnarled and knotted with wrinkles haggardly firm and unyielding his eyes glowing like coals that still glow in the ashes of ruin untottering ahab stood forth in the clearness of the morn lifting his splintered helmet of a brow to the fair girls forehead of heaven ,MobyDick or The Whale
oh immortal infancy and innocency of the azure invisible winged creatures that frolic all round us sweet childhood of air and sky how oblivious were ye of old ahabs closecoiled woe but so have i seen little miriam and martha laughingeyed elves heedlessly gambol around their old sire sporting with the circle of singed locks which grew on the marge of that burntout crater of his brain ,MobyDick or The Whale
slowly crossing the deck from the scuttle ahab leaned over the side and watched how his shadow in the water sank and sank to his gaze the more and the more that he strove to pierce the profundity but the lovely aromas in that enchanted air did at last seem to dispel for a moment the cankerous thing in his soul that glad happy air that winsome sky did at last stroke and caress him the stepmother world so long cruelforbiddingnow threw affectionate arms round his stubborn neck and did seem to joyously sob over him as if over one that however wilful and erring she could yet find it in her heart to save and to bless from beneath his slouched hat ahab dropped a tear into the sea nor did all the pacific contain such wealth as that one wee drop ,MobyDick or The Whale
starbuck saw the old man saw him how he heavily leaned over the side and he seemed to hear in his own true heart the measureless sobbing that stole out of the centre of the serenity around careful not to touch him or be noticed by him he yet drew near to him and stood there ,MobyDick or The Whale

what is it what nameless inscrutable unearthly thing is it what cozening hidden lord and master and cruel remorseless emperor commands me that against all natural lovings and longings i so keep pushing and crowding and jamming myself on all the time recklessly making me ready to do what in my own proper natural heart i durst not so much as dare is ahab ahab is it i god or who that lifts this arm but if the great sun move not of himself but is as an errandboy in heaven nor one single star can revolve but by some invisible power how then can this one small heart beat this one small brain think thoughts unless god does that beating does that thinking does that living and not i by heaven man we are turned round and round in this world like yonder windlass and fate is the handspike and all the time lo that smiling sky and this unsounded sea look see yon albicore who put it into him to chase and fang that flyingfish where do murderers go man whos to doom when the judge himself is dragged to the bar but it is a mild mild wind and a mild looking sky and the air smells now as if it blew from a faraway meadow they have been making hay somewhere under the slopes of the andes starbuck and the mowers are sleeping among the newmown hay sleeping aye toil we how we may we all sleep at last on the field sleep aye and rust amid greenness as last years scythes flung down and left in the halfcut swathsstarbuck ,MobyDick or The Whale
that night in the midwatch when the old manas his wont at intervalsstepped forth from the scuttle in which he leaned and went to his pivothole he suddenly thrust out his face fiercely snuffing up the sea air as a sagacious ships dog will in drawing nigh to some barbarous isle he declared that a whale must be near soon that peculiar odor sometimes to a great distance given forth by the living sperm whale was palpable to all the watch nor was any mariner surprised when after inspecting the compass and then the dogvane and then ascertaining the precise bearing of the odor as nearly as possible ahab rapidly ordered the ships course to be slightly altered and the sail to be shortened ,MobyDick or The Whale
the acute policy dictating these movements was sufficiently vindicated at daybreak by the sight of a long sleek on the sea directly and lengthwise ahead smooth as oil and resembling in the pleated watery wrinkles bordering it the polished metalliclike marks of some swift tiderip at the mouth of a deep rapid stream ,MobyDick or The Whale
thundering with the butts of three clubbed handspikes on the forecastle deck daggoo roused the sleepers with such judgment claps that they seemed to exhale from the scuttle so instantaneously did they appear with their clothes in their hands ,MobyDick or The Whale
all sail being set he now cast loose the lifeline reserved for swaying him to the main royalmast head and in a few moments they were hoisting him thither when while but two thirds of the way aloft and while peering ahead through the horizontal vacancy between the maintopsail and topgallantsail he raised a gulllike cry in the air there she blowsthere she blows a hump like a snowhill it is moby dick ,MobyDick or The Whale
fired by the cry which seemed simultaneously taken up by the three lookouts the men on deck rushed to the rigging to behold the famous whale they had so long been pursuing ahab had now gained his final perch some feet above the other lookouts tashtego standing just beneath him on the cap of the topgallantmast so that the indians head was almost on a level with ahabs heel from this height the whale was now seen some mile or so ahead at every roll of the sea revealing his high sparkling hump and regularly jetting his silent spout into the air to the credulous mariners it seemed the same silent spout they had so long ago beheld in the moonlit atlantic and indian oceans ,MobyDick or The Whale
not the same instant not the sameno the doubloon is mine fate reserved the doubloon for me i only none of ye could have raised the white whale first there she blowsthere she blowsthere she blows there againthere again he cried in longdrawn lingering methodic tones attuned to the gradual prolongings of the whales visible jets hes going to sound in stunsails down topgallantsails stand by three boats mr starbuck remember stay on board and keep the ship helm there luff luff a point so steady man steady there go flukes no no only black water all ready the boats there stand by stand by lower me mr starbuck lower lowerquick quicker and he slid through the air to the deck ,MobyDick or The Whale
soon all the boats but starbucks were dropped all the boatsails setall the paddles plying with rippling swiftness shooting to leeward and ahab heading the onset a pale deathglimmer lit up fedallahs sunken eyes a hideous motion gnawed his mouth ,MobyDick or The Whale
like noiseless nautilus shells their light prows sped through the sea but only slowly they neared the foe as they neared him the ocean grew still more smooth seemed drawing a carpet over its waves seemed a noonmeadow so serenely it spread at length the breathless hunter came so nigh his seemingly unsuspecting prey that his entire dazzling hump was distinctly visible sliding along the sea as if an isolated thing and continually set in a revolving ring of finest fleecy greenish foam he saw the vast involved wrinkles of the slightly projecting head beyond before it far out on the soft turkishrugged waters went the glistening white shadow from his broad milky forehead a musical rippling playfully accompanying the shade and behind the blue waters interchangeably flowed over into the moving valley of his steady wake and on either hand bright bubbles arose and danced by his side but these were broken again by the light toes of hundreds of gay fowl softly feathering the sea alternate with their fitful flight and like to some flagstaff rising from the painted hull of an argosy the tall but shattered pole of a recent lance projected from the white whales back and at intervals one of the cloud of softtoed fowls hovering and to and fro skimming like a canopy over the fish silently perched and rocked on this pole the long tail feathers streaming like pennons ,MobyDick or The Whale
a gentle joyousnessa mighty mildness of repose in swiftness invested the gliding whale not the white bull jupiter swimming away with ravished europa clinging to his graceful horns his lovely leering eyes sideways intent upon the maid with smooth bewitching fleetness rippling straight for the nuptial bower in crete not jove not that great majesty supreme did surpass the glorified white whale as he so divinely swam ,MobyDick or The Whale
on each soft sidecoincident with the parted swell that but once leaving him then flowed so wide awayon each bright side the whale shed off enticings no wonder there had been some among the hunters who namelessly transported and allured by all this serenity had ventured to assail it but had fatally found that quietude but the vesture of tornadoes yet calm enticing calm oh whale thou glidest on to all who for the first time eye thee no matter how many in that same way thou mayst have bejuggled and destroyed before ,MobyDick or The Whale
and thus through the serene tranquillities of the tropical sea among waves whose handclappings were suspended by exceeding rapture moby dick moved on still withholding from sight the full terrors of his submerged trunk entirely hiding the wrenched hideousness of his jaw but soon the fore part of him slowly rose from the water for an instant his whole marbleized body formed a high arch like virginias natural bridge and warningly waving his bannered flukes in the air the grand god revealed himself sounded and went out of sight hoveringly halting and dipping on the wing the white seafowls longingly lingered over the agitated pool that he left ,MobyDick or The Whale
an hour said ahab standing rooted in his boats stern and he gazed beyond the whales place towards the dim blue spaces and wide wooing vacancies to leeward it was only an instant for again his eyes seemed whirling round in his head as he swept the watery circle the breeze now freshened the sea began to swell ,MobyDick or The Whale
in long indian file as when herons take wing the white birds were now all flying towards ahabs boat and when within a few yards began fluttering over the water there wheeling round and round with joyous expectant cries their vision was keener than mans ahab could discover no sign in the sea but suddenly as he peered down and down into its depths he profoundly saw a white living spot no bigger than a white weasel with wonderful celerity uprising and magnifying as it rose till it turned and then there were plainly revealed two long crooked rows of white glistening teeth floating up from the undiscoverable bottom it was moby dicks open mouth and scrolled jaw his vast shadowed bulk still half blending with the blue of the sea the glittering mouth yawned beneath the boat like an opendoored marble tomb and giving one sidelong sweep with his steering oar ahab whirled the craft aside from this tremendous apparition then calling upon fedallah to change places with him went forward to the bows and seizing perths harpoon commanded his crew to grasp their oars and stand by to stern ,MobyDick or The Whale
now by reason of this timely spinning round the boat upon its axis its bow by anticipation was made to face the whales head while yet under water but as if perceiving this stratagem moby dick with that malicious intelligence ascribed to him sidelingly transplanted himself as it were in an instant shooting his pleated head lengthwise beneath the boat ,MobyDick or The Whale
through and through through every plank and each rib it thrilled for an instant the whale obliquely lying on his back in the manner of a biting shark slowly and feelingly taking its bows full within his mouth so that the long narrow scrolled lower jaw curled high up into the open air and one of the teeth caught in a rowlock the bluish pearlwhite of the inside of the jaw was within six inches of ahabs head and reached higher than that in this attitude the white whale now shook the slight cedar as a mildly cruel cat her mouse with unastonished eyes fedallah gazed and crossed his arms but the tigeryellow crew were tumbling over each others heads to gain the uttermost stern ,MobyDick or The Whale
and now while both elastic gunwales were springing in and out as the whale dallied with the doomed craft in this devilish way and from his body being submerged beneath the boat he could not be darted at from the bows for the bows were almost inside of him as it were and while the other boats involuntarily paused as before a quick crisis impossible to withstand then it was that monomaniac ahab furious with this tantalizing vicinity of his foe which placed him all alive and helpless in the very jaws he hated frenzied with all this he seized the long bone with his naked hands and wildly strove to wrench it from its gripe as now he thus vainly strove the jaw slipped from him the frail gunwales bent in collapsed and snapped as both jaws like an enormous shears sliding further aft bit the craft completely in twain and locked themselves fast again in the sea midway between the two floating wrecks these floated aside the broken ends drooping the crew at the sternwreck clinging to the gunwales and striving to hold fast to the oars to lash them across ,MobyDick or The Whale
at that preluding moment ere the boat was yet snapped ahab the first to perceive the whales intent by the crafty upraising of his head a movement that loosed his hold for the time at that moment his hand had made one final effort to push the boat out of the bite but only slipping further into the whales mouth and tilting over sideways as it slipped the boat had shaken off his hold on the jaw spilled him out of it as he leaned to the push and so he fell flatfaced upon the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
ripplingly withdrawing from his prey moby dick now lay at a little distance vertically thrusting his oblong white head up and down in the billows and at the same time slowly revolving his whole spindled body so that when his vast wrinkled forehead rosesome twenty or more feet out of the waterthe now rising swells with all their confluent waves dazzlingly broke against it vindictively tossing their shivered spray still higher into the air so in a gale the but half baffled channel billows only recoil from the base of the eddystone triumphantly to overleap its summit with their scud ,MobyDick or The Whale
this motion is peculiar to the sperm whale it receives its designation pitchpoling from its being likened to that preliminary upanddown poise of the whalelance in the exercise called pitchpoling previously described by this motion the whale must best and most comprehensively view whatever objects may be encircling him ,MobyDick or The Whale
but soon resuming his horizontal attitude moby dick swam swiftly round and round the wrecked crew sideways churning the water in his vengeful wake as if lashing himself up to still another and more deadly assault the sight of the splintered boat seemed to madden him as the blood of grapes and mulberries cast before antiochuss elephants in the book of maccabees meanwhile ahab half smothered in the foam of the whales insolent tail and too much of a cripple to swimthough he could still keep afloat even in the heart of such a whirlpool as that helpless ahabs head was seen like a tossed bubble which the least chance shock might burst from the boats fragmentary stern fedallah incuriously and mildly eyed him the clinging crew at the other drifting end could not succor him more than enough was it for them to look to themselves for so revolvingly appalling was the white whales aspect and so planetarily swift the evercontracting circles he made that he seemed horizontally swooping upon them and though the other boats unharmed still hovered hard by still they dared not pull into the eddy to strike lest that should be the signal for the instant destruction of the jeopardized castaways ahab and all nor in that case could they themselves hope to escape with straining eyes then they remained on the outer edge of the direful zone whose centre had now become the old mans head ,MobyDick or The Whale
meantime from the beginning all this had been descried from the ships mast heads and squaring her yards she had borne down upon the scene and was now so nigh that ahab in the water hailed hersail on thebut that moment a breaking sea dashed on him from moby dick and whelmed him for the time but struggling out of it again and chancing to rise on a towering crest he shoutedsail on the whaledrive him off ,MobyDick or The Whale
dragged into stubbs boat with bloodshot blinded eyes the white brine caking in his wrinkles the long tension of ahabs bodily strength did crack and helplessly he yielded to his bodys doom for a time lying all crushed in the bottom of stubbs boat like one trodden under foot of herds of elephants far inland nameless wails came from him as desolate sounds from out ravines ,MobyDick or The Whale
but this intensity of his physical prostration did but so much the more abbreviate it in an instants compass great hearts sometimes condense to one deep pang the sum total of those shallow pains kindly diffused through feebler mens whole lives and so such hearts though summary in each one suffering still if the gods decree it in their lifetime aggregate a whole age of woe wholly made up of instantaneous intensities for even in their pointless centres those noble natures contain the entire circumferences of inferior souls ,MobyDick or The Whale
thats goodhelp me man i wish to stand so so i see him there there going to leeward still what a leaping spouthands off from me the eternal sap runs up in ahabs bones again set the sail out oars the helm ,MobyDick or The Whale
it is often the case that when a boat is stove its crew being picked up by another boat help to work that second boat and the chase is thus continued with what is called doublebanked oars it was thus now but the added power of the boat did not equal the added power of the whale for he seemed to have treblebanked his every fin swimming with a velocity which plainly showed that if now under these circumstances pushed on the chase would prove an indefinitely prolonged if not a hopeless one nor could any crew endure for so long a period such an unintermitted intense straining at the oar a thing barely tolerable only in some one brief vicissitude the ship itself then as it sometimes happens offered the most promising intermediate means of overtaking the chase accordingly the boats now made for her and were soon swayed up to their cranesthe two parts of the wrecked boat having been previously secured by herand then hoisting everything to her side and stacking her canvas high up and sideways outstretching it with stunsails like the doublejointed wings of an albatross the pequod bore down in the leeward wake of mobydick at the well known methodic intervals the whales glittering spout was regularly announced from the manned mastheads and when he would be reported as just gone down ahab would take the time and then pacing the deck binnaclewatch in hand so soon as the last second of the allotted hour expired his voice was heardwhose is the doubloon now dye see him and if the reply was no sir straightway he commanded them to lift him to his perch in this way the day wore on ahab now aloft and motionless anon unrestingly pacing the planks ,MobyDick or The Whale
as he was thus walking uttering no sound except to hail the men aloft or to bid them hoist a sail still higher or to spread one to a still greater breadththus to and fro pacing beneath his slouched hat at every turn he passed his own wrecked boat which had been dropped upon the quarterdeck and lay there reversed broken bow to shattered stern at last he paused before it and as in an already overclouded sky fresh troops of clouds will sometimes sail across so over the old mans face there now stole some such added gloom as this ,MobyDick or The Whale
stubb saw him pause and perhaps intending not vainly though to evince his own unabated fortitude and thus keep up a valiant place in his captains mind he advanced and eyeing the wreck exclaimedthe thistle the ass refused it pricked his mouth too keenly sir ha ha ,MobyDick or The Whale
what soulless thing is this that laughs before a wreck man man did i not know thee brave as fearless fire and as mechanical i could swear thou wert a poltroon groan nor laugh should be heard before a wreck ,MobyDick or The Whale
omen omenthe dictionary if the gods think to speak outright to man they will honorably speak outright not shake their heads and give an old wives darkling hintbegone ye two are the opposite poles of one thing starbuck is stubb reversed and stubb is starbuck and ye two are all mankind and ahab stands alone among the millions of the peopled earth nor gods nor men his neighbors cold coldi shiverhow now aloft there dye see him sing out for every spout though he spout ten times a second ,MobyDick or The Whale
good he will travel slower now tis night down royals and topgallant stunsails mr starbuck we must not run over him before morning hes making a passage now and may heaveto a while helm there keep her full before the windaloft come downmr stubb send a fresh hand to the foremast head and see it manned till morningthen advancing towards the doubloon in the mainmastmen this gold is mine for i earned it but i shall let it abide here till the white whale is dead and then whosoever of ye first raises him upon the day he shall be killed this gold is that mans and if on that day i shall again raise him then ten times its sum shall be divided among all of ye away nowthe deck is thine sir ,MobyDick or The Whale
here be it said that this pertinacious pursuit of one particular whale continued through day into night and through night into day is a thing by no means unprecedented in the south sea fishery for such is the wonderful skill prescience of experience and invincible confidence acquired by some great natural geniuses among the nantucket commanders that from the simple observation of a whale when last descried they will under certain given circumstances pretty accurately foretell both the direction in which he will continue to swim for a time while out of sight as well as his probable rate of progression during that period and in these cases somewhat as a pilot when about losing sight of a coast whose general trending he well knows and which he desires shortly to return to again but at some further point like as this pilot stands by his compass and takes the precise bearing of the cape at present visible in order the more certainly to hit aright the remote unseen headland eventually to be visited so does the fisherman at his compass with the whale for after being chased and diligently marked through several hours of daylight then when night obscures the fish the creatures future wake through the darkness is almost as established to the sagacious mind of the hunter as the pilots coast is to him so that to this hunters wondrous skill the proverbial evanescence of a thing writ in water a wake is to all desired purposes well nigh as reliable as the steadfast land and as the mighty iron leviathan of the modern railway is so familiarly known in its every pace that with watches in their hands men time his rate as doctors that of a babys pulse and lightly say of it the up train or the down train will reach such or such a spot at such or such an hour even so almost there are occasions when these nantucketers time that other leviathan of the deep according to the observed humor of his speed and say to themselves so many hours hence this whale will have gone two hundred miles will have about reached this or that degree of latitude or longitude but to render this acuteness at all successful in the end the wind and the sea must be the whalemans allies for of what present avail to the becalmed or windbound mariner is the skill that assures him he is exactly ninetythree leagues and a quarter from his port inferable from these statements are many collateral subtile matters touching the chase of whales ,MobyDick or The Whale
by salt and hemp cried stubb but this swift motion of the deck creeps up ones legs and tingles at the heart this ship and i are two brave fellowsha ha some one take me up and launch me spinewise on the seafor by liveoaks my spines a keel ha ha we go the gait that leaves no dust behind ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye aye cried stubb i knew itye cant escapeblow on and split your spout o whale the mad fiend himself is after ye blow your trumpblister your lungsahab will dam off your blood as a miller shuts his watergate upon the stream ,MobyDick or The Whale
and stubb did but speak out for well nigh all that crew the frenzies of the chase had by this time worked them bubblingly up like old wine worked anew whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of ahab but they were broken up and on all sides routed as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison the hand of fate had snatched all their souls and by the stirring perils of the previous day the rack of the past nights suspense the fixed unfearing blind reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark by all these things their hearts were bowled along the wind that made great bellies of their sails and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race ,MobyDick or The Whale
they were one man not thirty for as the one ship that held them all though it was put together of all contrasting thingsoak and maple and pine wood iron and pitch and hempyet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull which shot on its way both balanced and directed by the long central keel even so all the individualities of the crew this mans valor that mans fear guilt and guiltiness all varieties were welded into oneness and were all directed to that fatal goal which ahab their one lord and keel did point to ,MobyDick or The Whale
the rigging lived the mastheads like the tops of tall palms were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs clinging to a spar with one hand some reached forth the other with impatient wavings others shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight sat far out on the rocking yards all the spars in full bearing of mortals ready and ripe for their fate ah how they still strove through that infinite blueness to seek out the thing that might destroy them ,MobyDick or The Whale
why sing ye not out for him if ye see him cried ahab when after the lapse of some minutes since the first cry no more had been heard sway me up men ye have been deceived not moby dick casts one odd jet that way and then disappears ,MobyDick or The Whale
it was even so in their headlong eagerness the men had mistaken some other thing for the whalespout as the event itself soon proved for hardly had ahab reached his perch hardly was the rope belayed to its pin on deck when he struck the keynote to an orchestra that made the air vibrate as with the combined discharges of rifles the triumphant halloo of thirty buckskin lungs was heard asmuch nearer to the ship than the place of the imaginary jet less than a mile aheadmoby dick bodily burst into view for not by any calm and indolent spoutings not by the peaceable gush of that mystic fountain in his head did the white whale now reveal his vicinity but by the far more wondrous phenomenon of breaching rising with his utmost velocity from the furthest depths the sperm whale thus booms his entire bulk into the pure element of air and piling up a mountain of dazzling foam shows his place to the distance of seven miles and more in those moments the torn enraged waves he shakes off seem his mane in some cases this breaching is his act of defiance ,MobyDick or The Whale
there she breaches there she breaches was the cry as in his immeasurable bravadoes the white whale tossed himself salmonlike to heaven so suddenly seen in the blue plain of the sea and relieved against the still bluer margin of the sky the spray that he raised for the moment intolerably glittered and glared like a glacier and stood there gradually fading and fading away from its first sparkling intensity to the dim mistiness of an advancing shower in a vale ,MobyDick or The Whale
unmindful of the tedious ropeladders of the shrouds the men like shooting stars slid to the deck by the isolated backstays and halyards while ahab less dartingly but still rapidly was dropped from his perch ,MobyDick or The Whale
as if to strike a quick terror into them by this time being the first assailant himself moby dick had turned and was now coming for the three crews ahabs boat was central and cheering his men he told them he would take the whale headandheadthat is pull straight up to his foreheada not uncommon thing for when within a certain limit such a course excludes the coming onset from the whales sidelong vision but ere that close limit was gained and while yet all three boats were plain as the ships three masts to his eye the white whale churning himself into furious speed almost in an instant as it were rushing among the boats with open jaws and a lashing tail offered appalling battle on every side and heedless of the irons darted at him from every boat seemed only intent on annihilating each separate plank of which those boats were made but skilfully manuvred incessantly wheeling like trained chargers in the field the boats for a while eluded him though at times but by a planks breadth while all the time ahabs unearthly slogan tore every other cry but his to shreds ,MobyDick or The Whale
but at last in his untraceable evolutions the white whale so crossed and recrossed and in a thousand ways entangled the slack of the three lines now fast to him that they foreshortened and of themselves warped the devoted boats towards the planted irons in him though now for a moment the whale drew aside a little as if to rally for a more tremendous charge seizing that opportunity ahab first paid out more line and then was rapidly hauling and jerking in upon it againhoping that way to disencumber it of some snarlswhen loa sight more savage than the embattled teeth of sharks ,MobyDick or The Whale
caught and twistedcorkscrewed in the mazes of the line loose harpoons and lances with all their bristling barbs and points came flashing and dripping up to the chocks in the bows of ahabs boat only one thing could be done seizing the boatknife he critically reached withinthroughand then withoutthe rays of steel dragged in the line beyond passed it inboard to the bowsman and then twice sundering the rope near the chocksdropped the intercepted fagot of steel into the sea and was all fast again that instant the white whale made a sudden rush among the remaining tangles of the other lines by so doing irresistibly dragged the more involved boats of stubb and flask towards his flukes dashed them together like two rolling husks on a surfbeaten beach and then diving down into the sea disappeared in a boiling maelstrom in which for a space the odorous cedar chips of the wrecks danced round and round like the grated nutmeg in a swiftly stirred bowl of punch ,MobyDick or The Whale
while the two crews were yet circling in the waters reaching out after the revolving linetubs oars and other floating furniture while aslope little flask bobbed up and down like an empty vial twitching his legs upwards to escape the dreaded jaws of sharks and stubb was lustily singing out for some one to ladle him up and while the old mans linenow partingadmitted of his pulling into the creamy pool to rescue whom he couldin that wild simultaneousness of a thousand concreted perilsahabs yet unstricken boat seemed drawn up towards heaven by invisible wiresas arrowlike shooting perpendicularly from the sea the white whale dashed his broad forehead against its bottom and sent it turning over and over into the air till it fell againgunwale downwardsand ahab and his men struggled out from under it like seals from a seaside cave ,MobyDick or The Whale
the first uprising momentum of the whalemodifying its direction as he struck the surfaceinvoluntarily launched him along it to a little distance from the centre of the destruction he had made and with his back to it he now lay for a moment slowly feeling with his flukes from side to side and whenever a stray oar bit of plank the least chip or crumb of the boats touched his skin his tail swiftly drew back and came sideways smiting the sea but soon as if satisfied that his work for that time was done he pushed his pleated forehead through the ocean and trailing after him the intertangled lines continued his leeward way at a travellers methodic pace ,MobyDick or The Whale
as before the attentive ship having descried the whole fight again came bearing down to the rescue and dropping a boat picked up the floating mariners tubs oars and whatever else could be caught at and safely landed them on her decks some sprained shoulders wrists and ankles livid contusions wrenched harpoons and lances inextricable intricacies of rope shattered oars and planks all these were there but no fatal or even serious ill seemed to have befallen any one as with fedallah the day before so ahab was now found grimly clinging to his boats broken half which afforded a comparatively easy float nor did it so exhaust him as the previous days mishap ,MobyDick or The Whale
but when he was helped to the deck all eyes were fastened upon him as instead of standing by himself he still halfhung upon the shoulder of starbuck who had thus far been the foremost to assist him his ivory leg had been snapped off leaving but one short sharp splinter ,MobyDick or The Whale
aye and all splintered to pieces stubbdye see itbut even with a broken bone old ahab is untouched and i account no living bone of mine one jot more me than this dead one thats lost nor white whale nor man nor fiend can so much as graze old ahab in his own proper and inaccessible being can any lead touch yonder floor any mast scrape yonder roofaloft there which way ,MobyDick or The Whale
my line my line gonegone what means that little wordwhat deathknell rings in it that old ahab shakes as if he were the belfry the harpoon tootoss over the litter theredye see itthe forged iron men the white whalesno no noblistered fool this hand did dart ittis in the fishaloft there keep him nailedquickall hands to the rigging of the boatscollect the oarsharpooneers the irons the ironshoist the royals highera pull on all the sheetshelm there steady steady for your life ill ten times girdle the unmeasured globe yea and dive straight through it but ill slay him yet ,MobyDick or The Whale
great god but for one single instant show thyself cried starbuck never never wilt thou capture him old manin jesus name no more of this thats worse than devils madness two days chased twice stove to splinters thy very leg once more snatched from under thee thy evil shadow goneall good angels mobbing thee with warningswhat more wouldst thou haveshall we keep chasing this murderous fish till he swamps the last man shall we be dragged by him to the bottom of the sea shall we be towed by him to the infernal world oh ohimpiety and blasphemy to hunt him more ,MobyDick or The Whale
starbuck of late ive felt strangely moved to thee ever since that hour we both sawthou knowst what in one anothers eyes but in this matter of the whale be the front of thy face to me as the palm of this handa lipless unfeatured blank ahab is for ever ahab man this whole acts immutably decreed twas rehearsed by thee and me a billion years before this ocean rolled fool i am the fates lieutenant i act under orders look thou underling that thou obeyest minestand round me men ye see an old man cut down to the stump leaning on a shivered lance propped up on a lonely foot tis ahabhis bodys part but ahabs souls a centipede that moves upon a hundred legs i feel strained half stranded as ropes that tow dismasted frigates in a gale and i may look so but ere i break yell hear me crack and till ye hear that know that ahabs hawser tows his purpose yet believe ye men in the things called omens then laugh aloud and cry encore for ere they drown drowning things will twice rise to the surface then rise again to sink for evermore so with moby dicktwo days hes floatedtomorrow will be the third aye men hell rise once morebut only to spout his last dye feel brave men brave ,MobyDick or The Whale
and as mechanical muttered ahab then as the men went forward he muttered on the things called omens and yesterday i talked the same to starbuck there concerning my broken boat oh how valiantly i seek to drive out of others hearts whats clinched so fast in minethe parseethe parseegone gone and he was to go beforebut still was to be seen again ere i could perishhows thattheres a riddle now might baffle all the lawyers backed by the ghosts of the whole line of judgeslike a hawks beak it pecks my brain ill ill solve it though ,MobyDick or The Whale
so once more the sail was shortened and everything passed nearly as on the previous night only the sound of hammers and the hum of the grindstone was heard till nearly daylight as the men toiled by lanterns in the complete and careful rigging of the spare boats and sharpening their fresh weapons for the morrow meantime of the broken keel of ahabs wrecked craft the carpenter made him another leg while still as on the night before slouched ahab stood fixed within his scuttle his hid heliotrope glance anticipatingly gone backward on its dial sat due eastward for the earliest sun ,MobyDick or The Whale
in his infallible wake though but follow that wake thats all helm there steady as thou goest and hast been going what a lovely day again were it a newmade world and made for a summerhouse to the angels and this morning the first of its throwing open to them a fairer day could not dawn upon that world heres food for thought had ahab time to think but ahab never thinks he only feels feels feels thats tingling enough for mortal man to thinks audacity god only has that right and privilege thinking is or ought to be a coolness and a calmness and our poor hearts throb and our poor brains beat too much for that and yet ive sometimes thought my brain was very calmfrozen calm this old skull cracks so like a glass in which the contents turned to ice and shiver it and still this hair is growing now this moment growing and heat must breed it but no its like that sort of common grass that will grow anywhere between the earthy clefts of greenland ice or in vesuvius lava how the wild winds blow it they whip it about me as the torn shreds of split sails lash the tossed ship they cling to a vile wind that has no doubt blown ere this through prison corridors and cells and wards of hospitals and ventilated them and now comes blowing hither as innocent as fleeces out upon itits tainted were i the wind id blow no more on such a wicked miserable world id crawl somewhere to a cave and slink there and yet tis a noble and heroic thing the wind who ever conquered it in every fight it has the last and bitterest blow run tilting at it and you but run through it ha a coward wind that strikes stark naked men but will not stand to receive a single blow even ahab is a braver thinga nobler thing than that would now the wind but had a body but all the things that most exasperate and outrage mortal man all these things are bodiless but only bodiless as objects not as agents theres a most special a most cunning oh a most malicious difference and yet i say again and swear it now that theres something all glorious and gracious in the wind these warm trade winds at least that in the clear heavens blow straight on in strong and steadfast vigorous mildness and veer not from their mark however the baser currents of the sea may turn and tack and mightiest mississippies of the land swift and swerve about uncertain where to go at last and by the eternal poles these same trades that so directly blow my good ship on these trades or something like themsomething so unchangeable and full as strong blow my keeled soul along to it aloft there what dye see ,MobyDick or The Whale
nothing and noon at hand the doubloon goes abegging see the sun aye aye it must be so ive oversailed him how got the start aye hes chasing me now not i himthats bad i might have known it too fool the linesthe harpoons hes towing aye aye i have run him by last night about about come down all of ye but the regular look outs man the braces ,MobyDick or The Whale
steering as she had done the wind had been somewhat on the pequods quarter so that now being pointed in the reverse direction the braced ship sailed hard upon the breeze as she rechurned the cream in her own white wake ,MobyDick or The Whale
against the wind he now steers for the open jaw murmured starbuck to himself as he coiled the newhauled mainbrace upon the rail god keep us but already my bones feel damp within me and from the inside wet my flesh i misdoubt me that i disobey my god in obeying him ,MobyDick or The Whale
a whole hour now passed goldbeaten out to ages time itself now held long breaths with keen suspense but at last some three points off the weather bow ahab descried the spout again and instantly from the three mastheads three shrieks went up as if the tongues of fire had voiced it ,MobyDick or The Whale
forehead to forehead i meet thee this third time moby dick on deck therebrace sharper up crowd her into the winds eye hes too far off to lower yet mr starbuck the sails shake stand over that helmsman with a topmaul so so he travels fast and i must down but let me have one more good round look aloft here at the sea theres time for that an old old sight and yet somehow so young aye and not changed a wink since i first saw it a boy from the sandhills of nantucket the samethe samethe same to noah as to me theres a soft shower to leeward such lovely leewardings they must lead somewhereto something else than common land more palmy than the palms leeward the white whale goes that way look to windward then the better if the bitterer quarter but good bye good bye old masthead whats thisgreen aye tiny mosses in these warped cracks no such green weather stains on ahabs head theres the difference now between mans old age and matters but aye old mast we both grow old together sound in our hulls though are we not my ship aye minus a leg thats all by heaven this dead wood has the better of my live flesh every way i cant compare with it and ive known some ships made of dead trees outlast the lives of men made of the most vital stuff of vital fathers whats that he said he should still go before me my pilot and yet to be seen again but where will i have eyes at the bottom of the sea supposing i descend those endless stairs and all night ive been sailing from him wherever he did sink to aye aye like many more thou toldst direful truth as touching thyself o parsee but ahab there thy shot fell short goodbye mastheadkeep a good eye upon the whale the while im gone well talk tomorrow nay tonight when the white whale lies down there tied by head and tail ,MobyDick or The Whale
yet the voice spake true for scarce had he pushed from the ship when numbers of sharks seemingly rising from out the dark waters beneath the hull maliciously snapped at the blades of the oars every time they dipped in the water and in this way accompanied the boat with their bites it is a thing not uncommonly happening to the whaleboats in those swarming seas the sharks at times apparently following them in the same prescient way that vultures hover over the banners of marching regiments in the east but these were the first sharks that had been observed by the pequod since the white whale had been first descried and whether it was that ahabs crew were all such tigeryellow barbarians and therefore their flesh more musky to the senses of the sharksa matter sometimes well known to affect themhowever it was they seemed to follow that one boat without molesting the others ,MobyDick or The Whale
heart of wrought steel murmured starbuck gazing over the side and following with his eyes the receding boatcanst thou yet ring boldly to that sightlowering thy keel among ravening sharks and followed by them openmouthed to the chase and this the critical third dayfor when three days flow together in one continuous intense pursuit be sure the first is the morning the second the noon and the third the evening and the end of that thingbe that end what it may oh my god what is this that shoots through me and leaves me so deadly calm yet expectantfixed at the top of a shudder future things swim before me as in empty outlines and skeletons all the past is somehow grown dim mary girl thou fadest in pale glories behind me boy i seem to see but thy eyes grown wondrous blue strangest problems of life seem clearing but clouds sweep betweenis my journeys end coming my legs feel faint like his who has footed it all day feel thy heartbeats it yet stir thyself starbuckstave it offmove move speak aloudmasthead there see ye my boys hand on the hillcrazedaloft therekeep thy keenest eye upon the boatsmark well the whaleho againdrive off that hawk see he peckshe tears the vanepointing to the red flag flying at the maintruckha he soars away with itwheres the old man now seest thou that sight oh ahabshudder shudder ,MobyDick or The Whale
the boats had not gone very far when by a signal from the mastheadsa downward pointed arm ahab knew that the whale had sounded but intending to be near him at the next rising he held on his way a little sideways from the vessel the becharmed crew maintaining the profoundest silence as the headbeat waves hammered and hammered against the opposing bow ,MobyDick or The Whale
suddenly the waters around them slowly swelled in broad circles then quickly upheaved as if sideways sliding from a submerged berg of ice swiftly rising to the surface a low rumbling sound was heard a subterraneous hum and then all held their breaths as bedraggled with trailing ropes and harpoons and lances a vast form shot lengthwise but obliquely from the sea shrouded in a thin drooping veil of mist it hovered for a moment in the rainbowed air and then fell swamping back into the deep crushed thirty feet upwards the waters flashed for an instant like heaps of fountains then brokenly sank in a shower of flakes leaving the circling surface creamed like new milk round the marble trunk of the whale ,MobyDick or The Whale
give way cried ahab to the oarsmen and the boats darted forward to the attack but maddened by yesterdays fresh irons that corroded in him moby dick seemed combinedly possessed by all the angels that fell from heaven the wide tiers of welded tendons overspreading his broad white forehead beneath the transparent skin looked knitted together as head on he came churning his tail among the boats and once more flailed them apart spilling out the irons and lances from the two mates boats and dashing in one side of the upper part of their bows but leaving ahabs almost without a scar ,MobyDick or The Whale
while daggoo and queequeg were stopping the strained planks and as the whale swimming out from them turned and showed one entire flank as he shot by them again at that moment a quick cry went up lashed round and round to the fishs back pinioned in the turns upon turns in which during the past night the whale had reeled the involutions of the lines around him the half torn body of the parsee was seen his sable raiment frayed to shreds his distended eyes turned full upon old ahab ,MobyDick or The Whale
befooled befooleddrawing in a long lean breathaye parsee i see thee againaye and thou goest before and this this then is the hearse that thou didst promise but i hold thee to the last letter of thy word where is the second hearse away mates to the ship those boats are useless now repair them if ye can in time and return to me if not ahab is enough to diedown men the first thing that but offers to jump from this boat i stand in that thing i harpoon ye are not other men but my arms and my legs and so obey mewheres the whale gone down again ,MobyDick or The Whale
but he looked too nigh the boat for as if bent upon escaping with the corpse he bore and as if the particular place of the last encounter had been but a stage in his leeward voyage moby dick was now again steadily swimming forward and had almost passed the shipwhich thus far had been sailing in the contrary direction to him though for the present her headway had been stopped he seemed swimming with his utmost velocity and now only intent upon pursuing his own straight path in the sea ,MobyDick or The Whale
setting sail to the rising wind the lonely boat was swiftly impelled to leeward by both oars and canvas and at last when ahab was sliding by the vessel so near as plainly to distinguish starbucks face as he leaned over the rail he hailed him to turn the vessel about and follow him not too swiftly at a judicious interval glancing upwards he saw tashtego queequeg and daggoo eagerly mounting to the three mastheads while the oarsmen were rocking in the two staved boats which had but just been hoisted to the side and were busily at work in repairing them one after the other through the portholes as he sped he also caught flying glimpses of stubb and flask busying themselves on deck among bundles of new irons and lances as he saw all this as he heard the hammers in the broken boats far other hammers seemed driving a nail into his heart but he rallied and now marking that the vane or flag was gone from the mainmasthead he shouted to tashtego who had just gained that perch to descend again for another flag and a hammer and nails and so nail it to the mast ,MobyDick or The Whale
whether fagged by the three days running chase and the resistance to his swimming in the knotted hamper he bore or whether it was some latent deceitfulness and malice in him whichever was true the white whales way now began to abate as it seemed from the boat so rapidly nearing him once more though indeed the whales last start had not been so long a one as before and still as ahab glided over the waves the unpitying sharks accompanied him and so pertinaciously stuck to the boat and so continually bit at the plying oars that the blades became jagged and crunched and left small splinters in the sea at almost every dip ,MobyDick or The Whale
they will last long enough pull onbut who can tellhe mutteredwhether these sharks swim to feast on the whale or on ahabbut pull on aye all alive nowwe near him the helm take the helm let me passand so saying two of the oarsmen helped him forward to the bows of the still flying boat ,MobyDick or The Whale
at length as the craft was cast to one side and ran ranging along with the white whales flank he seemed strangely oblivious of its advanceas the whale sometimes willand ahab was fairly within the smoky mountain mist which thrown off from the whales spout curled round his great monadnock hump he was even thus close to him when with body arched back and both arms lengthwise highlifted to the poise he darted his fierce iron and his far fiercer curse into the hated whale as both steel and curse sank to the socket as if sucked into a morass moby dick sideways writhed spasmodically rolled his nigh flank against the bow and without staving a hole in it so suddenly canted the boat over that had it not been for the elevated part of the gunwale to which he then clung ahab would once more have been tossed into the sea as it was three of the oarsmenwho foreknew not the precise instant of the dart and were therefore unprepared for its effectsthese were flung out but so fell that in an instant two of them clutched the gunwale again and rising to its level on a combing wave hurled themselves bodily inboard again the third man helplessly dropping astern but still afloat and swimming ,MobyDick or The Whale
almost simultaneously with a mighty volition of ungraduated instantaneous swiftness the white whale darted through the weltering sea but when ahab cried out to the steersman to take new turns with the line and hold it so and commanded the crew to turn round on their seats and tow the boat up to the mark the moment the treacherous line felt that double strain and tug it snapped in the empty air ,MobyDick or The Whale
hearing the tremendous rush of the seacrashing boat the whale wheeled round to present his blank forehead at bay but in that evolution catching sight of the nearing black hull of the ship seemingly seeing in it the source of all his persecutions bethinking itit may bea larger and nobler foe of a sudden he bore down upon its advancing prow smiting his jaws amid fiery showers of foam ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as the oarsmen violently forced their boat through the sledgehammering seas the before whalesmitten bowends of two planks burst through and in an instant almost the temporarily disabled boat lay nearly level with the waves its halfwading splashing crew trying hard to stop the gap and bale out the pouring water ,MobyDick or The Whale
meantime for that one beholding instant tashtegos masthead hammer remained suspended in his hand and the red flag halfwrapping him as with a plaid then streamed itself straight out from him as his own forwardflowing heart while starbuck and stubb standing upon the bowsprit beneath caught sight of the downcoming monster just as soon as he ,MobyDick or The Whale
the whale the whale up helm up helm oh all ye sweet powers of air now hug me close let not starbuck die if die he must in a womans fainting fit up helm i sayye fools the jaw the jaw is this the end of all my bursting prayers all my lifelong fidelities oh ahab ahab lo thy work steady helmsman steady nay nay up helm again he turns to meet us oh his unappeasable brow drives on towards one whose duty tells him he cannot depart my god stand by me now ,MobyDick or The Whale
stand not by me but stand under me whoever you are that will now help stubb for stubb too sticks here i grin at thee thou grinning whale who ever helped stubb or kept stubb awake but stubbs own unwinking eye and now poor stubb goes to bed upon a mattrass that is all too soft would it were stuffed with brushwood i grin at thee thou grinning whale look ye sun moon and stars i call ye assassins of as good a fellow as ever spouted up his ghost for all that i would yet ring glasses with ye would ye but hand the cup oh oh oh oh thou grinning whale but therell be plenty of gulping soon why fly ye not o ahab for me off shoes and jacket to it let stubb die in his drawers a most mouldy and over salted death thoughcherries cherries cherries oh flask for one red cherry ere we die ,MobyDick or The Whale
from the ships bows nearly all the seamen now hung inactive hammers bits of plank lances and harpoons mechanically retained in their hands just as they had darted from their various employments all their enchanted eyes intent upon the whale which from side to side strangely vibrating his predestinating head sent a broad band of overspreading semicircular foam before him as he rushed retribution swift vengeance eternal malice were in his whole aspect and spite of all that mortal man could do the solid white buttress of his forehead smote the ships starboard bow till men and timbers reeled some fell flat upon their faces like dislodged trucks the heads of the harpooneers aloft shook on their bulllike necks through the breach they heard the waters pour as mountain torrents down a flume ,MobyDick or The Whale
diving beneath the settling ship the whale ran quivering along its keel but turning under water swiftly shot to the surface again far off the other bow but within a few yards of ahabs boat where for a time he lay quiescent ,MobyDick or The Whale
i turn my body from the sun what ho tashtego let me hear thy hammer oh ye three unsurrendered spires of mine thou uncracked keel and only godbullied hull thou firm deck and haughty helm and polepointed prowdeathglorious ship must ye then perish and without me am i cut off from the last fond pride of meanest shipwrecked captains oh lonely death on lonely life oh now i feel my topmost greatness lies in my topmost grief ho ho from all your furthest bounds pour ye now in ye bold billows of my whole foregone life and top this one piled comber of my death towards thee i roll thou alldestroying but unconquering whale to the last i grapple with thee from hells heart i stab at thee for hates sake i spit my last breath at thee sink all coffins and all hearses to one common pool and since neither can be mine let me then tow to pieces while still chasing thee though tied to thee thou damned whale thus i give up the spear ,MobyDick or The Whale
the harpoon was darted the stricken whale flew forward with igniting velocity the line ran through the groovesran foul ahab stooped to clear it he did clear it but the flying turn caught him round the neck and voicelessly as turkish mutes bowstring their victim he was shot out of the boat ere the crew knew he was gone next instant the heavy eyesplice in the ropes final end flew out of the starkempty tub knocked down an oarsman and smiting the sea disappeared in its depths ,MobyDick or The Whale
for an instant the tranced boats crew stood still then turned the ship great god where is the ship soon they through dim bewildering mediums saw her sidelong fading phantom as in the gaseous fata morgana only the uppermost masts out of water while fixed by infatuation or fidelity or fate to their once lofty perches the pagan harpooneers still maintained their sinking lookouts on the sea and now concentric circles seized the lone boat itself and all its crew and each floating oar and every lancepole and spinning animate and inanimate all round and round in one vortex carried the smallest chip of the pequod out of sight ,MobyDick or The Whale
but as the last whelmings intermixingly poured themselves over the sunken head of the indian at the mainmast leaving a few inches of the erect spar yet visible together with long streaming yards of the flag which calmly undulated with ironical coincidings over the destroying billows they almost touchedat that instant a red arm and a hammer hovered backwardly uplifted in the open air in the act of nailing the flag faster and yet faster to the subsiding spar a skyhawk that tauntingly had followed the maintruck downwards from its natural home among the stars pecking at the flag and incommoding tashtego there this bird now chanced to intercept its broad fluttering wing between the hammer and the wood and simultaneously feeling that etherial thrill the submerged savage beneath in his deathgasp kept his hammer frozen there and so the bird of heaven with archangelic shrieks and his imperial beak thrust upwards and his whole captive form folded in the flag of ahab went down with his ship which like satan would not sink to hell till she had dragged a living part of heaven along with her and helmeted herself with it ,MobyDick or The Whale
it so chanced that after the parsees disappearance i was he whom the fates ordained to take the place of ahabs bowsman when that bowsman assumed the vacant post the same who when on the last day the three men were tossed from out of the rocking boat was dropped astern so floating on the margin of the ensuing scene and in full sight of it when the halfspent suction of the sunk ship reached me i was then but slowly drawn towards the closing vortex when i reached it it had subsided to a creamy pool round and round then and ever contracting towards the buttonlike black bubble at the axis of that slowly wheeling circle like another ixion i did revolve till gaining that vital centre the black bubble upward burst and now liberated by reason of its cunning spring and owing to its great buoyancy rising with great force the coffin lifebuoy shot lengthwise from the sea fell over and floated by my side buoyed up by that coffin for almost one whole day and night i floated on a soft and dirgelike main the unharming sharks they glided by as if with padlocks on their mouths the savage seahawks sailed with sheathed beaks on the second day a sail drew near nearer and picked me up at last it was the deviouscruising rachel that in her retracing search after her missing children only found another orphan ,MobyDick or The Whale
 may bistritzleft munich at  p m on st may arriving at vienna early next morning should have arrived at  but train was an hour late budapesth seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which i got of it from the train and the little i could walk through the streets i feared to go very far from the station as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible the impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the east the most western of splendid bridges over the danube which is here of noble width and depth took us among the traditions of turkish rule ,Dracula
we left in pretty good time and came after nightfall to klausenburgh here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale i had for dinner or rather supper a chicken done up some way with red pepper which was very good but thirsty mem get recipe for mina i asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika hendl and that as it was a national dish i should be able to get it anywhere along the carpathians i found my smattering of german very useful here indeed i dont know how i should be able to get on without it ,Dracula
having had some time at my disposal when in london i had visited the british museum and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country i find that the district he named is in the extreme east of the country just on the borders of three states transylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathian mountains one of the wildest and least known portions of europe i was not able to light on any map or work giving the exact locality of the castle dracula as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own ordnance survey maps but i found that bistritz the post town named by count dracula is a fairly wellknown place i shall enter here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when i talk over my travels with mina ,Dracula
in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities saxons in the south and mixed with them the wallachs who are the descendants of the dacians magyars in the west and szekelys in the east and north i am going among the latter who claim to be descended from attila and the huns this may be so for when the magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled in it i read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the carpathians as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting mem i must ask the count all about them ,Dracula
i did not sleep well though my bed was comfortable enough for i had all sorts of queer dreams there was a dog howling all night under my window which may have had something to do with it or it may have been the paprika for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe and was still thirsty towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then i had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was mamaliga and eggplant stuffed with forcemeat a very excellent dish which they call impletata mem get recipe for this also i had to hurry breakfast for the train started a little before eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rushing to the station at  i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move it seems to me that the further east you go the more unpunctual are the trains what ought they to be in china ,Dracula
all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in old missals sometimes we ran by rivers and streams which seemed from the wide stony margin on each side of them to be subject to great floods it takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear at every station there were groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sorts of attire some of them were just like the peasants at home or those i saw coming through france and germany with short jackets and round hats and homemade trousers but others were very picturesque the women looked pretty except when you got near them but they were very clumsy about the waist they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet but of course there were petticoats under them the strangest figures we saw were the slovaks who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboy hats great baggy dirtywhite trousers white linen shirts and enormous heavy leather belts nearly a foot wide all studded over with brass nails they wore high boots with their trousers tucked into them and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches they are very picturesque but do not look prepossessing on the stage they would be set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands they are however i am told very harmless and rather wanting in natural selfassertion ,Dracula
it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistritz which is a very interesting old place being practically on the frontierfor the borgo pass leads from it into bukovinait has had a very stormy existence and it certainly shows marks of it fifty years ago a series of great fires took place which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost  people the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease ,Dracula
count dracula had directed me to go to the golden krone hotel which i found to my great delight to be thoroughly oldfashioned for of course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country i was evidently expected for when i got near the door i faced a cheerylooking elderly woman in the usual peasant dresswhite undergarment with long double apron front and back of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty when i came close she bowed and said the herr englishman yes i said jonathan harker she smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirtsleeves who had followed her to the door he went but immediately returned with a letter ,Dracula
my friendwelcome to the carpathians i am anxiously expecting you sleep well tonight at three tomorrow the diligence will start for bukovina a place on it is kept for you at the borgo pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me i trust that your journey from london has been a happy one and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land ,Dracula
 mayi found that my landlord had got a letter from the count directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on making inquiries as to details he seemed somewhat reticent and pretended that he could not understand my german this could not be true because up to then he had understood it perfectly at least he answered my questions exactly as if he did he and his wife the old lady who had received me looked at each other in a frightened sort of way he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and that was all he knew when i asked him if he knew count dracula and could tell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed themselves and saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speak further it was so near the time of starting that i had no time to ask any one else for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting ,Dracula
must you go oh young herr must you go she was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew and mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all i was just able to follow her by asking many questions when i told her that i must go at once and that i was engaged on important business she asked again ,Dracula
it is the eve of st georges day do you not know that tonight when the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have full sway do you know where you are going and what you are going to she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her but without effect finally she went down on her knees and implored me not to go at least to wait a day or two before starting it was all very ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable however there was business to be done and i could allow nothing to interfere with it i therefore tried to raise her up and said as gravely as i could that i thanked her but my duty was imperative and that i must go she then rose and dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me i did not know what to do for as an english churchman i have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind she saw i suppose the doubt in my face for she put the rosary round my neck and said for your mothers sake and went out of the room i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting for the coach which is of course late and the crucifix is still round my neck whether it is the old ladys fear or the many ghostly traditions of this place or the crucifix itself i do not know but i am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual if this book should ever reach mina before i do let it bring my goodbye here comes the coach ,Dracula
 may the castlethe grey of the morning has passed and the sun is high over the distant horizon which seems jagged whether with trees or hills i know not for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed i am not sleepy and as i am not to be called till i awake naturally i write till sleep comes there are many odd things to put down and lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i left bistritz let me put down my dinner exactly i dined on what they called robber steakbits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with red pepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simple style of the london cats meat the wine was golden mediasch which produces a queer sting on the tongue which is however not disagreeable i had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing else ,Dracula
when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and i saw him talking with the landlady they were evidently talking of me for every now and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the doorwhich they call by a name meaning wordbearercame and listened and then looked at me most of them pityingly i could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words for there were many nationalities in the crowd so i quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out i must say they were not cheering to me for amongst them were ordogsatan pokolhell stregoicawitch vrolok and vlkoslakboth of which mean the same thing one being slovak and the other servian for something that is either werewolf or vampire mem i must ask the count about these superstitions ,Dracula
when we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this time swelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me with some difficulty i got a fellowpassenger to tell me what they meant he would not answer at first but on learning that i was english he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye this was not very pleasant for me just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man but every one seemed so kindhearted and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that i could not but be touched i shall never forget the last glimpse which i had of the innyard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossing themselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard then our driver whose wide linen drawers covered the whole front of the boxseatgotza they call themcracked his big whip over his four small horses which ran abreast and we set off on our journey ,Dracula
i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along although had i known the language or rather languages which my fellowpassengers were speaking i might not have been able to throw them off so easily before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to the road there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossomapple plum pear cherry and as we drove by i could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals in and out amongst these green hills of what they call here the mittel land ran the road losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame the road was rugged but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste i could not understand then what the haste meant but the driver was evidently bent on losing no time in reaching borgo prund i was told that this road is in summertime excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order of old the hospadars would not repair them lest the turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point ,Dracula
beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steeps of the carpathians themselves right and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed crags till these were themselves lost in the distance where the snowy peaks rose grandly here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sun began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water one of my companions touched my arm as we swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snowcovered peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before us ,Dracula
as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us this was emphasised by the fact that the snowy mountaintop still held the sunset and seemed to glow out with a delicate cool pink here and there we passed cszeks and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent by the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves here and there was a peasant man or woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the selfsurrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor ears for the outer world there were many things new to me for instance hayricks in the trees and here and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves now and again we passed a leiterwagonthe ordinary peasants cartwith its long snakelike vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of the road on this were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants the cszeks with their white and the slovaks with their coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lancefashion their long staves with axe at end as the evening fell it began to get very cold and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mistiness the gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the pass the dark firs stood out here and there against the background of latelying snow sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of greyness which here and there bestrewed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghostlike clouds which amongst the carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our drivers haste the horses could only go slowly i wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it no no he said you must not walk here the dogs are too fierce and then he added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantryfor he looked round to catch the approving smile of the restand you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep the only stop he would make was a moments pause to light his lamps ,Dracula
when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers and they kept speaking to him one after the other as though urging him to further speed he lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them on to further exertions then through the darkness i could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in the hills the excitement of the passengers grew greater the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea i had to hold on the road grew more level and we appeared to fly along then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us we were entering on the borgo pass one by one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial these were certainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple good faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that strange mixture of fearmeaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at bistritzthe sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye then as we flew along the driver leaned forward and on each side the passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkness it was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected but though i asked each passenger no one would give me the slightest explanation this state of excitement kept on for some little time and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on the eastern side there were dark rolling clouds overhead and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder it seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had got into the thunderous one i was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the count each moment i expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark the only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from our harddriven horses rose in a white cloud we could see now the sandy road lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehicle the passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock my own disappointment i was already thinking what i had best do when the driver looking at his watch said to the others something which i could hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in so low a tone i thought it was an hour less than the time then turning to me he said in german worse than my own ,Dracula
there is no carriage here the herr is not expected after all he will now come on to bukovina and return tomorrow or the next day better the next day whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and snort and plunge wildly so that the driver had to hold them up then amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves a calche with four horses drove up behind us overtook us and drew up beside the coach i could see from the flash of our lamps as the rays fell on them that the horses were coalblack and splendid animals they were driven by a tall man with a long brown beard and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us i could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes which seemed red in the lamplight as he turned to us he said to the driver ,Dracula
that is why i suppose you wished him to go on to bukovina you cannot deceive me my friend i know too much and my horses are swift as he spoke he smiled and the lamplight fell on a hardlooking mouth with very red lips and sharplooking teeth as white as ivory one of my companions whispered to another the line from burgers lenore ,Dracula
the strange driver evidently heard the words for he looked up with a gleaming smile the passenger turned his face away at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself give me the herrs luggage said the driver and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the calche then i descended from the side of the coach as the calche was close alongside the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel his strength must have been prodigious without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and we swept into the darkness of the pass as i looked back i saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses and off they swept on their way to bukovina as they sank into the darkness i felt a strange chill and a lonely feeling came over me but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders and a rug across my knees and the driver said in excellent german ,Dracula
the night is chill mein herr and my master the count bade me take all care of you there is a flask of slivovitz the plum brandy of the country underneath the seat if you should require it i did not take any but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same i felt a little strangely and not a little frightened i think had there been any alternative i should have taken it instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey the carriage went at a hard pace straight along then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road it seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again and so i took note of some salient point and found that this was so i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but i really feared to do so for i thought that placed as i was any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay byandby however as i was curious to know how time was passing i struck a match and by its flame looked at my watch it was within a few minutes of midnight this gave me a sort of shock for i suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences i waited with a sick feeling of suspense ,Dracula
then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the roada long agonised wailing as if from fear the sound was taken up by another dog and then another and another till borne on the wind which now sighed softly through the pass a wild howling began which seemed to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night at the first howl the horses began to strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieted down but shivered and sweated as though after a runaway from sudden fright then far off in the distance from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howlingthat of wolveswhich affected both the horses and myself in the same wayfor i was minded to jump from the calche and run whilst they reared again and plunged madly so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from bolting in a few minutes however my own ears got accustomed to the sound and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them he petted and soothed them and whispered something in their ears as i have heard of horsetamers doing and with extraordinary effect for under his caresses they became quite manageable again though they still trembled the driver again took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace this time after going to the far side of the pass he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right ,Dracula
soon we were hemmed in with trees which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side though we were in shelter we could hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through the rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along it grew colder and colder still and fine powdery snow began to fall so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket the keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs though this grew fainter as we went on our way the baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer as though they were closing round on us from every side i grew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear the driver however was not in the least disturbed he kept turning his head to left and right but i could not see anything through the darkness ,Dracula
suddenly away on our left i saw a faint flickering blue flame the driver saw it at the same moment he at once checked the horses and jumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness i did not know what to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer but while i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took his seat and we resumed our journey i think i must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeated endlessly and now looking back it is like a sort of awful nightmare once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us i could watch the drivers motions he went rapidly to where the blue flame aroseit must have been very faint for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at alland gathering a few stones formed them into some device once there appeared a strange optical effect when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it for i could see its ghostly flicker all the same this startled me but as the effect was only momentary i took it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness then for a time there were no blue flames and we sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of the wolves around us as though they were following in a moving circle ,Dracula
at last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright i could not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a beetling pineclad rock and by its light i saw around us a ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongues with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair they were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled for myself i felt a sort of paralysis of fear it is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import ,Dracula
all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them the horses jumped about and reared and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side and they had perforce to remain within it i called to the coachman to come for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach i shouted and beat the side of the calche hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from that side so as to give him a chance of reaching the trap how he came there i know not but i heard his voice raised in a tone of imperious command and looking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway as he swept his long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves fell back and back further still just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness ,Dracula
when i could see again the driver was climbing into the calche and the wolves had disappeared this was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me and i was afraid to speak or move the time seemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon we kept on ascending with occasional periods of quick descent but in the main always ascending suddenly i became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came no ray of light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the moonlit sky ,Dracula
 mayi must have been asleep for certainly if i had been fully awake i must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place in the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is i have not yet been able to see it by daylight ,Dracula
when the calche stopped the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight again i could not but notice his prodigious strength his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen then he took out my traps and placed them on the ground beside me as i stood close to a great door old and studded with large iron nails and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone i could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather as i stood the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings ,Dracula
i stood in silence where i was for i did not know what to do of bell or knocker there was no sign through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate the time i waited seemed endless and i felt doubts and fears crowding upon me what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of people what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked was this a customary incident in the life of a solicitors clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner solicitors clerk mina would not like that solicitorfor just before leaving london i got word that my examination was successful and i am now a fullblown solicitor i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if i were awake it all seemed like a horrible nightmare to me and i expected that i should suddenly awake and find myself at home with the dawn struggling in through the windows as i had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork but my flesh answered the pinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived i was indeed awake and among the carpathians all i could do now was to be patient and to wait the coming of the morning ,Dracula
just as i had come to this conclusion i heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light then there was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back a key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse and the great door swung back ,Dracula
within stood a tall old man clean shaven save for a long white moustache and clad in black from head to foot without a single speck of colour about him anywhere he held in his hand an antique silver lamp in which the flame burned without chimney or globe of any kind throwing long quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door the old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture saying in excellent english but with a strange intonation ,Dracula
welcome to my house enter freely and of your own will he made no motion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone the instant however that i had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed as cold as icemore like the hand of a dead than a living man again he said ,Dracula
welcome to my house come freely go safely and leave something of the happiness you bring the strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which i had noticed in the driver whose face i had not seen that for a moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was speaking so to make sure i said interrogatively ,Dracula
i am dracula and i bid you welcome mr harker to my house come in the night air is chill and you must need to eat and rest as he was speaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping out took my luggage he had carried it in before i could forestall him i protested but he insisted ,Dracula
nay sir you are my guest it is late and my people are not available let me see to your comfort myself he insisted on carrying my traps along the passage and then up a great winding stair and along another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily at the end of this he threw open a heavy door and i rejoiced to see within a welllit room in which a table was spread for supper and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenished flamed and flared ,Dracula
the count halted putting down my bags closed the door and crossing the room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort passing through this he opened another door and motioned me to enter it was a welcome sight for here was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log firealso added to but lately for the top logs were freshwhich sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney the count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed the door ,Dracula
the light and warmth and the counts courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears having then reached my normal state i discovered that i was half famished with hunger so making a hasty toilet i went into the other room ,Dracula
i handed to him the sealed letter which mr hawkins had entrusted to me he opened it and read it gravely then with a charming smile he handed it to me to read one passage of it at least gave me a thrill of pleasure ,Dracula
i must regret that an attack of gout from which malady i am a constant sufferer forbids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come but i am happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute one in whom i have every possible confidence he is a young man full of energy and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition he is discreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service he shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take your instructions in all matters ,Dracula
the count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and i fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken this with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i had two glasses was my supper during the time i was eating it the count asked me many questions as to my journey and i told him by degrees all i had experienced ,Dracula
by this time i had finished my supper and by my hosts desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke i had now an opportunity of observing him and found him of a very marked physiognomy ,Dracula
his face was a stronga very strongaquiline with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere his eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bushy hair that seemed to curl in its own profusion the mouth so far as i could see it under the heavy moustache was fixed and rather cruellooking with peculiarly sharp white teeth these protruded over the lips whose remarkable ruddiness showed astonishing vitality in a man of his years for the rest his ears were pale and at the tops extremely pointed the chin was broad and strong and the cheeks firm though thin the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor ,Dracula
hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight and they had seemed rather white and fine but seeing them now close to me i could not but notice that they were rather coarsebroad with squat fingers strange to say there were hairs in the centre of the palm the nails were long and fine and cut to a sharp point as the count leaned over me and his hands touched me i could not repress a shudder it may have been that his breath was rank but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what i would i could not conceal the count evidently noticing it drew back and with a grim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done his protuberant teeth sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace we were both silent for a while and as i looked towards the window i saw the first dim streak of the coming dawn there seemed a strange stillness over everything but as i listened i heard as if from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves the counts eyes gleamed and he said ,Dracula
but you must be tired your bedroom is all ready and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will i have to be away till the afternoon so sleep well and dream well with a courteous bow he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room and i entered my bedroom ,Dracula
 mayit is again early morning but i have rested and enjoyed the last twentyfour hours i slept till late in the day and awoke of my own accord when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had supped and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hot by the pot being placed on the hearth there was a card on the table on which was written ,Dracula
i have to be absent for a while do not wait for med i set to and enjoyed a hearty meal when i had done i looked for a bell so that i might let the servants know i had finished but i could not find one there are certainly odd deficiencies in the house considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are round me the table service is of gold and so beautifully wrought that it must be of immense value the curtains and upholstery of the chairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed are of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must have been of fabulous value when they were made for they are centuries old though in excellent order i saw something like them in hampton court but there they were worn and frayed and motheaten but still in none of the rooms is there a mirror there is not even a toilet glass on my table and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i could either shave or brush my hair i have not yet seen a servant anywhere or heard a sound near the castle except the howling of wolves some time after i had finished my meali do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner for it was between five and six oclock when i had iti looked about for something to read for i did not like to go about the castle until i had asked the counts permission there was absolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even writing materials so i opened another door in the room and found a sort of library the door opposite mine i tried but found it locked ,Dracula
in the library i found to my great delight a vast number of english books whole shelves full of them and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers a table in the centre was littered with english magazines and newspapers though none of them were of very recent date the books were of the most varied kindhistory geography politics political economy botany geology lawall relating to england and english life and customs and manners there were even such books of reference as the london directory the red and blue books whitakers almanac the army and navy lists andit somehow gladdened my heart to see itthe law list ,Dracula
i am glad you found your way in here for i am sure there is much that will interest you these companionsand he laid his hand on some of the bookshave been good friends to me and for some years past ever since i had the idea of going to london have given me many many hours of pleasure through them i have come to know your great england and to know her is to love her i long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty london to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity to share its life its change its death and all that makes it what it is but alas as yet i only know your tongue through books to you my friend i look that i know it to speak ,Dracula
not so he answered well i know that did i move and speak in your london none there are who would not know me for a stranger that is not enough for me here i am noble i am boyar the common people know me and i am master but a stranger in a strange land he is no one men know him notand to know not is to care not for i am content if i am like the rest so that no man stops if he see me or pause in his speaking if he hear my words ha ha a stranger i have been so long master that i would be master stillor at least that none other should be master of me you come to me not alone as agent of my friend peter hawkins of exeter to tell me all about my new estate in london you shall i trust rest here with me awhile so that by our talking i may learn the english intonation and i would that you tell me when i make error even of the smallest in my speaking i am sorry that i had to be away so long today but you will i know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand ,Dracula
you may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the doors are locked where of course you will not wish to go there is reason that all things are as they are and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge you would perhaps better understand i said i was sure of this and then he went on ,Dracula
we are in transylvania and transylvania is not england our ways are not your ways and there shall be to you many strange things nay from what you have told me of your experiences already you know something of what strange things there may be ,Dracula
this led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted to talk if only for talkings sake i asked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come within my notice sometimes he sheered off the subject or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand but generally he answered all i asked most frankly then as time went on and i had got somewhat bolder i asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for instance why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the yearlast night in fact when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked swaya blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed that treasure has been hidden he went on in the region through which you came last night there can be but little doubt for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the wallachian the saxon and the turk why there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men patriots or invaders in old days there were stirring times when the austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes and the patriots went out to meet themmen and women the aged and the children tooand waited their coming on the rocks above the passes that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches when the invader was triumphant he found but little for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil ,Dracula
but how said i can it have remained so long undiscovered when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look the count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the long sharp canine teeth showed out strangely he answered ,Dracula
because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool those flames only appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if he can help it stir without his doors and dear sir even if he did he would not know what to do why even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work even you would not i dare be sworn be able to find these places again ,Dracula
come he said at last tell me of london and of the house which you have procured for me with an apology for my remissness i went into my own room to get the papers from my bag whilst i was placing them in order i heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room and as i passed through noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit for it was by this time deep into the dark the lamps were also lit in the study or library and i found the count lying on the sofa reading of all things in the world an english bradshaws guide when i came in he cleared the books and papers from the table and with him i went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts he was interested in everything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings he clearly had studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end knew very much more than i did when i remarked this he answered ,Dracula
well but my friend is it not needful that i should when i go there i shall be all alone and my friend harker jonathannay pardon me i fall into my countrys habit of putting your patronymic firstmy friend jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me he will be in exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with my other friend peter hawkins so ,Dracula
we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at purfleet when i had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers and had written a letter with them ready to post to mr hawkins he began to ask me how i had come across so suitable a place i read to him the notes which i had made at the time and which i inscribe here ,Dracula
at purfleet on a byroad i came across just such a place as seemed to be required and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale it is surrounded by a high wall of ancient structure built of heavy stones and has not been repaired for a large number of years the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron all eaten with rust ,Dracula
the estate is called carfax no doubt a corruption of the old quatre face as the house is foursided agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass it contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned there are many trees on it which make it in places gloomy and there is a deep darklooking pond or small lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear and flows away in a fairsized stream the house is very large and of all periods back i should say to medival times for one part is of stone immensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron it looks like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel or church i could not enter it as i had not the key of the door leading to it from the house but i have taken with my kodak views of it from various points the house has been added to but in a very straggling way and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers which must be very great there are but few houses close at hand one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum it is not however visible from the grounds ,Dracula
i am glad that it is old and big i myself am of an old family and to live in a new house would kill me a house cannot be made habitable in a day and after all how few days go to make up a century i rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times we transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead i seek not gaiety nor mirth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay i am no longer young and my heart through weary years of mourning over the dead is not attuned to mirth moreover the walls of my castle are broken the shadows are many and the wind breathes cold through the broken battlements and casements i love the shade and the shadow and would be alone with my thoughts when i may somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturnine ,Dracula
presently with an excuse he left me asking me to put all my papers together he was some little time away and i began to look at some of the books around me one was an atlas which i found opened naturally at england as if that map had been much used on looking at it i found in certain places little rings marked and on examining these i noticed that one was near london on the east side manifestly where his new estate was situated the other two were exeter and whitby on the yorkshire coast ,Dracula
it was the better part of an hour when the count returned aha he said still at your books good but you must not work always come i am informed that your supper is ready he took my arm and we went into the next room where i found an excellent supper ready on the table the count again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away from home but he sat as on the previous night and chatted whilst i ate after supper i smoked as on the last evening and the count stayed with me chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hour after hour i felt that it was getting very late indeed but i did not say anything for i felt under obligation to meet my hosts wishes in every way i was not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tide they say that people who are near death die generally at the change to the dawn or at the turn of the tide any one who has when tired and tied as it were to his post experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it all at once we heard the crow of a cock coming up with preternatural shrillness through the clear morning air count dracula jumping to his feet said ,Dracula
why there is the morning again how remiss i am to let you stay up so long you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of england less interesting so that i may not forget how time flies by us and with a courtly bow he quickly left me ,Dracula
i went into my own room and drew the curtains but there was little to notice my window opened into the courtyard all i could see was the warm grey of quickening sky so i pulled the curtains again and have written of this day ,Dracula
 mayi began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting too diffuse but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that i cannot but feel uneasy i wish i were safe out of it or that i had never come it may be that this strange nightexistence is telling on me but would that that were all if there were any one to talk to i could bear it but there is no one i have only the count to speak with and hei fear i am myself the only living soul within the place let me be prosaic so far as facts can be it will help me to bear up and imagination must not run riot with me if it does i am lost let me say at once how i standor seem to ,Dracula
i only slept a few hours when i went to bed and feeling that i could not sleep any more got up i had hung my shaving glass by the window and was just beginning to shave suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the counts voice saying to me goodmorning i started for it amazed me that i had not seen him since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me in starting i had cut myself slightly but did not notice it at the moment having answered the counts salutation i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken this time there could be no error for the man was close to me and i could see him over my shoulder but there was no reflection of him in the mirror the whole room behind me was displayed but there was no sign of a man in it except myself this was startling and coming on the top of so many strange things was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near but at the instant i saw that the cut had bled a little and the blood was trickling over my chin i laid down the razor turning as i did so half round to look for some sticking plaster when the count saw my face his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab at my throat i drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix it made an instant change in him for the fury passed so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there ,Dracula
take care he said take care how you cut yourself it is more dangerous than you think in this country then seizing the shaving glass he went on and this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief it is a foul bauble of mans vanity away with it and opening the heavy window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flung out the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below then he withdrew without a word it is very annoying for i do not see how i am to shave unless in my watchcase or the bottom of the shavingpot which is fortunately of metal ,Dracula
when i went into the diningroom breakfast was prepared but i could not find the count anywhere so i breakfasted alone it is strange that as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink he must be a very peculiar man after breakfast i did a little exploring in the castle i went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south the view was magnificent and from where i stood there was every opportunity of seeing it the castle is on the very edge of a terrible precipice a stone falling from the window would fall a thousand feet without touching anything as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops with occasionally a deep rift where there is a chasm here and there are silver threads where the rivers wind in deep gorges through the forests ,Dracula
but i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i had seen the view i explored further doors doors doors everywhere and all locked and bolted in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit ,Dracula
when i found that i was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me i rushed up and down the stairs trying every door and peering out of every window i could find but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings when i look back after a few hours i think i must have been mad for the time for i behaved much as a rat does in a trap when however the conviction had come to me that i was helpless i sat down quietlyas quietly as i have ever done anything in my lifeand began to think over what was best to be done i am thinking still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion of one thing only am i certain that it is no use making my ideas known to the count he knows well that i am imprisoned and as he has done it himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive me if i trusted him fully with the facts so far as i can see my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyes open i am i know either being deceived like a baby by my own fears or else i am in desperate straits and if the latter be so i need and shall need all my brains to get through ,Dracula
i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below shut and knew that the count had returned he did not come at once into the library so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed this was odd but only confirmed what i had all along thoughtthat there were no servants in the house when later i saw him through the chink of the hinges of the door laying the table in the diningroom i was assured of it for if he does himself all these menial offices surely it is proof that there is no one else to do them this gave me a fright for if there is no one else in the castle it must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here this is a terrible thought for if so what does it mean that he could control the wolves as he did by only holding up his hand in silence how was it that all the people at bistritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me what meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash bless that good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever i touch it it is odd that a thing which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a medium a tangible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort some time if it may be i must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it in the meantime i must find out all i can about count dracula as it may help me to understand tonight he may talk of himself if i turn the conversation that way i must be very careful however not to awake his suspicion ,Dracula
midnighti have had a long talk with the count i asked him a few questions on transylvania history and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully in his speaking of things and people and especially of battles he spoke as if he had been present at them all this he afterwards explained by saying that to a boyar the pride of his house and name is his own pride that their glory is his glory that their fate is his fate whenever he spoke of his house he always said we and spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking i wish i could put down all he said exactly as he said it for to me it was most fascinating it seemed to have in it a whole history of the country he grew excited as he spoke and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength one thing he said which i shall put down as nearly as i can for it tells in its way the story of his race ,Dracula
we szekelys have a right to be proud for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights for lordship here in the whirlpool of european races the ugric tribe bore down from iceland the fighting spirit which thor and wodin gave them which their berserkers displayed to such fell intent on the seaboards of europe ay and of asia and africa too till the peoples thought that the werewolves themselves had come here too when they came they found the huns whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame till the dying peoples held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches who expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the desert fools fools what devil or what witch was ever so great as attila whose blood is in these veins he held up his arms is it a wonder that we were a conquering race that we were proud that when the magyar the lombard the avar the bulgar or the turk poured his thousands on our frontiers we drove them back is it strange that when arpad and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier that the honfoglalas was completed there and when the hungarian flood swept eastward the szekelys were claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkeyland ay and more than that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the turks say water sleeps and enemy is sleepless who more gladly than we throughout the four nations received the bloody sword or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king when was redeemed that great shame of my nation the shame of cassova when the flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent who was it but one of my own race who as voivode crossed the danube and beat the turk on his own ground this was a dracula indeed woe was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the turk and brought the shame of slavery on them was it not this dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkeyland who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph they said that he thought only of himself bah what good are peasants without a leader where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it again when after the battle of mohcs we threw off the hungarian yoke we of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders for our spirit would not brook that we were not free ah young sir the szekelysand the dracula as their hearts blood their brains and their swordscan boast a record that mushroom growths like the hapsburgs and the romanoffs can never reach the warlike days are over blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace and the glories of the great races are as a tale that is told ,Dracula
it was by this time close on morning and we went to bed mem this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights for everything has to break off at cockcrowor like the ghost of hamlets father ,Dracula
 maylet me begin with factsbare meagre facts verified by books and figures and of which there can be no doubt i must not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation or my memory of them last evening when the count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business i had spent the day wearily over books and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of the matters i had been examining at lincolns inn there was a certain method in the counts inquiries so i shall try to put them down in sequence the knowledge may somehow or some time be useful to me ,Dracula
first he asked if a man in england might have two solicitors or more i told him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as only one could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend say to banking and another to look after shipping in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor i asked him to explain more fully so that i might not by any chance mislead him so he said ,Dracula
i shall illustrate your friend and mine mr peter hawkins from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which is far from london buys for me through your good self my place at london good now here let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that i have sought the services of one so far off from london instead of some one resident there that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only and as one of london residence might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve i went thus afield to seek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest now suppose i who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to newcastle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in these ports i answered that certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placing himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble ,Dracula
good he said and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guarded against i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee for a man who was never in the country and who did not evidently do much in the way of business his knowledge and acumen were wonderful when he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken and i had verified all as well as i could by the books available he suddenly stood up and said ,Dracula
have you written since your first letter to our friend mr peter hawkins or to any other it was with some bitterness in my heart that i answered that i had not that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody ,Dracula
i desire it much nay i will take no refusal when your master employer what you will engaged that someone should come on his behalf it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted i have not stinted is it not so ,Dracula
what could i do but bow acceptance it was mr hawkinss interest not mine and i had to think of him not myself and besides while count dracula was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that i was a prisoner and that if i wished it i could have no choice the count saw his victory in my bow and his mastery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to use them but in his own smooth resistless way ,Dracula
i pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters it will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well and that you look forward to getting home to them is it not so as he spoke he handed me three sheets of notepaper and three envelopes they were all of the thinnest foreign post and looking at them then at him and noticing his quiet smile with the sharp canine teeth lying over the red underlip i understood as well as if he had spoken that i should be careful what i wrote for he would be able to read it so i determined to write only formal notes now but to write fully to mr hawkins in secret and also to mina for to her i could write in shorthand which would puzzle the count if he did see it when i had written my two letters i sat quiet reading a book whilst the count wrote several notes referring as he wrote them to some books on his table then he took up my two and placed them with his own and put by his writing materials after which the instant the door had closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the letters which were face down on the table i felt no compunction in doing so for under the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every way i could ,Dracula
one of the letters was directed to samuel f billington no  the crescent whitby another to herr leutner varna the third was to coutts  co london and the fourth to herren klopstock  billreuth bankers budapesth the second and fourth were unsealed i was just about to look at them when i saw the doorhandle move i sank back in my seat having just had time to replace the letters as they had been and to resume my book before the count holding still another letter in his hand entered the room he took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully and then turning to me said ,Dracula
let me advise you my dear young friendnay let me warn you with all seriousness that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle it is old and has many memories and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely be warned should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms for your rest will then be safe but if you be not careful in this respect thenhe finished his speech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them i quite understood my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me ,Dracula
lateri endorse the last words written but this time there is no doubt in question i shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bedi imagine that my rest is thus freer from dreams and there it shall remain ,Dracula
when he left me i went to my room after a little while not hearing any sound i came out and went up the stone stair to where i could look out towards the south there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse inaccessible though it was to me as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard looking out on this i felt that i was indeed in prison and i seemed to want a breath of fresh air though it were of the night i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence tell on me it is destroying my nerve i start at my own shadow and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings god knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place i looked out over the beautiful expanse bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost as light as day in the soft light the distant hills became melted and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness the mere beauty seemed to cheer me there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew as i leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order of the rooms that the windows of the counts own room would look out the window at which i stood was tall and deep stonemullioned and though weatherworn was still complete but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there i drew back behind the stonework and looked carefully out ,Dracula
what i saw was the counts head coming out from the window i did not see the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had so many opportunities of studying i was at first interested and somewhat amused for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner but my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over that dreadful abyss face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings at first i could not believe my eyes i thought it was some trick of the moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking and it could be no delusion i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by thus using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed just as a lizard moves along a wall ,Dracula
what manner of man is this or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me i am in fearin awful fearand there is no escape for me i am encompassed about with terrors that i dare not think of ,Dracula
 mayonce more have i seen the count go out in his lizard fashion he moved downwards in a sidelong way some hundred feet down and a good deal to the left he vanished into some hole or window when his head had disappeared i leaned out to try and see more but without availthe distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight i knew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than i had dared to do as yet i went back to the room and taking a lamp tried all the doors they were all locked as i had expected and the locks were comparatively new but i went down the stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally i found i could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains but the door was locked and the key was gone that key must be in the counts room i must watch should his door be unlocked so that i may get it and escape i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages and to try the doors that opened from them one or two small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture dusty with age and motheaten at last however i found one door at the top of the stairway which though it seemed to be locked gave a little under pressure i tried it harder and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rested on the floor here was an opportunity which i might not have again so i exerted myself and with many efforts forced it back so that i could enter i was now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms i knew and a storey lower down from the windows i could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle the windows of the end room looking out both west and south on the latter side as well as to the former there was a great precipice the castle was built on the corner of a great rock so that on three sides it was quite impregnable and great windows were placed here where sling or bow or culverin could not reach and consequently light and comfort impossible to a position which had to be guarded were secured to the west was a great valley and then rising far away great jagged mountain fastnesses rising peak on peak the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone this was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had more air of comfort than any i had seen the windows were curtainless and the yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond panes enabled one to see even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay over all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and the moth my lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i was glad to have it with me for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble still it was better than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the presence of the count and after trying a little to school my nerves i found a soft quietude come over me here i am sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady sat to pen with much thought and many blushes her illspelt loveletter and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last it is nineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance and yet unless my senses deceive me the old centuries had and have powers of their own which mere modernity cannot kill ,Dracula
later the morning of  maygod preserve my sanity for to this i am reduced safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for that i may not go mad if indeed i be not mad already if i be sane then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone i can look for safety even though this be only whilst i can serve his purpose great god merciful god let me be calm for out of that way lies madness indeed i begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant when he made hamlet say ,Dracula
when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket i felt sleepy the counts warning came into my mind but i took a pleasure in disobeying it the sense of sleep was upon me and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider the soft moonlight soothed and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me i determined not to return tonight to the gloomhaunted rooms but to sleep here where of old ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars i drew a great couch out of its place near the corner so that as i lay i could look at the lovely view to east and south and unthinking of and uncaring for the dust composed myself for sleep i suppose i must have fallen asleep i hope so but i fear for all that followed was startlingly realso real that now sitting here in the broad full sunlight of the morning i cannot in the least believe that it was all sleep ,Dracula
i was not alone the room was the same unchanged in any way since i came into it i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of dust in the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies by their dress and manner i thought at the time that i must be dreaming when i saw them for though the moonlight was behind them they threw no shadow on the floor they came close to me and looked at me for some time and then whispered together two were dark and had high aquiline noses like the count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon the other was fair as fair as can be with great wavy masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires i seemed somehow to know her face and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear but i could not recollect at the moment how or where all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips there was something about them that made me uneasy some longing and at the same time some deadly fear i felt in my heart a wicked burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips it is not good to note this down lest some day it should meet minas eyes and cause her pain but it is the truth they whispered together and then they all three laughedsuch a silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips it was like the intolerable tingling sweetness of waterglasses when played on by a cunning hand the fair girl shook her head coquettishly and the other two urged her on one said ,Dracula
he is young and strong there are kisses for us all i lay quiet looking out under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation the fair girl advanced and bent over me till i could feel the movement of her breath upon me sweet it was in one sense honeysweet and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice but with a bitter underlying the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smells in blood ,Dracula
i was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes the girl went on her knees and bent over me simply gloating there was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed about to fasten on my throat then she paused and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips and could feel the hot breath on my neck then the skin of my throat began to tingle as ones flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearernearer i could feel the soft shivering touch of the lips on the supersensitive skin of my throat and the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing there i closed my eyes in a languorous ecstasy and waitedwaited with beating heart ,Dracula
but at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning i was conscious of the presence of the count and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury as my eyes opened involuntarily i saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giants power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury the white teeth champing with rage and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion but the count never did i imagine such wrath and fury even to the demons of the pit his eyes were positively blazing the red light in them was lurid as if the flames of hellfire blazed behind them his face was deathly pale and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of whitehot metal with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the woman from him and then motioned to the others as though he were beating them back it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the wolves in a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring round the room he said ,Dracula
how dare you touch him any of you how dare you cast eyes on him when i had forbidden it back i tell you all this man belongs to me beware how you meddle with him or youll have to deal with me the fair girl with a laugh of ribald coquetry turned to answer him ,Dracula
you yourself never loved you never love on this the other women joined and such a mirthless hard soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear it seemed like the pleasure of fiends then the count turned after looking at my face attentively and said in a soft whisper ,Dracula
yes i too can love you yourselves can tell it from the past is it not so well now i promise you that when i am done with him you shall kiss him at your will now go go i must awaken him for there is work to be done ,Dracula
are we to have nothing tonight said one of them with a low laugh as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which moved as though there were some living thing within it for answer he nodded his head one of the women jumped forward and opened it if my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wail as of a halfsmothered child the women closed round whilst i was aghast with horror but as i looked they disappeared and with them the dreadful bag there was no door near them and they could not have passed me without my noticing they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outside the dim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away ,Dracula
i awoke in my own bed if it be that i had not dreamt the count must have carried me here i tried to satisfy myself on the subject but could not arrive at any unquestionable result to be sure there were certain small evidences such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit my watch was still unwound and i am rigorously accustomed to wind it the last thing before going to bed and many such details but these things are no proof for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual and from some cause or another i had certainly been much upset i must watch for proof of one thing i am glad if it was that the count carried me here and undressed me he must have been hurried in his task for my pockets are intact i am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have brooked he would have taken or destroyed it as i look round this room although it has been to me so full of fear it is now a sort of sanctuary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women who werewho arewaiting to suck my blood ,Dracula
 mayi have been down to look at that room again in daylight for i must know the truth when i got to the doorway at the top of the stairs i found it closed it had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered i could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot but the door is fastened from the inside i fear it was no dream and must act on this surmise ,Dracula
 mayi am surely in the toils last night the count asked me in the suavest tones to write three letters one saying that my work here was nearly done and that i should start for home within a few days another that i was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter and the third that i had left the castle and arrived at bistritz i would fain have rebelled but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst i am so absolutely in his power and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger he knows that i know too much and that i must not live lest i be dangerous to him my only chance is to prolong my opportunities something may occur which will give me a chance to escape i saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him he explained to me that posts were few and uncertain and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends and he assured me with so much impressiveness that he would countermand the later letters which would be held over at bistritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion i therefore pretended to fall in with his views and asked him what dates i should put on the letters he calculated a minute and then said ,Dracula
 maythere is a chance of escape or at any rate of being able to send word home a band of szgany have come to the castle and are encamped in the courtyard these szgany are gipsies i have notes of them in my book they are peculiar to this part of the world though allied to the ordinary gipsies all the world over there are thousands of them in hungary and transylvania who are almost outside all law they attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar and call themselves by his name they are fearless and without religion save superstition and they talk only their own varieties of the romany tongue ,Dracula
i shall write some letters home and shall try to get them to have them posted i have already spoken them through my window to begin acquaintanceship they took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs which however i could not understand any more than i could their spoken language ,Dracula
i have written the letters minas is in shorthand and i simply ask mr hawkins to communicate with her to her i have explained my situation but without the horrors which i may only surmise it would shock and frighten her to death were i to expose my heart to her should the letters not carry then the count shall not yet know my secret or the extent of my knowledge ,Dracula
i have given the letters i threw them through the bars of my window with a gold piece and made what signs i could to have them posted the man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed and then put them in his cap i could do no more i stole back to the study and began to read as the count did not come in i have written here ,Dracula
the szgany has given me these of which though i know not whence they come i shall of course take care seehe must have looked at itone is from you and to my friend peter hawkins the otherhere he caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope and the dark look came into his face and his eyes blazed wickedlythe other is a vile thing an outrage upon friendship and hospitality it is not signed well so it cannot matter to us and he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed then he went on ,Dracula
the letter to hawkinsthat i shall of course send on since it is yours your letters are sacred to me your pardon my friend that unknowingly i did break the seal will you not cover it again he held out the letter to me and with a courteous bow handed me a clean envelope i could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence when he went out of the room i could hear the key turn softly a minute later i went over and tried it and the door was locked ,Dracula
when an hour or two after the count came quietly into the room his coming awakened me for i had gone to sleep on the sofa he was very courteous and very cheery in his manner and seeing that i had been sleeping he said ,Dracula
so my friend you are tired get to bed there is the surest rest i may not have the pleasure to talk tonight since there are many labours to me but you will sleep i pray i passed to my room and went to bed and strange to say slept without dreaming despair has its own calms ,Dracula
 maythis morning when i woke i thought i would provide myself with some paper and envelopes from my bag and keep them in my pocket so that i might write in case i should get an opportunity but again a surprise again a shock ,Dracula
every scrap of paper was gone and with it all my notes my memoranda relating to railways and travel my letter of credit in fact all that might be useful to me were i once outside the castle i sat and pondered awhile and then some thought occurred to me and i made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where i had placed my clothes ,Dracula
 junethis morning as i was sitting on the edge of my bed cudgelling my brains i heard without a cracking of whips and pounding and scraping of horses feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard with joy i hurried to the window and saw drive into the yard two great leiterwagons each drawn by eight sturdy horses and at the head of each pair a slovak with his wide hat great nailstudded belt dirty sheepskin and high boots they had also their long staves in hand i ran to the door intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall as i thought that way might be opened for them again a shock my door was fastened on the outside ,Dracula
then i ran to the window and cried to them they looked up at me stupidly and pointed but just then the hetman of the szgany came out and seeing them pointing to my window said something at which they laughed henceforth no effort of mine no piteous cry or agonised entreaty would make them even look at me they resolutely turned away the leiterwagons contained great square boxes with handles of thick rope these were evidently empty by the ease with which the slovaks handled them and by their resonance as they were roughly moved when they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard the slovaks were given some money by the szgany and spitting on it for luck lazily went each to his horses head shortly afterwards i heard the cracking of their whips die away in the distance ,Dracula
 june before morninglast night the count left me early and locked himself into his own room as soon as i dared i ran up the winding stair and looked out of the window which opened south i thought i would watch for the count for there is something going on the szgany are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind i know it for now and then i hear a faraway muffled sound as of mattock and spade and whatever it is it must be the end of some ruthless villainy ,Dracula
i had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour when i saw something coming out of the counts window i drew back and watched carefully and saw the whole man emerge it was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilst travelling here and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which i had seen the women take away there could be no doubt as to his quest and in my garb too this then is his new scheme of evil that he will allow others to see me as they think so that he may both leave evidence that i have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me ,Dracula
i thought i would watch for the counts return and for a long time sat doggedly at the window then i began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight they were like the tiniest grains of dust and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way i watched them with a sense of soothing and a sort of calm stole over me i leaned back in the embrasure in a more comfortable position so that i could enjoy more fully the arial gambolling ,Dracula
something made me start up a low piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley which was hidden from my sight louder it seemed to ring in my ears and the floating motes of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight i felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts nay my very soul was struggling and my halfremembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call i was becoming hypnotised quicker and quicker danced the dust the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond more and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes and then i started broad awake and in full possession of my senses and ran screaming from the place the phantom shapes which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams were those of the three ghostly women to whom i was doomed i fled and felt somewhat safer in my own room where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly ,Dracula
when a couple of hours had passed i heard something stirring in the counts room something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed and then there was silence deep awful silence which chilled me with a beating heart i tried the door but i was locked in my prison and could do nothing i sat down and simply cried ,Dracula
as i sat i heard a sound in the courtyard withoutthe agonised cry of a woman i rushed to the window and throwing it up peered out between the bars there indeed was a woman with dishevelled hair holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running she was leaning against a corner of the gateway when she saw my face at the window she threw herself forward and shouted in a voice laden with menace ,Dracula
she threw herself on her knees and raising up her hands cried the same words in tones which wrung my heart then she tore her hair and beat her breast and abandoned herself to all the violences of extravagant emotion finally she threw herself forward and though i could not see her i could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door ,Dracula
somewhere high overhead probably on the tower i heard the voice of the count calling in his harsh metallic whisper his call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the howling of wolves before many minutes had passed a pack of them poured like a pentup dam when liberated through the wide entrance into the courtyard ,Dracula
 june morningno man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and how dear to his heart and eye the morning can be when the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted there my fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth i must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me last night one of my postdated letters went to post the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth ,Dracula
it has always been at nighttime that i have been molested or threatened or in some way in danger or in fear i have not yet seen the count in the daylight can it be that he sleeps when others wake that he may be awake whilst they sleep if i could only get into his room but there is no possible way the door is always locked no way for me ,Dracula
yes there is a way if one dares to take it where his body has gone why may not another body go i have seen him myself crawl from his window why should not i imitate him and go in by his window the chances are desperate but my need is more desperate still i shall risk it at the worst it can only be death and a mans death is not a calfs and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me god help me in my task goodbye mina if i fail goodbye my faithful friend and second father goodbye all and last of all mina ,Dracula
same day lateri have made the effort and god helping me have come safely back to this room i must put down every detail in order i went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side and at once got outside on the narrow ledge of stone which runs around the building on this side the stones are big and roughly cut and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them i took off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way i looked down once so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it i knew pretty well the direction and distance of the counts window and made for it as well as i could having regard to the opportunities available i did not feel dizzyi suppose i was too excitedand the time seemed ridiculously short till i found myself standing on the windowsill and trying to raise up the sash i was filled with agitation however when i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window then i looked around for the count but with surprise and gladness made a discovery the room was empty it was barely furnished with odd things which seemed to have never been used the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust i looked for the key but it was not in the lock and i could not find it anywhere the only thing i found was a great heap of gold in one cornergold of all kinds roman and british and austrian and hungarian and greek and turkish money covered with a film of dust as though it had lain long in the ground none of it that i noticed was less than three hundred years old there were also chains and ornaments some jewelled but all of them old and stained ,Dracula
at one corner of the room was a heavy door i tried it for since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which was the main object of my search i must make further examination or all my efforts would be in vain it was open and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway which went steeply down i descended minding carefully where i went for the stairs were dark being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry at the bottom there was a dark tunnellike passage through which came a deathly sickly odour the odour of old earth newly turned as i went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier at last i pulled open a heavy door which stood ajar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidently been used as a graveyard the roof was broken and in two places were steps leading to vaults but the ground had recently been dug over and the earth placed in great wooden boxes manifestly those which had been brought by the slovaks there was nobody about and i made search for any further outlet but there was none then i went over every inch of the ground so as not to lose a chance i went down even into the vaults where the dim light struggled although to do so was a dread to my very soul into two of these i went but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust in the third however i made a discovery ,Dracula
there in one of the great boxes of which there were fifty in all on a pile of newly dug earth lay the count he was either dead or asleep i could not say whichfor the eyes were open and stony but without the glassiness of deathand the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor the lips were as red as ever but there was no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart i bent over him and tried to find any sign of life but in vain he could not have lain there long for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours by the side of the box was its cover pierced with holes here and there i thought he might have the keys on him but when i went to search i saw the dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hate though unconscious of me or my presence that i fled from the place and leaving the counts room by the window crawled again up the castle wall regaining my room i threw myself panting upon the bed and tried to think ,Dracula
 junetoday is the date of my last letter and the count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine for again i saw him leave the castle by the same window and in my clothes as he went down the wall lizard fashion i wished i had a gun or some lethal weapon that i might destroy him but i fear that no weapon wrought alone by mans hand would have any effect on him i dared not wait to see him return for i feared to see those weird sisters i came back to the library and read there till i fell asleep ,Dracula
tomorrow my friend we must part you return to your beautiful england i to some work which may have such an end that we may never meet your letter home has been despatched tomorrow i shall not be here but all shall be ready for your journey in the morning come the szgany who have some labours of their own here and also come some slovaks when they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shall bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to bistritz but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castle dracula i suspected him and determined to test his sincerity sincerity it seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so asked him pointblank ,Dracula
you english have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit is that which rules our boyars welcome the coming speed the parting guest come with me my dear young friend not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sad am i at your going and that you so suddenly desire it come with a stately gravity he with the lamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall suddenly he stopped ,Dracula
close at hand came the howling of many wolves it was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the bton of the conductor after a pause of a moment he proceeded in his stately way to the door drew back the ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chains and began to draw it open ,Dracula
as the door began to open the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier their red jaws with champing teeth and their bluntclawed feet as they leaped came in through the opening door i knew then that to struggle at the moment against the count was useless with such allies as these at his command i could do nothing but still the door continued slowly to open and only the counts body stood in the gap suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my doom i was to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation there was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count and as a last chance i cried out ,Dracula
shut the door i shall wait till morning and covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment with one sweep of his powerful arm the count threw the door shut and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places ,Dracula
in silence we returned to the library and after a minute or two i went to my own room the last i saw of count dracula was his kissing his hand to me with a red light of triumph in his eyes and with a smile that judas in hell might be proud of ,Dracula
back back to your own place your time is not yet come wait have patience tonight is mine tomorrow night is yours there was a low sweet ripple of laughter and in a rage i threw open the door and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips as i appeared they all joined in a horrible laugh and ran away ,Dracula
 june morningthese may be the last words i ever write in this diary i slept till just before the dawn and when i woke threw myself on my knees for i determined that if death came he should find me ready ,Dracula
at last i felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning had come then came the welcome cockcrow and i felt that i was safe with a glad heart i opened my door and ran down to the hall i had seen that the door was unlocked and now escape was before me with hands that trembled with eagerness i unhooked the chains and drew back the massive bolts ,Dracula
but the door would not move despair seized me i pulled and pulled at the door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in its casement i could see the bolt shot it had been locked after i left the count ,Dracula
then a wild desire took me to obtain that key at any risk and i determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the counts room he might kill me but death now seemed the happier choice of evils without a pause i rushed up to the east window and scrambled down the wall as before into the counts room it was empty but that was as i expected i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remained i went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel i knew now well enough where to find the monster i sought ,Dracula
the great box was in the same place close against the wall but the lid was laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home i knew i must reach the body for the key so i raised the lid and laid it back against the wall and then i saw something which filled my very soul with horror there lay the count but looking as if his youth had been half renewed for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark irongrey the cheeks were fuller and the white skin seemed rubyred underneath the mouth was redder than ever for on the lips were gouts of fresh blood which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran over the chin and neck even the deep burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the lids and pouches underneath were bloated it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply gorged with blood he lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his repletion i shuddered as i bent over to touch him and every sense in me revolted at the contact but i had to search or i was lost the coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar way to those horrid three i felt all over the body but no sign could i find of the key then i stopped and looked at the count there was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad this was the being i was helping to transfer to london where perhaps for centuries to come he might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood and create a new and everwidening circle of semidemons to batten on the helpless the very thought drove me mad a terrible desire came upon me to rid the world of such a monster there was no lethal weapon at hand but i seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases and lifting it high struck with the edge downward at the hateful face but as i did so the head turned and the eyes fell full upon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror the sight seemed to paralyse me and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face merely making a deep gash above the forehead the shovel fell from my hand across the box and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again and hid the horrid thing from my sight the last glimpse i had was of the bloated face bloodstained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nethermost hell ,Dracula
i thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seemed on fire and i waited with a despairing feeling growing over me as i waited i heard in the distance a gipsy song sung by merry voices coming closer and through their song the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips the szgany and the slovaks of whom the count had spoken were coming with a last look around and at the box which contained the vile body i ran from the place and gained the counts room determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened with strained ears i listened and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door there must have been some other means of entry or some one had a key for one of the locked doors then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which sent up a clanging echo i turned to run down again towards the vault where i might find the new entrance but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind and the door to the winding stair blew to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying when i ran to push it open i found that it was hopelessly fast i was again a prisoner and the net of doom was closing round me more closely ,Dracula
as i write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily doubtless the boxes with their freight of earth there is a sound of hammering it is the box being nailed down now i can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall with many other idle feet coming behind them ,Dracula
forgive my long delay in writing but i have been simply overwhelmed with work the life of an assistant schoolmistress is sometimes trying i am longing to be with you and by the sea where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air i have been working very hard lately because i want to keep up with jonathans studies and i have been practising shorthand very assiduously when we are married i shall be able to be useful to jonathan and if i can stenograph well enough i can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter at which also i am practising very hard he and i sometimes write letters in shorthand and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad when i am with you i shall keep a diary in the same way i dont mean one of those twopagestotheweekwithsundaysqueezedinacorner diaries but a sort of journal which i can write in whenever i feel inclined i do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people but it is not intended for them i may show it to jonathan some day if there is in it anything worth sharing but it is really an exercise book i shall try to do what i see lady journalists do interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations i am told that with a little practice one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day however we shall see i will tell you of my little plans when we meet i have just had a few hurried lines from jonathan from transylvania he is well and will be returning in about a week i am longing to hear all his news it must be so nice to see strange countries i wonder if wei mean jonathan and ishall ever see them together there is the ten oclock bell ringing goodbye ,Dracula
i must say you tax me very unfairly with being a bad correspondent i wrote to you twice since we parted and your last letter was only your second besides i have nothing to tell you there is really nothing to interest you town is very pleasant just now and we go a good deal to picturegalleries and for walks and rides in the park as to the tall curlyhaired man i suppose it was the one who was with me at the last pop some one has evidently been telling tales that was mr holmwood he often comes to see us and he and mamma get on very well together they have so many things to talk about in common we met some time ago a man that would just do for you if you were not already engaged to jonathan he is an excellent parti being handsome well off and of good birth he is a doctor and really clever just fancy he is only nineandtwenty and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care mr holmwood introduced him to me and he called here to see us and often comes now i think he is one of the most resolute men i ever saw and yet the most calm he seems absolutely imperturbable i can fancy what a wonderful power he must have over his patients he has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face as if trying to read ones thoughts he tries this on very much with me but i flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack i know that from my glass do you ever try to read your own face i do and i can tell you it is not a bad study and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it he says that i afford him a curious psychological study and i humbly think i do i do not as you know take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions dress is a bore that is slang again but never mind arthur says that every day there it is all out mina we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children we have slept together and eaten together and laughed and cried together and now though i have spoken i would like to speak more oh mina couldnt you guess i love him i am blushing as i write for although i think he loves me he has not told me so in words but oh mina i love him i love him i love him there that does me good i wish i were with you dear sitting by the fire undressing as we used to sit and i would try to tell you what i feel i do not know how i am writing this even to you i am afraid to stop or i should tear up the letter and i dont want to stop for i do so want to tell you all let me hear from you at once and tell me all that you think about it mina i must stop goodnight bless me in your prayers and mina pray for my happiness ,Dracula
my dear it never rains but it pours how true the old proverbs are here am i who shall be twenty in september and yet i never had a proposal till today not a real proposal and today i have had three just fancy three proposals in one day isnt it awful i feel sorry really and truly sorry for two of the poor fellows oh mina i am so happy that i dont know what to do with myself and three proposals but for goodness sake dont tell any of the girls or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured and slighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least some girls are so vain you and i mina dear who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women can despise vanity well i must tell you about the three but you must keep it a secret dear from every one except of course jonathan you will tell him because i would if i were in your place certainly tell arthur a woman ought to tell her husband everythingdont you think so dearand i must be fair men like women certainly their wives to be quite as fair as they are and women i am afraid are not always quite as fair as they should be well my dear number one came just before lunch i told you of him dr john seward the lunaticasylum man with the strong jaw and the good forehead he was very cool outwardly but was nervous all the same he had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things and remembered them but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat which men dont generally do when they are cool and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream he spoke to me mina very straightforwardly he told me how dear i was to him though he had known me so little and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him he was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if i did not care for him but when he saw me cry he said that he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble then he broke off and asked if i could love him in time and when i shook my head his hands trembled and then with some hesitation he asked me if i cared already for any one else he put it very nicely saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me but only to know because if a womans heart was free a man might have hope and then mina i felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was some one i only told him that much and then he stood up and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped i would be happy and that if i ever wanted a friend i must count him one of my best oh mina dear i cant help crying and you must excuse this letter being all blotted being proposed to is all very nice and all that sort of thing but it isnt at all a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow whom you know loves you honestly going away and looking all brokenhearted and to know that no matter what he may say at the moment you are passing quite out of his life my dear i must stop here at present i feel so miserable though i am so happy ,Dracula
arthur has just gone and i feel in better spirits than when i left off so i can go on telling you about the day well my dear number two came after lunch he is such a nice fellow an american from texas and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has had such adventures i sympathise with poor desdemona when she had such a dangerous stream poured in her ear even by a black man i suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears and we marry him i know now what i would do if i were a man and wanted to make a girl love me no i dont for there was mr morris telling us his stories and arthur never told any and yet my dear i am somewhat previous mr quincey p morris found me alone it seems that a man always does find a girl alone no he doesnt for arthur tried twice to make a chance and i helping him all i could i am not ashamed to say it now i must tell you beforehand that mr morris doesnt always speak slangthat is to say he never does so to strangers or before them for he is really well educated and has exquisite mannersbut he found out that it amused me to hear him talk american slang and whenever i was present and there was no one to be shocked he said such funny things i am afraid my dear he has to invent it all for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say but this is a way slang has i do not know myself if i shall ever speak slang i do not know if arthur likes it as i have never heard him use any as yet well mr morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could but i could see all the same that he was very nervous he took my hand in his and said ever so sweetly ,Dracula
miss lucy i know i aint good enough to regulate the fixins of your little shoes but i guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit wont you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together driving in double harness ,Dracula
well he did look so goodhumoured and so jolly that it didnt seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poor dr seward so i said as lightly as i could that i did not know anything of hitching and that i wasnt broken to harness at all yet then he said that he had spoken in a light manner and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave so momentous an occasion for him i would forgive him he really did look serious when he was saying it and i couldnt help feeling a bit serious tooi know mina you will think me a horrid flirtthough i couldnt help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day and then my dear before i could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of lovemaking laying his very heart and soul at my feet he looked so earnest over it that i shall never again think that a man must be playful always and never earnest because he is merry at times i suppose he saw something in my face which checked him for he suddenly stopped and said with a sort of manly fervour that i could have loved him for if i had been free ,Dracula
lucy you are an honesthearted girl i know i should not be here speaking to you as i am now if i did not believe you clean grit right through to the very depths of your soul tell me like one good fellow to another is there any one else that you care for and if there is ill never trouble you a hairs breadth again but will be if you will let me a very faithful friend ,Dracula
my dear mina why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them here was i almost making fun of this greathearted true gentleman i burst into tearsi am afraid my dear you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than oneand i really felt very badly why cant they let a girl marry three men or as many as want her and save all this trouble but this is heresy and i must not say it i am glad to say that though i was crying i was able to look into mr morriss brave eyes and i told him out straight ,Dracula
yes there is some one i love though he has not told me yet that he even loves me i was right to speak to him so frankly for quite a light came into his face and he put out both his hands and took minei think i put them into hisand said in a hearty way ,Dracula
thats my brave girl its better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world dont cry my dear if its for me im a hard nut to crack and i take it standing up if that other fellow doesnt know his happiness well hed better look for it soon or hell have to deal with me little girl your honesty and pluck have made me a friend and thats rarer than a lover its more unselfish anyhow my dear im going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and kingdom come wont you give me one kiss itll be something to keep off the darkness now and then you can you know if you like for that other good fellowhe must be a good fellow my dear and a fine fellow or you could not love himhasnt spoken yet that quite won me mina for it was brave and sweet of him and noble too to a rivalwasnt itand he so sad so i leant over and kissed him he stood up with my two hands in his and as he looked down into my facei am afraid i was blushing very muchhe said ,Dracula
little girl i hold your hand and youve kissed me and if these things dont make us friends nothing ever will thank you for your sweet honesty to me and goodbye he wrung my hand and taking up his hat went straight out of the room without looking back without a tear or a quiver or a pause and i am crying like a baby oh why must a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground he trod on i know i would if i were freeonly i dont want to be free my dear this quite upset me and i feel i cannot write of happiness just at once after telling you of it and i dont wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy ,Dracula
psoh about number threei neednt tell you of number three need i besides it was all so confused it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were round me and he was kissing me i am very very happy and i dont know what i have done to deserve it i must only try in the future to show that i am not ungrateful to god for all his goodness to me in sending to me such a lover such a husband and such a friend ,Dracula
 mayebb tide in appetite today cannot eat cannot rest so diary instead since my rebuff of yesterday i have a sort of empty feeling nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing as i knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work i went down amongst the patients i picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest he is so quaint that i am determined to understand him as well as i can today i seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery ,Dracula
i questioned him more fully than i had ever done with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination in my manner of doing it there was i now see something of cruelty i seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madnessa thing which i avoid with the patients as i would the mouth of hell ,Dracula
mem under what circumstances would i not avoid the pit of hell omnia rom venalia sunt hell has its price verb sap if there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards accurately so i had better commence to do so therefore ,Dracula
r m renfield tat sanguine temperament great physical strength morbidly excitable periods of gloom ending in some fixed idea which i cannot make out i presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentallyaccomplished finish a possibly dangerous man probably dangerous if unselfish in selfish men caution is as secure an armour for their foes as for themselves what i think of on this point is when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal when duty a cause etc is the fixed point the latter force is paramount and only accident or a series of accidents can balance it ,Dracula
weve told yarns by the campfire in the prairies and dressed one anothers wounds after trying a landing at the marquesas and drunk healths on the shore of titicaca there are more yarns to be told and other wounds to be healed and another health to be drunk wont you let this be at my campfire tomorrow night i have no hesitation in asking you as i know a certain lady is engaged to a certain dinnerparty and that you are free there will only be one other our old pal at the korea jack seward hes coming too and we both want to mingle our weeps over the winecup and to drink a health with all our hearts to the happiest man in all the wide world who has won the noblest heart that god has made and the best worth winning we promise you a hearty welcome and a loving greeting and a health as true as your own right hand we shall both swear to leave you at home if you drink too deep to a certain pair of eyes come ,Dracula
 july whitbylucy met me at the station looking sweeter and lovelier than ever and we drove up to the house at the crescent in which they have rooms this is a lovely place the little river the esk runs through a deep valley which broadens out as it comes near the harbour a great viaduct runs across with high piers through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is the valley is beautifully green and it is so steep that when you are on the high land on either side you look right across it unless you are near enough to see down the houses of the old townthe side away from usare all redroofed and seem piled up one over the other anyhow like the pictures we see of nuremberg right over the town is the ruin of whitby abbey which was sacked by the danes and which is the scene of part of marmion where the girl was built up in the wall it is a most noble ruin of immense size and full of beautiful and romantic bits there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows between it and the town there is another church the parish one round which is a big graveyard all full of tombstones this is to my mind the nicest spot in whitby for it lies right over the town and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called kettleness stretches out into the sea it descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away and some of the graves have been destroyed in one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below there are walks with seats beside them through the churchyard and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze i shall come and sit here very often myself and work indeed i am writing now with my book on my knee and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me they seem to do nothing all day but sit up here and talk ,Dracula
the harbour lies below me with on the far side one long granite wall stretching out into the sea with a curve outwards at the end of it in the middle of which is a lighthouse a heavy seawall runs along outside of it on the near side the seawall makes an elbow crooked inversely and its end too has a lighthouse between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour which then suddenly widens ,Dracula
it is nice at high water but when the tide is out it shoals away to nothing and there is merely the stream of the esk running between banks of sand with rocks here and there outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile a great reef the sharp edge of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse at the end of it is a buoy with a bell which swings in bad weather and sends in a mournful sound on the wind they have a legend here that when a ship is lost bells are heard out at sea i must ask the old man about this he is coming this way ,Dracula
he is a funny old man he must be awfully old for his face is all gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree he tells me that he is nearly a hundred and that he was a sailor in the greenland fishing fleet when waterloo was fought he is i am afraid a very sceptical person for when i asked him about the bells at sea and the white lady at the abbey he said very brusquely ,Dracula
i wouldnt fash masel about them miss them things be all wore out mind i dont say that they never was but i do say that they wasnt in my time they be all very well for comers and trippers an the like but not for a nice young lady like you them feetfolks from york and leeds that be always eatin cured herrins an drinkin tea an lookin out to buy cheap jet would creed aught i wonder masel whod be bothered tellin lies to themeven the newspapers which is full of fooltalk i thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from so i asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whalefishing in the old days he was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six whereupon he laboured to get up and said ,Dracula
i must gang ageeanwards home now miss my granddaughter doesnt like to be kept waitin when the tea is ready for it takes me time to crammle aboon the grees for there be a many of em an miss i lack bellytimber sairly by the clock ,Dracula
he hobbled away and i could see him hurrying as well as he could down the steps the steps are a great feature on the place they lead from the town up to the church there are hundreds of themi do not know how manyand they wind up in a delicate curve the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down them i think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey i shall go home too lucy went out visiting with her mother and as they were only duty calls i did not go they will be home by this ,Dracula
 augusti came up here an hour ago with lucy and we had a most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him he is evidently the sir oracle of them and i should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person he will not admit anything and downfaces everybody if he cant outargue them he bullies them and then takes their silence for agreement with his views lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn frock she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here i noticed that the old men did not lose any time in coming up and sitting near her when we sat down she is so sweet with old people i think they all fell in love with her on the spot even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her but gave me double share instead i got him on the subject of the legends and he went off at once into a sort of sermon i must try to remember it and put it down ,Dracula

but i said surely you are not quite correct for you start on the assumption that all the poor people or their spirits will have to take their tombstones with them on the day of judgment do you think that will be really necessary ,Dracula
to please their relatives you suppose this he said with intense scorn how will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them and that everybody in the place knows that they be lies he pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab on which the seat was rested close to the edge of the cliff read the lies on that thruffstean he said the letters were upside down to me from where i sat but lucy was more opposite to them so she leant over and read ,Dracula
sacred to the memory of george canon who died in the hope of a glorious resurrection on july   falling from the rocks at kettleness this tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow really mr swales i dont see anything very funny in that she spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely ,Dracula
ye dont see aught funny ha ha but thats because ye dont gawm the sorrowin mother was a hellcat that hated him because he was acrewkda regular lamiter he wasan he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightnt get an insurance she put on his life he blew nigh the top of his head off with an old musket that they had for scarin the crows with twarnt for crows then for it brought the clegs and the dowps to him thats the way he fell off the rocks and as to hopes of a glorious resurrection ive often heard him say masel that he hoped hed go to hell for his mother was so pious that shed be sure to go to heaven an he didnt want to addle where she was now isnt that stean at any ratehe hammered it with his stick as he spokea pack of lies and wont it make gabriel keckle when geordie comes pantin up the grees with the tombstean balanced on his hump and asks it to be took as evidence ,Dracula

lucy and i sat awhile and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat and she told me all over again about arthur and their coming marriage that made me just a little heartsick for i havent heard from jonathan for a whole month ,Dracula
the same day i came up here alone for i am very sad there was no letter for me i hope there cannot be anything the matter with jonathan the clock has just struck nine i see the lights scattered all over the town sometimes in rows where the streets are and sometimes singly they run right up the esk and die away in the curve of the valley to my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next the abbey the sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me and there is a clatter of a donkeys hoofs up the paved road below the band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time and further along the quay there is a salvation army meeting in a back street neither of the bands hears the other but up here i hear and see them both i wonder where jonathan is and if he is thinking of me i wish he were here ,Dracula
 junethe case of renfield grows more interesting the more i get to understand the man he has certain qualities very largely developed selfishness secrecy and purpose i wish i could get at what is the object of the latter he seems to have some settled scheme of his own but what it is i do not yet know his redeeming quality is a love of animals though indeed he has such curious turns in it that i sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel his pets are of odd sorts just now his hobby is catching flies he has at present such a quantity that i have had myself to expostulate to my astonishment he did not break out into a fury as i expected but took the matter in simple seriousness he thought for a moment and then said may i have three days i shall clear them away of course i said that would do i must watch him ,Dracula
 junehe has turned his mind now to spiders and has got several very big fellows in a box he keeps feeding them with his flies and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room ,Dracula
 julyhis spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies and today i told him that he must get rid of them he looked very sad at this so i said that he must clear out some of them at all events he cheerfully acquiesced in this and i gave him the same time as before for reduction he disgusted me much while with him for when a horrid blowfly bloated with some carrion food buzzed into the room he caught it held it exultantly for a few moments between his finger and thumb and before i knew what he was going to do put it in his mouth and ate it i scolded him for it but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome that it was life strong life and gave life to him this gave me an idea or the rudiment of one i must watch how he gets rid of his spiders he has evidently some deep problem in his mind for he keeps a little notebook in which he is always jotting down something whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures generally single numbers added up in batches and then the totals added in batches again as though he were focussing some account as the auditors put it ,Dracula
 julythere is a method in his madness and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing it will be a whole idea soon and then oh unconscious cerebration you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother i kept away from my friend for a few days so that i might notice if there were any change things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one he has managed to get a sparrow and has already partially tamed it his means of taming is simple for already the spiders have diminished those that do remain however are well fed for he still brings in the flies by tempting them with his food ,Dracula
 julywe are progressing my friend has now a whole colony of sparrows and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated when i came in he ran to me and said he wanted to ask me a great favoura very very great favour and as he spoke he fawned on me like a dog i asked him what it was and he said with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing ,Dracula
a kitten a nice little sleek playful kitten that i can play with and teach and feedand feedand feed i was not unprepared for this request for i had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity but i did not care that his pretty family of tame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and the spiders so i said i would see about it and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten his eagerness betrayed him as he answered ,Dracula
oh yes i would like a cat i only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat no one would refuse me a kitten would they i shook my head and said that at present i feared it would not be possible but that i would see about it his face fell and i could see a warning of danger in it for there was a sudden fierce sidelong look which meant killing the man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac i shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out then i shall know more ,Dracula
 p mi have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding when i came in he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat that his salvation depended upon it i was firm however and told him that he could not have it whereupon he went without a word and sat down gnawing his fingers in the corner where i had found him i shall see him in the morning early ,Dracula
 julyvisited renfield very early before the attendant went his rounds found him up and humming a tune he was spreading out his sugar which he had saved in the window and was manifestly beginning his flycatching again and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace i looked around for his birds and not seeing them asked him where they were he replied without turning round that they had all flown away there were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of blood i said nothing but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day ,Dracula
 a mthe attendant has just been to me to say that renfield has been very sick and has disgorged a whole lot of feathers my belief is doctor he said that he has eaten his birds and that he just took and ate them raw ,Dracula
 p mi gave renfield a strong opiate tonight enough to make even him sleep and took away his pocketbook to look at it the thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete and the theory proved my homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind i shall have to invent a new classification for him and call him a zophagous lifeeating maniac what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can and he has laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way he gave many flies to one spider and many spiders to one bird and then wanted a cat to eat the many birds what would have been his later steps it would almost be worth while to complete the experiment it might be done if there were only a sufficient cause men sneered at vivisection and yet look at its results today why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspectthe knowledge of the brain had i even the secret of one such minddid i hold the key to the fancy of even one lunatici might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which burdonsandersons physiology or ferriers brainknowledge would be as nothing if only there were a sufficient cause i must not think too much of this or i may be tempted a good cause might turn the scale with me for may not i too be of an exceptional brain congenitally ,Dracula
how well the man reasoned lunatics always do within their own scope i wonder at how many lives he values a man or if at only one he has closed the account most accurately and today begun a new record how many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives ,Dracula
to me it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope and that truly i began a new record so it will be until the great recorder sums me up and closes my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss oh lucy lucy i cannot be angry with you nor can i be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours but i must only wait on hopeless and work work work ,Dracula
 julyi am anxious and it soothes me to express myself here it is like whispering to ones self and listening at the same time and there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing i am unhappy about lucy and about jonathan i had not heard from jonathan for some time and was very concerned but yesterday dear mr hawkins who is always so kind sent me a letter from him i had written asking him if he had heard and he said the enclosed had just been received it is only a line dated from castle dracula and says that he is just starting for home that is not like jonathan i do not understand it and it makes me uneasy then too lucy although she is so well has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep her mother has spoken to me about it and we have decided that i am to lock the door of our room every night mrs westenra has got an idea that sleepwalkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place poor dear she is naturally anxious about lucy and she tells me that her husband lucys father had the same habit that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out if he were not stopped lucy is to be married in the autumn and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged i sympathise with her for i do the same only jonathan and i will start in life in a very simple way and shall have to try to make both ends meet mr holmwoodhe is the hon arthur holmwood only son of lord godalmingis coming up here very shortlyas soon as he can leave town for his father is not very well and i think dear lucy is counting the moments till he comes she wants to take him up to the seat on the churchyard cliff and show him the beauty of whitby i daresay it is the waiting which disturbs her she will be all right when he arrives ,Dracula
 julyno news from jonathan i am getting quite uneasy about him though why i should i do not know but i do wish that he would write if it were only a single line lucy walks more than ever and each night i am awakened by her moving about the room fortunately the weather is so hot that she cannot get cold but still the anxiety and the perpetually being wakened is beginning to tell on me and i am getting nervous and wakeful myself thank god lucys health keeps up mr holmwood has been suddenly called to ring to see his father who has been taken seriously ill lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him but it does not touch her looks she is a trifle stouter and her cheeks are a lovely rosepink she has lost that anmic look which she had i pray it will all last ,Dracula
 augustanother week gone and no news from jonathan not even to mr hawkins from whom i have heard oh i do hope he is not ill he surely would have written i look at that last letter of his but somehow it does not satisfy me it does not read like him and yet it is his writing there is no mistake of that lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week but there is an odd concentration about her which i do not understand even in her sleep she seems to be watching me she tries the door and finding it locked goes about the room searching for the key ,Dracula
 augustanother three days and no news this suspense is getting dreadful if i only knew where to write to or where to go to i should feel easier but no one has heard a word of jonathan since that last letter i must only pray to god for patience lucy is more excitable than ever but is otherwise well last night was very threatening and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm i must try to watch it and learn the weather signs today is a grey day and the sun as i write is hidden in thick clouds high over kettleness everything is greyexcept the green grass which seems like emerald amongst it grey earthy rock grey clouds tinged with the sunburst at the far edge hang over the grey sea into which the sandpoints stretch like grey fingers the sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a roar muffled in the seamists drifting inland the horizon is lost in a grey mist all is vastness the clouds are piled up like giant rocks and there is a brool over the sea that sounds like some presage of doom dark figures are on the beach here and there sometimes half shrouded in the mist and seem men like trees walking the fishingboats are racing for home and rise and dip in the ground swell as they sweep into the harbour bending to the scuppers here comes old mr swales he is making straight for me and i can see by the way he lifts his hat that he wants to talk ,Dracula

i cant make her out he said shes a russian by the look of her but shes knocking about in the queerest way she doesnt know her mind a bit she seems to see the storm coming but cant decide whether to run up north in the open or to put in here look there again she is steered mighty strangely for she doesnt mind the hand on the wheel changes about with every puff of wind well hear more of her before this time tomorrow ,Dracula
one of the greatest and suddenest storms on record has just been experienced here with results both strange and unique the weather had been somewhat sultry but not to any degree uncommon in the month of august saturday evening was as fine as was ever known and the great body of holidaymakers laid out yesterday for visits to mulgrave woods robin hoods bay rig mill runswick staithes and the various trips in the neighbourhood of whitby the steamers emma and scarborough made trips up and down the coast and there was an unusual amount of tripping both to and from whitby the day was unusually fine till the afternoon when some of the gossips who frequent the east cliff churchyard and from that commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east called attention to a sudden show of marestails high in the sky to the northwest the wind was then blowing from the southwest in the mild degree which in barometrical language is ranked no  light breeze the coastguard on duty at once made report and one old fisherman who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the east cliff foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm the approach of sunset was so very beautiful so grand in its masses of splendidlycoloured clouds that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old churchyard to enjoy the beauty before the sun dipped below the black mass of kettleness standing boldly athwart the western sky its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunsetcolourflame purple pink green violet and all the tints of gold with here and there masses not large but of seemingly absolute blackness in all sorts of shapes as well outlined as colossal silhouettes the experience was not lost on the painters and doubtless some of the sketches of the prelude to the great storm will grace the r a and r i walls in may next more than one captain made up his mind then and there that his cobble or his mule as they term the different classes of boats would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed the wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight there was a dead calm a sultry heat and that prevailing intensity which on the approach of thunder affects persons of a sensitive nature there were but few lights in sight at sea for even the coasting steamers which usually hug the shore so closely kept well to seaward and but few fishingboats were in sight the only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set which was seemingly going westwards the foolhardiness or ignorance of her officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in face of her danger before the night shut down she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea ,Dracula
shortly before ten oclock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep inland or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard and the band on the pier with its lively french air was like a discord in the great harmony of natures silence a little after midnight came a strange sound from over the sea and high overhead the air began to carry a strange faint hollow booming ,Dracula
then without warning the tempest broke with a rapidity which at the time seemed incredible and even afterwards is impossible to realize the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed the waves rose in growing fury each overtopping its fellow till in a very few minutes the lately glassy sea was like a roaring and devouring monster whitecrested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs others broke over the piers and with their spume swept the lanthorns of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of whitby harbour the wind roared like thunder and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions it was found necessary to clear the entire piers from the mass of onlookers or else the fatalities of the night would have been increased manifold to add to the difficulties and dangers of the time masses of seafog came drifting inlandwhite wet clouds which swept by in ghostly fashion so dank and damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clammy hands of death and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of seamist swept by at times the mist cleared and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning which now came thick and fast followed by such sudden peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm ,Dracula
some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interestthe sea running mountains high threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space here and there a fishingboat with a rag of sail running madly for shelter before the blast now and again the white wings of a stormtossed seabird on the summit of the east cliff the new searchlight was ready for experiment but had not yet been tried the officers in charge of it got it into working order and in the pauses of the inrushing mist swept with it the surface of the sea once or twice its service was most effective as when a fishingboat with gunwale under water rushed into the harbour able by the guidance of the sheltering light to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers as each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on shore a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush ,Dracula
before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening the wind had by this time backed to the east and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now was between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered and with the wind blowing from its present quarter it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour it was now nearly the hour of high tide but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible and the schooner with all sails set was rushing with such speed that in the words of one old salt she must fetch up somewhere if it was only in hell then came another rush of seafog greater than any hithertoa mass of dank mist which seemed to close on all things like a grey pall and left available to men only the organ of hearing for the roar of the tempest and the crash of the thunder and the booming of the mighty billows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before the rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the east pier where the shock was expected and men waited breathless the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast and the remnant of the seafog melted in the blast and then mirabile dictu between the piers leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed swept the strange schooner before the blast with all sail set and gained the safety of the harbour the searchlight followed her and a shudder ran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm was a corpse with drooping head which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship no other form could be seen on deck at all a great awe came on all as they realised that the ship as if by a miracle had found the harbour unsteered save by the hand of a dead man however all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words the schooner paused not but rushing across the harbour pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the east cliff known locally as tate hill pier ,Dracula
there was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap every spar rope and stay was strained and some of the tophammer came crashing down but strangest of all the very instant the shore was touched an immense dog sprang up on deck from below as if shot up by the concussion and running forward jumped from the bow on the sand making straight for the steep cliff where the churchyard hangs over the laneway to the east pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstonesthruffsteans or throughstones as they call them in the whitby vernacularactually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away it disappeared in the darkness which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight ,Dracula
it so happened that there was no one at the moment on tate hill pier as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour who at once ran down to the little pier was the first to climb on board the men working the searchlight after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there the coastguard ran aft and when he came beside the wheel bent over to examine it and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion this seemed to pique general curiosity and quite a number of people began to run it is a good way round from the west cliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier but your correspondent is a fairly good runner and came well ahead of the crowd when i arrived however i found already assembled on the pier a crowd whom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board by the courtesy of the chief boatman i was as your correspondent permitted to climb on deck and was one of a small group who saw the dead seaman whilst actually lashed to the wheel ,Dracula
it was no wonder that the coastguard was surprised or even awed for not often can such a sight have been seen the man was simply fastened by his hands tied one over the other to a spoke of the wheel between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel and all kept fast by the binding cords the poor fellow may have been seated at one time but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and dragged him to and fro so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone accurate note was made of the state of things and a doctorsurgeon j m caffyn of  east elliot placewho came immediately after me declared after making examination that the man must have been dead for quite two days in his pocket was a bottle carefully corked empty save for a little roll of paper which proved to be the addendum to the log the coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands fastening the knots with his teeth the fact that a coastguard was the first on board may save some complications later on in the admiralty court for coastguards cannot claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict already however the legal tongues are wagging and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed his property being held in contravention of the statutes of mortmain since the tiller as emblemship if not proof of delegated possession is held in a dead hand it is needless to say that the dead steersman has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till deatha steadfastness as noble as that of the young casabiancaand placed in the mortuary to await inquest ,Dracula
already the sudden storm is passing and its fierceness is abating crowds are scattering homeward and the sky is beginning to redden over the yorkshire wolds i shall send in time for your next issue further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm ,Dracula
 augustthe sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself it turns out that the schooner is a russian from varna and is called the demeter she is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand with only a small amount of cargoa number of great wooden boxes filled with mould this cargo was consigned to a whitby solicitor mr s f billington of  the crescent who this morning went aboard and formally took possession of the goods consigned to him the russian consul too acting for the charterparty took formal possession of the ship and paid all harbour dues etc nothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence the officials of the board of trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations as the matter is to be a nine days wonder they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of after complaint a good deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ship struck and more than a few of the members of the s p c a which is very strong in whitby have tried to befriend the animal to the general disappointment however it was not to be found it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town it may be that it was frightened and made its way on to the moors where it is still hiding in terror there are some who look with dread on such a possibility lest later on it should in itself become a danger for it is evidently a fierce brute early this morning a large dog a halfbred mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to tate hill pier was found dead in the roadway opposite to its masters yard it had been fighting and manifestly had had a savage opponent for its throat was torn away and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw ,Dracula
laterby the kindness of the board of trade inspector i have been permitted to look over the logbook of the demeter which was in order up to within three days but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men the greatest interest however is with regard to the paper found in the bottle which was today produced at the inquest and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across as there is no motive for concealment i am permitted to use them and accordingly send you a rescript simply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercargo it almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had got well into blue water and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage of course my statement must be taken cum grano since i am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the russian consul who kindly translated for me time being short ,Dracula
on  july was somewhat anxious about crew men all steady fellows who sailed with me before mate could not make out what was wrong they only told him there was something and crossed themselves mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him expected fierce quarrel but all was quiet ,Dracula
on  july mate reported in the morning that one of crew petrofsky was missing could not account for it took larboard watch eight bells last night was relieved by abramoff but did not go to bunk men more downcast than ever all said they expected something of the kind but would not say more than there was something aboard mate getting very impatient with them feared some trouble ahead ,Dracula
on  july yesterday one of the men olgaren came to my cabin and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange man aboard the ship he said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deckhouse as there was a rainstorm when he saw a tall thin man who was not like any of the crew come up the companionway and go along the deck forward and disappear he followed cautiously but when he got to bows found no one and the hatchways were all closed he was in a panic of superstitious fear and i am afraid the panic may spread to allay it i shall today search entire ship carefully from stem to stern ,Dracula
later in the day i got together the whole crew and told them as they evidently thought there was some one in the ship we would search from stem to stern first mate angry said it was folly and to yield to such foolish ideas would demoralise the men said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with a handspike i let him take the helm while the rest began thorough search all keeping abreast with lanterns we left no corner unsearched as there were only the big wooden boxes there were no odd corners where a man could hide men much relieved when search over and went back to work cheerfully first mate scowled but said nothing ,Dracula
 julyrough weather last three days and all hands busy with sailsno time to be frightened men seem to have forgotten their dread mate cheerful again and all on good terms praised men for work in bad weather passed gibralter and out through straits all well ,Dracula
 julythere seems some doom over this ship already a hand short and entering on the bay of biscay with wild weather ahead and yet last night another man lostdisappeared like the first he came off his watch and was not seen again men all in a panic of fear sent a round robin asking to have double watch as they fear to be alone mate angry fear there will be some trouble as either he or the men will do some violence ,Dracula
 julyfour days in hell knocking about in a sort of maelstrom and the wind a tempest no sleep for any one men all worn out hardly know how to set a watch since no one fit to go on second mate volunteered to steer and watch and let men snatch a few hours sleep wind abating seas still terrific but feel them less as ship is steadier ,Dracula
 julyanother tragedy had single watch tonight as crew too tired to double when morning watch came on deck could find no one except steersman raised outcry and all came on deck thorough search but no one found are now without second mate and crew in a panic mate and i agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause ,Dracula
 julylast night rejoiced we are nearing england weather fine all sails set retired worn out slept soundly awaked by mate telling me that both man of watch and steersman missing only self and mate and two hands left to work ship ,Dracula
 augusttwo days of fog and not a sail sighted had hoped when in the english channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere not having power to work sails have to run before wind dare not lower as could not raise them again we seem to be drifting to some terrible doom mate now more demoralised than either of men his stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself men are beyond fear working stolidly and patiently with minds made up to worst they are russian he roumanian ,Dracula
 august midnightwoke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a cry seemingly outside my port could see nothing in fog rushed on deck and ran against mate tells me heard cry and ran but no sign of man on watch one more gone lord help us mate says we must be past straits of dover as in a moment of fog lifting he saw north foreland just as he heard the man cry out if so we are now off in the north sea and only god can guide us in the fog which seems to move with us and god seems to have deserted us ,Dracula
 augustat midnight i went to relieve the man at the wheel and when i got to it found no one there the wind was steady and as we ran before it there was no yawing i dared not leave it so shouted for the mate after a few seconds he rushed up on deck in his flannels he looked wildeyed and haggard and i greatly fear his reason has given way he came close to me and whispered hoarsely with his mouth to my ear as though fearing the very air might hear it is here i know it now on the watch last night i saw it like a man tall and thin and ghastly pale it was in the bows and looking out i crept behind it and gave it my knife but the knife went through it empty as the air and as he spoke he took his knife and drove it savagely into space then he went on but it is here and ill find it it is in the hold perhaps in one of those boxes ill unscrew them one by one and see you work the helm and with a warning look and his finger on his lip he went below there was springing up a choppy wind and i could not leave the helm i saw him come out on deck again with a toolchest and a lantern and go down the forward hatchway he is mad stark raving mad and its no use my trying to stop him he cant hurt those big boxes they are invoiced as clay and to pull them about is as harmless a thing as he can do so here i stay and mind the helm and write these notes i can only trust in god and wait till the fog clears then if i cant steer to any harbour with the wind that is i shall cut down sails and lie by and signal for help ,Dracula
it is nearly all over now just as i was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmerfor i heard him knocking away at something in the hold and work is good for himthere came up the hatchway a sudden startled scream which made my blood run cold and up on the deck he came as if shot from a guna raging madman with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear save me save me he cried and then looked round on the blanket of fog his horror turned to despair and in a steady voice he said you had better come too captain before it is too late he is there i know the secret now the sea will save me from him and it is all that is left before i could say a word or move forward to seize him he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea i suppose i know the secret too now it was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one and now he has followed them himself god help me how am i to account for all these horrors when i get to port when i get to port will that ever be ,Dracula
 auguststill fog which the sunrise cannot pierce i know there is sunrise because i am a sailor why else i know not i dared not go below i dared not leave the helm so here all night i stayed and in the dimness of the night i saw ithim god forgive me but the mate was right to jump overboard it was better to die like a man to die like a sailor in blue water no man can object but i am captain and i must not leave my ship but i shall baffle this fiend or monster for i shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail and along with them i shall tie that which heitdare not touch and then come good wind or foul i shall save my soul and my honour as a captain i am growing weaker and the night is coming on if he can look me in the face again i may not have time to act if we are wrecked mayhap this bottle may be found and those who find it may understand if not  well then all men shall know that i have been true to my trust god and the blessed virgin and the saints help a poor ignorant soul trying to do his duty ,Dracula
of course the verdict was an open one there is no evidence to adduce and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now none to say the folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero and he is to be given a public funeral already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the esk for a piece and then brought back to tate hill pier and up the abbey steps for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff the owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave ,Dracula
no trace has ever been found of the great dog at which there is much mourning for with public opinion in its present state he would i believe be adopted by the town tomorrow will see the funeral and so will end this one more mystery of the sea ,Dracula
 augustlucy was very restless all night and i too could not sleep the storm was fearful and as it boomed loudly among the chimneypots it made me shudder when a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun strangely enough lucy did not wake but she got up twice and dressed herself fortunately each time i awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her and got her back to bed it is a very strange thing this sleepwalking for as soon as her will is thwarted in any physical way her intention if there be any disappears and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life ,Dracula
early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night there were very few people about and though the sun was bright and the air clear and fresh the big grimlooking waves that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow forced themselves in through the narrow mouth of the harbourlike a bullying man going through a crowd somehow i felt glad that jonathan was not on the sea last night but on land but oh is he on land or sea where is he and how i am getting fearfully anxious about him if i only knew what to do and could do anything ,Dracula
 augustthe funeral of the poor seacaptain today was most touching every boat in the harbour seemed to be there and the coffin was carried by captains all the way from tate hill pier up to the churchyard lucy came with me and we went early to our old seat whilst the cortge of boats went up the river to the viaduct and came down again we had a lovely view and saw the procession nearly all the way the poor fellow was laid to rest quite near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything poor lucy seemed much upset she was restless and uneasy all the time and i cannot but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her she is quite odd in one thing she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness or if there be she does not understand it herself there is an additional cause in that poor old mr swales was found dead this morning on our seat his neck being broken he had evidently as the doctor said fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder poor dear old man perhaps he had seen death with his dying eyes lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do just now she was quite upset by a little thing which i did not much heed though i am myself very fond of animals one of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog the dog is always with him they are both quiet persons and i never saw the man angry nor heard the dog bark during the service the dog would not come to its master who was on the seat with us but kept a few yards off barking and howling its master spoke to it gently and then harshly and then angrily but it would neither come nor cease to make a noise it was in a sort of fury with its eyes savage and all its hairs bristling out like a cats tail when puss is on the warpath finally the man too got angry and jumped down and kicked the dog and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed the moment it touched the stone the poor thing became quiet and fell all into a tremble it did not try to get away but crouched down quivering and cowering and was in such a pitiable state of terror that i tried though without effect to comfort it lucy was full of pity too but she did not attempt to touch the dog but looked at it in an agonised sort of way i greatly fear that she is of too supersensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble she will be dreaming of this tonight i am sure the whole agglomeration of thingsthe ship steered into port by a dead man his attitude tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads the touching funeral the dog now furious and now in terrorwill all afford material for her dreams ,Dracula
same day  oclock p moh but i am tired if it were not that i had made my diary a duty i should not open it tonight we had a lovely walk lucy after a while was in gay spirits owing i think to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse and frightened the wits out of us i believe we forgot everything except of course personal fear and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start we had a capital severe tea at robin hoods bay in a sweet little oldfashioned inn with a bowwindow right over the seaweedcovered rocks of the strand i believe we should have shocked the new woman with our appetites men are more tolerant bless them then we walked home with some or rather many stoppages to rest and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls lucy was really tired and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could the young curate came in however and mrs westenra asked him to stay for supper lucy and i had both a fight for it with the dusty miller i know it was a hard fight on my part and i am quite heroic i think that some day the bishops must get together and see about breeding up a new class of curates who dont take supper no matter how they may be pressed to and who will know when girls are tired lucy is asleep and breathing softly she has more colour in her cheeks than usual and looks oh so sweet if mr holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawingroom i wonder what he would say if he saw her now some of the new women writers will some day start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting but i suppose the new woman wont condescend in future to accept she will do the proposing herself and a nice job she will make of it too theres some consolation in that i am so happy tonight because dear lucy seems better i really believe she has turned the corner and that we are over her troubles with dreaming i should be quite happy if i only knew if jonathan god bless and keep him ,Dracula
 august  a mdiary again no sleep now so i may as well write i am too agitated to sleep we have had such an adventure such an agonising experience i fell asleep as soon as i had closed my diary suddenly i became broad awake and sat up with a horrible sense of fear upon me and of some feeling of emptiness around me the room was dark so i could not see lucys bed i stole across and felt for her the bed was empty i lit a match and found that she was not in the room the door was shut but not locked as i had left it i feared to wake her mother who has been more than usually ill lately so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her as i was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention dressinggown would mean house dress outside dressinggown and dress were both in their places thank god i said to myself she cannot be far as she is only in her nightdress i ran downstairs and looked in the sittingroom not there then i looked in all the other open rooms of the house with an evergrowing fear chilling my heart finally i came to the hall door and found it open it was not wide open but the catch of the lock had not caught the people of the house are careful to lock the door every night so i feared that lucy must have gone out as she was there was no time to think of what might happen a vague overmastering fear obscured all details i took a big heavy shawl and ran out the clock was striking one as i was in the crescent and there was not a soul in sight i ran along the north terrace but could see no sign of the white figure which i expected at the edge of the west cliff above the pier i looked across the harbour to the east cliff in the hope or feari dont know whichof seeing lucy in our favourite seat there was a bright full moon with heavy black driving clouds which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across for a moment or two i could see nothing as the shadow of a cloud obscured st marys church and all around it then as the cloud passed i could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a swordcut moved along the church and the churchyard became gradually visible whatever my expectation was it was not disappointed for there on our favourite seat the silver light of the moon struck a halfreclining figure snowy white the coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much for shadow shut down on light almost immediately but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figure shone and bent over it what it was whether man or beast i could not tell i did not wait to catch another glance but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fishmarket to the bridge which was the only way to reach the east cliff the town seemed as dead for not a soul did i see i rejoiced that it was so for i wanted no witness of poor lucys condition the time and distance seemed endless and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as i toiled up the endless steps to the abbey i must have gone fast and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead and as though every joint in my body were rusty when i got almost to the top i could see the seat and the white figure for i was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow there was undoubtedly something long and black bending over the halfreclining white figure i called in fright lucy lucy and something raised a head and from where i was i could see a white face and red gleaming eyes lucy did not answer and i ran on to the entrance of the churchyard as i entered the church was between me and the seat and for a minute or so i lost sight of her when i came in view again the cloud had passed and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that i could see lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat she was quite alone and there was not a sign of any living thing about ,Dracula
when i bent over her i could see that she was still asleep her lips were parted and she was breathingnot softly as usual with her but in long heavy gasps as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath as i came close she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar of her nightdress close around her throat whilst she did so there came a little shudder through her as though she felt the cold i flung the warm shawl over her and drew the edges tight round her neck for i dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air unclad as she was i feared to wake her all at once so in order to have my hands free that i might help her i fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safetypin but i must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it for byandby when her breathing became quieter she put her hand to her throat again and moaned when i had her carefully wrapped up i put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her at first she did not respond but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep moaning and sighing occasionally at last as time was passing fast and for many other reasons i wished to get her home at once i shook her more forcibly till finally she opened her eyes and awoke she did not seem surprised to see me as of course she did not realise all at once where she was lucy always wakes prettily and even at such a time when her body must have been chilled with cold and her mind somewhat appalled at waking unclad in a churchyard at night she did not lose her grace she trembled a little and clung to me when i told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word with the obedience of a child as we passed along the gravel hurt my feet and lucy noticed me wince she stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes but i would not however when we got to the pathway outside the churchyard where there was a puddle of water remaining from the storm i daubed my feet with mud using each foot in turn on the other so that as we went home no one in case we should meet any one should notice my bare feet ,Dracula
fortune favoured us and we got home without meeting a soul once we saw a man who seemed not quite sober passing along a street in front of us but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here steep little closes or wynds as they call them in scotland my heart beat so loud all the time that sometimes i thought i should faint i was filled with anxiety about lucy not only for her health lest she should suffer from the exposure but for her reputation in case the story should get wind when we got in and had washed our feet and had said a prayer of thankfulness together i tucked her into bed before falling asleep she askedeven imploredme not to say a word to any one even her mother about her sleepwalking adventure i hesitated at first to promise but on thinking of the state of her mothers health and how the knowledge of such a thing would fret her and thinking too of how such a story might become distortednay infallibly wouldin case it should leak out i thought it wiser to do so i hope i did right i have locked the door and the key is tied to my wrist so perhaps i shall not be again disturbed lucy is sleeping soundly the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea ,Dracula
same day noonall goes well lucy slept till i woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side the adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her on the contrary it has benefited her for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks i was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safetypin hurt her indeed it might have been serious for the skin of her throat was pierced i must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it for there are two little red points like pinpricks and on the band of her nightdress was a drop of blood when i apologised and was concerned about it she laughed and petted me and said she did not even feel it fortunately it cannot leave a scar as it is so tiny ,Dracula
same day nightwe passed a happy day the air was clear and the sun bright and there was a cool breeze we took our lunch to mulgrave woods mrs westenra driving by the road and lucy and i walking by the cliffpath and joining her at the gate i felt a little sad myself for i could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had jonathan been with me but there i must only be patient in the evening we strolled in the casino terrace and heard some good music by spohr and mackenzie and went to bed early lucy seems more restful than she has been for some time and fell asleep at once i shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before though i do not expect any trouble tonight ,Dracula
 augustmy expectations were wrong for twice during the night i was wakened by lucy trying to get out she seemed even in her sleep to be a little impatient at finding the door shut and went back to bed under a sort of protest i woke with the dawn and heard the birds chirping outside of the window lucy woke too and i was glad to see was even better than on the previous morning all her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about arthur i told her how anxious i was about jonathan and then she tried to comfort me well she succeeded somewhat for though sympathy cant alter facts it can help to make them more bearable ,Dracula
 augustanother quiet day and to bed with the key on my wrist as before again i awoke in the night and found lucy sitting up in bed still asleep pointing to the window i got up quietly and pulling aside the blind looked out it was brilliant moonlight and the soft effect of the light over the sea and skymerged together in one great silent mysterywas beautiful beyond words between me and the moonlight flitted a great bat coming and going in great whirling circles once or twice it came quite close but was i suppose frightened at seeing me and flitted away across the harbour towards the abbey when i came back from the window lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully she did not stir again all night ,Dracula
 auguston the east cliff reading and writing all day lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot as i am and it is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner this afternoon she made a funny remark we were coming home for dinner and had come to the top of the steps up from the west pier and stopped to look at the view as we generally do the setting sun low down in the sky was just dropping behind kettleness the red light was thrown over on the east cliff and the old abbey and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow we were silent for a while and suddenly lucy murmured as if to herself ,Dracula
his red eyes again they are just the same it was such an odd expression coming apropos of nothing that it quite startled me i slewed round a little so as to see lucy well without seeming to stare at her and saw that she was in a halfdreamy state with an odd look on her face that i could not quite make out so i said nothing but followed her eyes she appeared to be looking over at our own seat whereon was a dark figure seated alone i was a little startled myself for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames but a second look dispelled the illusion the red sunlight was shining on the windows of st marys church behind our seat and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved i called lucys attention to the peculiar effect and she became herself with a start but she looked sad all the same it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there we never refer to it so i said nothing and we went home to dinner lucy had a headache and went early to bed i saw her asleep and went out for a little stroll myself i walked along the cliffs to the westward and was full of sweet sadness for i was thinking of jonathan when coming homeit was then bright moonlight so bright that though the front of our part of the crescent was in shadow everything could be well seeni threw a glance up at our window and saw lucys head leaning out i thought that perhaps she was looking out for me so i opened my handkerchief and waved it she did not notice or make any movement whatever just then the moonlight crept round an angle of the building and the light fell on the window there distinctly was lucy with her head lying up against the side of the windowsill and her eyes shut she was fast asleep and by her seated on the windowsill was something that looked like a goodsized bird i was afraid she might get a chill so i ran upstairs but as i came into the room she was moving back to her bed fast asleep and breathing heavily she was holding her hand to her throat as though to protect it from cold ,Dracula
she looks so sweet as she sleeps but she is paler than is her wont and there is a drawn haggard look under her eyes which i do not like i fear she is fretting about something i wish i could find out what it is ,Dracula
 augustrose later than usual lucy was languid and tired and slept on after we had been called we had a happy surprise at breakfast arthurs father is better and wants the marriage to come off soon lucy is full of quiet joy and her mother is glad and sorry at once later on in the day she told me the cause she is grieved to lose lucy as her very own but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have some one to protect her poor dear sweet lady she confided to me that she has got her deathwarrant she has not told lucy and made me promise secrecy her doctor told her that within a few months at most she must die for her heart is weakening at any time even now a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her ah we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of lucys sleepwalking ,Dracula
 augustno diary for two whole days i have not had the heart to write some sort of shadowy pall seems to be coming over our happiness no news from jonathan and lucy seems to be growing weaker whilst her mothers hours are numbering to a close i do not understand lucys fading away as she is doing she eats well and sleeps well and enjoys the fresh air but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading and she gets weaker and more languid day by day at night i hear her gasping as if for air i keep the key of our door always fastened to my wrist at night but she gets up and walks about the room and sits at the open window last night i found her leaning out when i woke up and when i tried to wake her i could not she was in a faint when i managed to restore her she was as weak as water and cried silently between long painful struggles for breath when i asked her how she came to be at the window she shook her head and turned away i trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safetypin i looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed they are still open and if anything larger than before and the edges of them are faintly white they are like little white dots with red centres unless they heal within a day or two i shall insist on the doctor seeing about them ,Dracula

 augusti am happy today and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard lucy is ever so much better last night she slept well all night and did not disturb me once the roses seem coming back already to her cheeks though she is still sadly pale and wanlooking if she were in any way anmic i could understand it but she is not she is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness all the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her and she has just reminded me as if i needed any reminding of that night and that it was here on this very seat i found her asleep as she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her boot on the stone slab and said ,Dracula
my poor little feet didnt make much noise then i daresay poor old mr swales would have told me that it was because i didnt want to wake up geordie as she was in such a communicative humour i asked her if she had dreamed at all that night before she answered that sweet puckered look came into her forehead which arthuri call him arthur from her habitsays he loves and indeed i dont wonder that he does then she went on in a halfdreaming kind of way as if trying to recall it to herself ,Dracula
i didnt quite dream but it all seemed to be real i only wanted to be here in this spoti dont know why for i was afraid of somethingi dont know what i remember though i suppose i was asleep passing through the streets and over the bridge a fish leaped as i went by and i leaned over to look at it and i heard a lot of dogs howlingthe whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at onceas i went up the steps then i had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes just as we saw in the sunset and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once and then i seemed sinking into deep green water and there was a singing in my ears as i have heard there is to drowning men and then everything seemed passing away from me my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air i seem to remember that once the west lighthouse was right under me and then there was a sort of agonising feeling as if i were in an earthquake and i came back and found you shaking my body i saw you do it before i felt you ,Dracula
then she began to laugh it seemed a little uncanny to me and i listened to her breathlessly i did not quite like it and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject so we drifted on to other subjects and lucy was like her old self again when we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up and her pale cheeks were really more rosy her mother rejoiced when she saw her and we all spent a very happy evening together ,Dracula
 augustjoy joy joy although not all joy at last news of jonathan the dear fellow has been ill that is why he did not write i am not afraid to think it or say it now that i know mr hawkins sent me on the letter and wrote himself oh so kindly i am to leave in the morning and go over to jonathan and to help to nurse him if necessary and to bring him home mr hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there i have cried over the good sisters letter till i can feel it wet against my bosom where it lies it is of jonathan and must be next my heart for he is in my heart my journey is all mapped out and my luggage ready i am only taking one change of dress lucy will bring my trunk to london and keep it till i send for it for it may be that  i must write no more i must keep it to say to jonathan my husband the letter that he has seen and touched must comfort me till we meet ,Dracula
i write by desire of mr jonathan harker who is himself not strong enough to write though progressing well thanks to god and st joseph and ste mary he has been under our care for nearly six weeks suffering from a violent brain fever he wishes me to convey his love and to say that by this post i write for him to mr peter hawkins exeter to say with his dutiful respects that he is sorry for his delay and that all of his work is completed he will require some few weeks rest in our sanatorium in the hills but will then return he wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him and that he would like to pay for his staying here so that others who need shall not be wanting for help ,Dracula
p smy patient being asleep i open this to let you know something more he has told me all about you and that you are shortly to be his wife all blessings to you both he has had some fearful shockso says our doctorand in his delirium his ravings have been dreadful of wolves and poison and blood of ghosts and demons and i fear to say of what be careful with him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away we should have written long ago but we knew nothing of his friends and there was on him nothing that any one could understand he came in the train from klausenburg and the guard was told by the stationmaster there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home seeing from his violent demeanour that he was english they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached ,Dracula
be assured that he is well cared for he has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness he is truly getting on well and i have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself but be careful of him for safetys sake there are i pray god and st joseph and ste mary many many happy years for you both ,Dracula
 auguststrange and sudden change in renfield last night about eight oclock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting the attendant was struck by his manner and knowing my interest in him encouraged him to talk he is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile but tonight the man tells me he was quite haughty would not condescend to talk with him at all all he would say was ,Dracula
the attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him if so we must look out for squalls for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous the combination is a dreadful one at nine oclock i visited him myself his attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant in his sublime selffeeling the difference between myself and attendant seemed to him as nothing it looks like religious mania and he will soon think that he himself is god these infinitesimal distinctions between man and man are too paltry for an omnipotent being how these madmen give themselves away the real god taketh heed lest a sparrow fall but the god created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow oh if men only knew ,Dracula
for half an hour or more renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree i did not pretend to be watching him but i kept strict observation all the same all at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know so well he became quite quiet and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly and looked into space with lacklustre eyes i thought i would find out if his apathy were real or only assumed and tried to lead him to talk of his pets a theme which had never failed to excite his attention at first he made no reply but at length said testily ,Dracula
i am weary tonight and low in spirits i cannot but think of lucy and how different things might have been if i dont sleep at once chloral the modern morpheuschclo ho i must be careful not to let it grow into a habit no i shall take none tonight i have thought of lucy and i shall not dishonour her by mixing the two if need be tonight shall be sleepless ,Dracula
laterglad i made the resolution gladder that i kept to it i had lain tossing about and had heard the clock strike only twice when the nightwatchman came to me sent up from the ward to say that renfield had escaped i threw on my clothes and ran down at once my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers the attendant was waiting for me he said he had seen him not ten minutes before seemingly asleep in his bed when he had looked through the observationtrap in the door his attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out he ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window and had at once sent up for me he was only in his nightgear and cannot be far off the attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door he is a bulky man and couldnt get through the window i am thin so with his aid i got out but feet foremost and as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt the attendant told me the patient had gone to the left and had taken a straight line so i ran as quickly as i could as i got through the belt of trees i saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house ,Dracula
i ran back at once told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of carfax in case our friend might be dangerous i got a ladder myself and crossing the wall dropped down on the other side i could see renfields figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house so i ran after him on the far side of the house i found him pressed close against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel he was talking apparently to some one but i was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying lest i might frighten him and he should run off chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic when the fit of escaping is upon him after a few minutes however i could see that he did not take note of anything around him and so ventured to draw nearer to himthe more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in i heard him say ,Dracula
i am here to do your bidding master i am your slave and you will reward me for i shall be faithful i have worshipped you long and afar off now that you are near i await your commands and you will not pass me by will you dear master in your distribution of good things ,Dracula
he is a selfish old beggar anyhow he thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a real presence his manias make a startling combination when we closed in on him he fought like a tiger he is immensely strong for he was more like a wild beast than a man i never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and i hope i shall not again it is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time with strength and determination like his he might have done wild work before he was caged he is safe now at any rate jack sheppard himself couldnt get free from the straitwaistcoat that keeps him restrained and hes chained to the wall in the padded room his cries are at times awful but the silences that follow are more deadly still for he means murder in every turn and movement ,Dracula
i know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at whitby well my dear i got to hull all right and caught the boat to hamburg and then the train on here i feel that i can hardly recall anything of the journey except that i knew i was coming to jonathan and that as i should have to do some nursing i had better get all the sleep i could i found my dear one oh so thin and pale and weaklooking all the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes and that quiet dignity which i told you was in his face has vanished he is only a wreck of himself and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past at least he wants me to believe so and i shall never ask he has had some terrible shock and i fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it sister agatha who is a good creature and a born nurse tells me that he raved of dreadful things whilst he was off his head i wanted her to tell me what they were but she would only cross herself and say she would never tell that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of god and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them she should respect her trust she is a sweet good soul and the next day when she saw i was troubled she opened up the subject again and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about added i can tell you this much my dear that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself and you as his wife to be have no cause to be concerned he has not forgotten you or what he owes to you his fear was of great and terrible things which no mortal can treat of i do believe the dear soul thought i might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl the idea of my being jealous about jonathan and yet my dear let me whisper i felt a thrill of joy through me when i knew that no other woman was a cause of trouble i am now sitting by his bedside where i can see his face while he sleeps he is waking ,Dracula
when he woke he asked me for his coat as he wanted to get something from the pocket i asked sister agatha and she brought all his things i saw that amongst them was his notebook and was going to ask him to let me look at itfor i knew then that i might find some clue to his troublebut i suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes for he sent me over to the window saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment then he called me back and when i came he had his hand over the notebook and he said to me very solemnly ,Dracula
wilhelminai knew then that he was in deadly earnest for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry himyou know dear my ideas of the trust between husband and wife there should be no secret no concealment i have had a great shock and when i try to think of what it is i feel my head spin round and i do not know if it was all real or the dreaming of a madman you know i have had brain fever and that is to be mad the secret is here and i do not want to know it i want to take up my life here with our marriage for my dear we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete are you willing wilhelmina to share my ignorance here is the book take it and keep it read it if you will but never let me know unless indeed some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake sane or mad recorded here he fell back exhausted and i put the book under his pillow and kissed him i have asked sister agatha to beg the superior to let our wedding be this afternoon and am waiting her reply ,Dracula
lucy the time has come and gone i feel very solemn but very very happy jonathan woke a little after the hour and all was ready and he sat up in bed propped up with pillows he answered his i will firmly and strongly i could hardly speak my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me the dear sisters were so kind please god i shall never never forget them nor the grave and sweet responsibilities i have taken upon me i must tell you of my wedding present when the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husbandoh lucy it is the first time i have written the words my husbandleft me alone with my husband i took the book from under his pillow and wrapped it up in white paper and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck and sealed it over the knot with sealingwax and for my seal i used my wedding ring then i kissed it and showed it to my husband and told him that i would keep it so and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other that i would never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty then he took my hand in his and oh lucy it was the first time he took his wifes hand and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world and that he would go through all the past again to win it if need be the poor dear meant to have said a part of the past but he cannot think of time yet and i shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month but the year ,Dracula
well my dear what could i say i could only tell him that i was the happiest woman in all the wide world and that i had nothing to give him except myself my life and my trust and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life and my dear when he kissed me and drew me to him with his poor weak hands it was like a very solemn pledge between us ,Dracula
lucy dear do you know why i tell you all this it is not only because it is all sweet to me but because you have been and are very dear to me it was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life i want you to see now and with the eyes of a very happy wife whither duty has led me so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as i am my dear please almighty god your life may be all it promises a long day of sunshine with no harsh wind no forgetting duty no distrust i must not wish you no pain for that can never be but i do hope you will be always as happy as i am now goodbye my dear i shall post this at once and perhaps write you very soon again i must stop for jonathan is wakingi must attend to my husband ,Dracula
oceans of love and millions of kisses and may you soon be in your own home with your husband i wish you could be coming home soon enough to stay with us here the strong air would soon restore jonathan it has quite restored me i have an appetite like a cormorant am full of life and sleep well you will be glad to know that i have quite given up walking in my sleep i think i have not stirred out of my bed for a week that is when i once got into it at night arthur says i am getting fat by the way i forgot to tell you that arthur is here we have such walks and drives and rides and rowing and tennis and fishing together and i love him more than ever he tells me that he loves me more but i doubt that for at first he told me that he couldnt love me more than he did then but this is nonsense there he is calling to me so no more just at present from your loving ,Dracula
 augustthe case of renfield grows even more interesting he has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion for the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent then one night just as the moon rose he grew quiet and kept murmuring to himself now i can wait now i can wait the attendant came to tell me so i ran down at once to have a look at him he was still in the straitwaistcoat and in the padded room but the suffused look had gone from his face and his eyes had something of their old pleadingi might almost say cringingsoftness i was satisfied with his present condition and directed him to be relieved the attendants hesitated but finally carried out my wishes without protest it was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust for coming close to me he said in a whisper all the while looking furtively at them ,Dracula
it was soothing somehow to the feelings to find myself dissociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the others but all the same i do not follow his thought am i to take it that i have anything in common with him so that we are as it were to stand together or has he to gain from me some good so stupendous that my wellbeing is needful to him i must find out later on tonight he will not speak even the offer of a kitten or even a fullgrown cat will not tempt him he will only say i dont take any stock in cats i have more to think of now and i can wait i can wait ,Dracula
after a while i left him the attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn and that then he began to get uneasy and at length violent until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma ,Dracula
 three nights has the same thing happenedviolent all day then quiet from moonrise to sunrise i wish i could get some clue to the cause it would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went happy thought we shall tonight play sane wits against mad ones he escaped before without our help tonight he shall escape with it we shall give him a chance and have the men ready to follow in case they are required ,Dracula
 augustthe unexpected always happens how well disraeli knew life our bird when he found the cage open would not fly so all our subtle arrangements were for nought at any rate we have proved one thing that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time we shall in future be able to ease his bonds for a few hours each day i have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room when once he is quiet until an hour before sunrise the poor souls body will enjoy the relief even if his mind cannot appreciate it hark the unexpected again i am called the patient has once more escaped ,Dracula
lateranother night adventure renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage i sent word for the attendants to follow again he went into the grounds of the deserted house and we found him in the same place pressed against the old chapel door when he saw me he became furious and had not the attendants seized him in time he would have tried to kill me as we were holding him a strange thing happened he suddenly redoubled his efforts and then as suddenly grew calm i looked round instinctively but could see nothing then i caught the patients eye and followed it but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlit sky except a big bat which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west bats usually wheel and flit about but this one seemed to go straight on as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own the patient grew calmer every instant and presently said ,Dracula
hillingham  augusti must imitate mina and keep writing things down then we can have long talks when we do meet i wonder when it will be i wish she were with me again for i feel so unhappy last night i seemed to be dreaming again just as i was at whitby perhaps it is the change of air or getting home again it is all dark and horrid to me for i can remember nothing but i am full of vague fear and i feel so weak and worn out when arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me and i hadnt the spirit to try to be cheerful i wonder if i could sleep in mothers room tonight i shall make an excuse and try ,Dracula
 augustanother bad night mother did not seem to take to my proposal she seems not too well herself and doubtless she fears to worry me i tried to keep awake and succeeded for a while but when the clock struck twelve it waked me from a doze so i must have been falling asleep there was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window but i did not mind it and as i remember no more i suppose i must then have fallen asleep more bad dreams i wish i could remember them this morning i am horribly weak my face is ghastly pale and my throat pains me it must be something wrong with my lungs for i dont seem ever to get air enough i shall try to cheer up when arthur comes or else i know he will be miserable to see me so ,Dracula
i want you to do me a favour lucy is ill that is she has no special disease but she looks awful and is getting worse every day i have asked her if there is any cause i do not dare to ask her mother for to disturb the poor ladys mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal mrs westenra has confided to me that her doom is spokendisease of the heartthough poor lucy does not know it yet i am sure that there is something preying on my dear girls mind i am almost distracted when i think of her to look at her gives me a pang i told her i should ask you to see her and though she demurred at firsti know why old fellowshe finally consented it will be a painful task for you i know old friend but it is for her sake and i must not hesitate to ask or you to act you are to come to lunch at hillingham tomorrow two oclock so as not to arouse any suspicion in mrs westenra and after lunch lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you i shall come in for tea and we can go away together i am filled with anxiety and want to consult with you alone as soon as i can after you have seen her do not fail ,Dracula
with regard to miss westenras health i hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that i know of at the same time i am not by any means satisfied with her appearance she is woefully different from what she was when i saw her last of course you must bear in mind that i did not have full opportunity of examination such as i should wish our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over i had better tell you exactly what happened leaving you to draw in a measure your own conclusions i shall then say what i have done and propose doing ,Dracula
i found miss westenra in seemingly gay spirits her mother was present and in a few seconds i made up my mind that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious i have no doubt she guesses if she does not know what need of caution there is we lunched alone and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful we got as some kind of reward for our labours some real cheerfulness amongst us then mrs westenra went to lie down and lucy was left with me we went into her boudoir and till we got there her gaiety remained for the servants were coming and going as soon as the door was closed however the mask fell from her face and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh and hid her eyes with her hand when i saw that her high spirits had failed i at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis she said to me very sweetly ,Dracula
i cannot tell you how i loathe talking about myself i reminded her that a doctors confidence was sacred but that you were grievously anxious about her she caught on to my meaning at once and settled that matter in a word tell arthur everything you choose i do not care for myself but all for him so i am quite free ,Dracula
i could easily see that she is somewhat bloodless but i could not see the usual anmic signs and by a chance i was actually able to test the quality of her blood for in opening a window which was stiff a cord gave way and she cut her hand slightly with broken glass it was a slight matter in itself but it gave me an evident chance and i secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them the qualitative analysis gives a quite normal condition and shows i should infer in itself a vigorous state of health in other physical matters i was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety but as there must be a cause somewhere i have come to the conclusion that it must be something mental she complains of difficulty in breathing satisfactorily at times and of heavy lethargic sleep with dreams that frighten her but regarding which she can remember nothing she says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep and that when in whitby the habit came back and that once she walked out in the night and went to east cliff where miss murray found her but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned i am in doubt and so have done the best thing i know of i have written to my old friend and master professor van helsing of amsterdam who knows as much about obscure diseases as any one in the world i have asked him to come over and as you told me that all things were to be at your charge i have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to miss westenra this my dear fellow is in obedience to your wishes for i am only too proud and happy to do anything i can for her van helsing would i know do anything for me for a personal reason so no matter on what ground he comes we must accept his wishes he is a seemingly arbitrary man but this is because he knows what he is talking about better than any one else he is a philosopher and a metaphysician and one of the most advanced scientists of his day and he has i believe an absolutely open mind this with an iron nerve a temper of the icebrook an indomitable resolution selfcommand and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings and the kindliest and truest heart that beatsthese form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankindwork both in theory and practice for his views are as wide as his allembracing sympathy i tell you these facts that you may know why i have such confidence in him i have asked him to come at once i shall see miss westenra tomorrow again she is to meet me at the stores so that i may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my call ,Dracula
when i have received your letter i am already coming to you by good fortune i can leave just at once without wrong to any of those who have trusted me were fortune other then it were bad for those who have trusted for i come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear tell your friend that when that time you suck from my wound so swiftly the poison of the gangrene from that knife that our other friend too nervous let slip you did more for him when he wants my aids and you call for them than all his great fortune could do but it is pleasure added to do for him your friend it is to you that i come have then rooms for me at the great eastern hotel so that i may be near to hand and please it so arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on tomorrow for it is likely that i may have to return here that night but if need be i shall come again in three days and stay longer if it must till then goodbye my friend john ,Dracula
van helsing has come and gone he came on with me to hillingham and found that by lucys discretion her mother was lunching out so that we were alone with her van helsing made a very careful examination of the patient he is to report to me and i shall advise you for of course i was not present all the time he is i fear much concerned but says he must think when i told him of our friendship and how you trust to me in the matter he said you must tell him all you think tell him what i think if you can guess it if you will nay i am not jesting this is no jest but life and death perhaps more i asked what he meant by that for he was very serious this was when we had come back to town and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to amsterdam he would not give me any further clue you must not be angry with me art because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good he will speak plainly enough when the time comes be sure so i told him i would simply write an account of our visit just as if i were doing a descriptive special article for the daily telegraph he seemed not to notice but remarked that the smuts in london were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here i am to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly make it in any case i am to have a letter ,Dracula
well as to the visit lucy was more cheerful than on the day i first saw her and certainly looked better she had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you and her breathing was normal she was very sweet to the professor as she always is and tried to make him feel at ease though i could see that the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it i believe van helsing saw it too for i saw the quick look under his bushy brows that i knew of old then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite geniality that i could see poor lucys pretense of animation merge into reality then without any seeming change he brought the conversation gently round to his visit and suavely said ,Dracula
my dear young miss i have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved that is much my dear ever were there that which i do not see they told me you were down in the spirit and that you were of a ghastly pale to them i say pouf and he snapped his fingers at me and went on but you and i shall show them how wrong they are how can heand he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which once he pointed me out to his class on or rather after a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me ofknow anything of a young ladies he has his madams to play with and to bring them back to happiness and to those that love them it is much to do and oh but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happiness but the young ladies he has no wife nor daughter and the young do not tell themselves to the young but to the old like me who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them so my dear we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden whiles you and i have little talk all to ourselves i took the hint and strolled about and presently the professor came to the window and called me in he looked grave but said i have made careful examination but there is no functional cause with you i agree that there has been much blood lost it has been but is not but the conditions of her are in no way anmic i have asked her to send me her maid that i may ask just one or two question that so i may not chance to miss nothing i know well what she will say and yet there is cause there is always cause for everything i must go back home and think you must send to me the telegram every day and if there be cause i shall come again the diseasefor not to be all well is a diseaseinterest me and the sweet young dear she interest me too she charm me and for her if not for you or disease i come ,Dracula
as i tell you he would not say a word more even when we were alone and so now art you know all i know i shall keep stern watch i trust your poor father is rallying it must be a terrible thing to you my dear old fellow to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you i know your idea of duty to your father and you are right to stick to it but if need be i shall send you word to come at once to lucy so do not be overanxious unless you hear from me ,Dracula
 septemberzophagous patient still keeps up our interest in him he had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless the attendant knew the symptoms and at once summoned aid fortunately the men came at a run and were just in time for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him in about five minutes however he began to get more and more quiet and finally sank into a sort of melancholy in which state he has remained up to now the attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling i found my hands full when i got in attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him indeed i can quite understand the effect for the sounds disturbed even me though i was some distance away it is now after the dinnerhour of the asylum and as yet my patient sits in a corner brooding with a dull sullen woebegone look in his face which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly i cannot quite understand it ,Dracula
lateranother change in my patient at five oclock i looked in on him and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be he was catching flies and eating them and was keeping note of his capture by making nailmarks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding when he saw me he came over and apologised for his bad conduct and asked me in a very humble cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his notebook again i thought it well to humour him so he is back in his room with the window open he has the sugar of his tea spread out on the windowsill and is reaping quite a harvest of flies he is not now eating them but putting them into a box as of old and is already examining the corners of his room to find a spider i tried to get him to talk about the past few days for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me but he would not rise for a moment or two he looked very sad and said in a sort of faraway voice as though saying it rather to himself than to me ,Dracula
all over all over he has deserted me no hope for me now unless i do it for myself then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way he said doctor wont you be very good to me and let me have a little more sugar i think it would be good for me ,Dracula
yes the flies like it too and i like the flies therefore i like it and there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue i procured him a double supply and left him as happy a man as i suppose any in the world i wish i could fathom his mind ,Dracula
midnightanother change in him i had been to see miss westenra whom i found much better and had just returned and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset when once more i heard him yelling as his room is on this side of the house i could hear it better than in the morning it was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over london with its lurid lights and inky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water and to realise all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building with its wealth of breathing misery and my own desolate heart to endure it all i reached him just as the sun was going down and from his window saw the red disc sink as it sank he became less and less frenzied and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him an inert mass on the floor it is wonderful however what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him i signalled to the attendants not to hold him for i was anxious to see what he would do he went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar then he took his flybox and emptied it outside and threw away the box then he shut the window and crossing over sat down on his bed all this surprised me so i asked him are you not going to keep flies any more ,Dracula
no said he i am sick of all that rubbish he certainly is a wonderfully interesting study i wish i could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion stop there may be a clue after all if we can find why today his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset can it be that there is a malign influence of the sun at periods which affects certain naturesas at times the moon does others we shall see ,Dracula
my news today is not so good lucy this morning had gone back a bit there is however one good thing which has arisen from it mrs westenra was naturally anxious concerning lucy and has consulted me professionally about her i took advantage of the opportunity and told her that my old master van helsing the great specialist was coming to stay with me and that i would put her in his charge conjointly with myself so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly for a shock to her would mean sudden death and this in lucys weak condition might be disastrous to her we are hedged in with difficulties all of us my poor old fellow but please god we shall come through them all right if any need i shall write so that if you do not hear from me take it for granted that i am simply waiting for news in haste ,Dracula
right my friend he said quite right better he not know as yet perhaps he shall never know i pray so but if it be needed then he shall know all and my good friend john let me caution you you deal with the madmen all men are mad in some way or the other and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen so deal with gods madmen toothe rest of the world you tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it you tell them not what you think so you shall keep knowledge in its place where it may restwhere it may gather its kind around it and breed you and i shall keep as yet what we know here and here he touched me on the heart and on the forehead and then touched himself the same way i have for myself thoughts at the present later i shall unfold to you ,Dracula
my friend john when the corn is grown even before it has ripenedwhile the milk of its motherearth is in him and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold the husbandman he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands and blow away the green chaff and say to you look hes good corn he will make good crop when the time comes i did not see the application and told him so for reply he reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully as he used long ago to do at lectures and said the good husbandman tell you so then because he knows but not till then but you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow that is for the children who play at husbandry and not for those who take it as of the work of their life see you now friend john i have sown my corn and nature has her work to do in making it sprout if he sprout at all theres some promise and i wait till the ear begins to swell he broke off for he evidently saw that i understood then he went on and very gravely ,Dracula
you were always a careful student and your casebook was ever more full than the rest you were only student then now you are master and i trust that good habit have not fail remember my friend that knowledge is stronger than memory and we should not trust the weaker even if you have not kept the good practise let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may bemind i say may beof such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam as your peoples say take then good note of it nothing is too small i counsel you put down in record even your doubts and surmises hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess we learn from failure not from success ,Dracula
when i described lucys symptomsthe same as before but infinitely more markedhe looked very grave but said nothing he took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade as he once called in one of his lectures the equipment of a professor of the healing craft when we were shown in mrs westenra met us she was alarmed but not nearly so much as i expected to find her nature in one of her beneficent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors here in a case where any shock may prove fatal matters are so ordered that from some cause or other the things not personaleven the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attacheddo not seem to reach her it is something like the way dame nature gathers round a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact if this be an ordered selfishness then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of ,Dracula
i used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology and laid down a rule that she should not be present with lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required she assented readily so readily that i saw again the hand of nature fighting for life van helsing and i were shown up to lucys room if i was shocked when i saw her yesterday i was horrified when i saw her today she was ghastly chalkily pale the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums and the bones of her face stood out prominently her breathing was painful to see or hear van helsings face grew set as marble and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose lucy lay motionless and did not seem to have strength to speak so for a while we were all silent then van helsing beckoned to me and we went gently out of the room the instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door which was open then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door my god he said this is dreadful there is no time to be lost she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the hearts action as it should be there must be transfusion of blood at once is it you or me ,Dracula
i went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock at the halldoor when we reached the hall the maid had just opened the door and arthur was stepping quickly in he rushed up to me saying in an eager whisper ,Dracula
jack i was so anxious i read between the lines of your letter and have been in an agony the dad was better so i ran down here to see for myself is not that gentleman dr van helsing i am so thankful to you sir for coming when first the professors eye had lit upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time but now as he took in his stalwart proportions and recognised the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him his eyes gleamed without a pause he said to him gravely as he held out his hand ,Dracula
sir you have come in time you are the lover of our dear miss she is bad very very bad nay my child do not go like that for he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting you are to help her you can do more than any that live and your courage is your best help ,Dracula
what can i do asked arthur hoarsely tell me and i shall do it my life is hers and i would give the last drop of blood in my body for her the professor has a strongly humorous side and i could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer ,Dracula
what shall i do there was fire in his eyes and his open nostril quivered with intent van helsing slapped him on the shoulder come he said you are a man and it is a man we want you are better than me better than my friend john arthur looked bewildered and the professor went on by explaining in a kindly way ,Dracula
young miss is bad very bad she wants blood and blood she must have or die my friend john and i have consulted and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of bloodto transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him john was to give his blood as he is the more young and strong than mehere arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silencebut now you are here you are more good than us old or young who toil much in the world of thought our nerves are not so calm and our blood not so bright than yours arthur turned to him and said ,Dracula
good boy said van helsing in the notsofaroff you will be happy that you have done all for her you love come now and be silent you shall kiss her once before it is done but then you must go and you must leave at my sign say no word to madame you know how it is with her there must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one come ,Dracula
we all went up to lucys room arthur by direction remained outside lucy turned her head and looked at us but said nothing she was not asleep but she was simply too weak to make the effort her eyes spoke to us that was all van helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight then he mixed a narcotic and coming over to the bed said cheerily ,Dracula
it astonished me how long the drug took to act this in fact marked the extent of her weakness the time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids at last however the narcotic began to manifest its potency and she fell into a deep sleep when the professor was satisfied he called arthur into the room and bade him strip off his coat then he added you may take that one little kiss whiles i bring over the table friend john help to me so neither of us looked whilst he bent over her ,Dracula
then with swiftness but with absolute method van helsing performed the operation as the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor lucys cheeks and through arthurs growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine after a bit i began to grow anxious for the loss of blood was telling on arthur strong man as he was it gave me an idea of what a terrible strain lucys system must have undergone that what weakened arthur only partially restored her but the professors face was set and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on arthur i could hear my own heart beat presently he said in a soft voice do not stir an instant it is enough you attend him i will look to her when all was over i could see how much arthur was weakened i dressed the wound and took his arm to bring him away when van helsing spoke without turning roundthe man seems to have eyes in the back of his head ,Dracula
the brave lover i think deserve another kiss which he shall have presently and as he had now finished his operation he adjusted the pillow to the patients head as he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat buckled with an old diamond buckle which her lover had given her was dragged a little up and showed a red mark on her throat arthur did not notice it but i could hear the deep hiss of indrawn breath which is one of van helsings ways of betraying emotion he said nothing at the moment but turned to me saying now take down our brave young lover give him of the port wine and let him lie down a while he must then go home and rest sleep much and eat much that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love he must not stay here hold a moment i may take it sir that you are anxious of result then bring it with you that in all ways the operation is successful you have saved her life this time and you can go home and rest easy in mind that all that can be is i shall tell her all when she is well she shall love you none the less for what you have done goodbye ,Dracula
when arthur had gone i went back to the room lucy was sleeping gently but her breathing was stronger i could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved by the bedside sat van helsing looking at her intently the velvet band again covered the red mark i asked the professor in a whisper ,Dracula
i have not examined it yet i answered and then and there proceeded to loose the band just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures not large but not wholesomelooking there was no sign of disease but the edges were white and wornlooking as if by some trituration it at once occurred to me that this wound or whatever it was might be the means of that manifest loss of blood but i abandoned the idea as soon as formed for such a thing could not be the whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion ,Dracula
well said i i can make nothing of it the professor stood up i must go back to amsterdam tonight he said there are books and things there which i want you must remain here all the night and you must not let your sight pass from her ,Dracula
we are the best nurses you and i you keep watch all night see that she is well fed and that nothing disturbs her you must not sleep all the night later on we can sleep you and i i shall be back as soon as possible and then we may begin ,Dracula
 septemberi sat up all night with lucy the opiate worked itself off towards dusk and she waked naturally she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation her spirits even were good and she was full of a happy vivacity but i could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone when i told mrs westenra that dr van helsing had directed that i should sit up with her she almost poohpoohed the idea pointing out her daughters renewed strength and excellent spirits i was firm however and made preparations for my long vigil when her maid had prepared her for the night i came in having in the meantime had supper and took a seat by the bedside she did not in any way make objection but looked at me gratefully whenever i caught her eye after a long spell she seemed sinking off to sleep but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off this was repeated several times with greater effort and with shorter pauses as the time moved on it was apparent that she did not want to sleep so i tackled the subject at once ,Dracula
all night long i watched by her she never stirred but slept on and on in a deep tranquil lifegiving healthgiving sleep her lips were slightly parted and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum there was a smile on her face and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind ,Dracula
in the early morning her maid came and i left her in her care and took myself back home for i was anxious about many things i sent a short wire to van helsing and to arthur telling them of the excellent result of the operation my own work with its manifold arrears took me all day to clear off it was dark when i was able to inquire about my zophagous patient the report was good he had been quite quiet for the past day and night a telegram came from van helsing at amsterdam whilst i was at dinner suggesting that i should be at hillingham tonight as it might be well to be at hand and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning ,Dracula
 septemberi was pretty tired and worn out when i got to hillingham for two nights i had hardly had a wink of sleep and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion lucy was up and in cheerful spirits when she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said ,Dracula
no sitting up tonight for you you are worn out i am quite well again indeed i am and if there is to be any sitting up it is i who will sit up with you i would not argue the point but went and had my supper lucy came with me and enlivened by her charming presence i made an excellent meal and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port then lucy took me upstairs and showed me a room next her own where a cozy fire was burning now she said you must stay here i shall leave this door open and my door too you can lie on the sofa for i know that nothing would induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon if i want anything i shall call out and you can come to me at once i could not but acquiesce for i was dogtired and could not have sat up had i tried so on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything i lay on the sofa and forgot all about everything ,Dracula
 septemberi feel so happy tonight i have been so miserably weak that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky somehow arthur feels very very close to me i seem to feel his presence warm about me i suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn our inner eyes and sympathy on ourselves whilst health and strength give love rein and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills i know where my thoughts are if arthur only knew my dear my dear your ears must tingle as you sleep as mine do waking oh the blissful rest of last night how i slept with that dear good dr seward watching me and tonight i shall not fear to sleep since he is close at hand and within call thank everybody for being so good to me thank god goodnight arthur ,Dracula
as i raised the blind and the morning sunlight flooded the room i heard the professors low hiss of inspiration and knowing its rarity a deadly fear shot through my heart as i passed over he moved back and his exclamation of horror gott in himmel needed no enforcement from his agonised face he raised his hand and pointed to the bed and his iron face was drawn and ashen white i felt my knees begin to tremble ,Dracula
there on the bed seemingly in a swoon lay poor lucy more horribly white and wanlooking than ever even the lips were white and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness van helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habit stood to him and he put it down again softly quick he said bring the brandy i flew to the diningroom and returned with the decanter he wetted the poor white lips with it and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart he felt her heart and after a few moments of agonising suspense said ,Dracula
it is not too late it beats though but feebly all our work is undone we must begin again there is no young arthur here now i have to call on you yourself this time friend john as he spoke he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments for transfusion i had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirtsleeve there was no possibility of an opiate just at present and no need of one and so without a moments delay we began the operation after a timeit did not seem a short time either for the draining away of ones blood no matter how willingly it be given is a terrible feelingvan helsing held up a warning finger do not stir he said but i fear that with growing strength she may wake and that would make danger oh so much danger but i shall precaution take i shall give hypodermic injection of morphia he proceeded then swiftly and deftly to carry out his intent the effect on lucy was not bad for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotic sleep it was with a feeling of personal pride that i could see a faint tinge of colour steal back into the pallid cheeks and lips no man knows till he experiences it what it is to feel his own lifeblood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves ,Dracula
when we stopped the operation he attended to lucy whilst i applied digital pressure to my own incision i laid down whilst i waited his leisure to attend to me for i felt faint and a little sick byandby he bound up my wound and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself as i was leaving the room he came after me and half whispered ,Dracula
i followed out his orders for i knew how right and wise they were i had done my part and now my next duty was to keep up my strength i felt very weak and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred i fell asleep on the sofa however wondering over and over again how lucy had made such a retrograde movement and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it i think i must have continued my wonder in my dreams for sleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged exhausted appearance of their edgestiny though they were ,Dracula
lucy slept well into the day and when she woke she was fairly well and strong though not nearly so much so as the day before when van helsing had seen her he went out for a walk leaving me in charge with strict injunctions that i was not to leave her for a moment i could hear his voice in the hall asking the way to the nearest telegraph office ,Dracula
lucy chatted with me freely and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened i tried to keep her amused and interested when her mother came up to see her she did not seem to notice any change whatever but said to me gratefully ,Dracula
we owe you so much dr seward for all you have done but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself you are looking pale yourself you want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit that you do as she spoke lucy turned crimson though it was only momentarily for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long such an unwonted drain to the head the reaction came in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me i smiled and nodded and laid my finger on my lips with a sigh she sank back amid her pillows ,Dracula
van helsing returned in a couple of hours and presently said to me now you go home and eat much and drink enough make yourself strong i stay here tonight and i shall sit up with little miss myself you and i must watch the case and we must have none other to know i have grave reasons no do not ask them think what you will do not fear to think even the most notprobable goodnight ,Dracula
in the hall two of the maids came to me and asked if they or either of them might not sit up with miss lucy they implored me to let them and when i said it was dr van helsings wish that either he or i should sit up they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the foreign gentleman i was much touched by their kindness perhaps it is because i am weak at present and perhaps because it was on lucys account that their devotion was manifested for over and over again have i seen similar instances of womans kindness i got back here in time for a late dinner went my roundsall well and set this down whilst waiting for sleep it is coming ,Dracula
 septemberthis afternoon i went over to hillingham found van helsing in excellent spirits and lucy much better shortly after i had arrived a big parcel from abroad came for the professor he opened it with much impressmentassumed of courseand showed a great bundle of white flowers ,Dracula
yes my dear but not for you to play with these are medicines here lucy made a wry face nay but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form so you need not snub that so charming nose or i shall point out to my friend arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loves so much distort aha my pretty miss that bring the so nice nose all straight again this is medicinal but you do not know how i put him in your window i make pretty wreath and hang him round your neck so that you sleep well oh yes they like the lotus flower make your trouble forgotten it smell so like the waters of lethe and of that fountain of youth that the conquistadores sought for in the floridas and find him all too late ,Dracula
no trifling with me i never jest there is grim purpose in all i do and i warn you that you do not thwart me take care for the sake of others if not for your own then seeing poor lucy scared as she might well be he went on more gently oh little miss my dear do not fear me i only do for your good but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers see i place them myself in your room i make myself the wreath that you are to wear but hush no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions we must obey and silence is a part of obedience and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you now sit still awhile come with me friend john and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic which is all the way from haarlem where my friend vanderpool raise herb in his glasshouses all the year i had to telegraph yesterday or they would not have been here ,Dracula
we went into the room taking the flowers with us the professors actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopoeia that i ever heard of first he fastened up the windows and latched them securely next taking a handful of the flowers he rubbed them all over the sashes as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the door above below and at each side and round the fireplace in the same way it all seemed grotesque to me and presently i said ,Dracula
tonight i can sleep in peace and sleep i wanttwo nights of travel much reading in the day between and much anxiety on the day to follow and a night to sit up without to wink tomorrow in the morning early you call for me and we come together to see our pretty miss so much more strong for my spell which i have work ho ho ,Dracula
he seemed so confident that i remembering my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result felt awe and vague terror it must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend but i felt it all the more like unshed tears ,Dracula
 septemberhow good they all are to me i quite love that dear dr van helsing i wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers he positively frightened me he was so fierce and yet he must have been right for i feel comfort from them already somehow i do not dread being alone tonight and i can go to sleep without fear i shall not mind any flapping outside the window oh the terrible struggle that i have had against sleep so often of late the pain of the sleeplessness or the pain of the fear of sleep with such unknown horrors as it has for me how blessed are some people whose lives have no fears no dreads to whom sleep is a blessing that comes nightly and brings nothing but sweet dreams well here i am tonight hoping for sleep and lying like ophelia in the play with virgin crants and maiden strewments i never liked garlic before but tonight it is delightful there is peace in its smell i feel sleep coming already goodnight everybody ,Dracula
let all be put down exactly van helsing and i arrived at hillingham at eight oclock it was a lovely morning the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of natures annual work the leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours but had not yet begun to drop from the trees when we entered we met mrs westenra coming out of the morning room she is always an early riser she greeted us warmly and said ,Dracula
you will be glad to know that lucy is better the dear child is still asleep i looked into her room and saw her but did not go in lest i should disturb her the professor smiled and looked quite jubilant he rubbed his hands together and said ,Dracula
well i was anxious about the dear child in the night and went into her room she was sleeping soundlyso soundly that even my coming did not wake her but the room was awfully stuffy there were a lot of those horrible strongsmelling flowers about everywhere and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck i feared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dear child in her weak state so i took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air you will be pleased with her i am sure ,Dracula
she moved off into her boudoir where she usually breakfasted early as she had spoken i watched the professors face and saw it turn ashen grey he had been able to retain his selfcommand whilst the poor lady was present for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room but the instant she had disappeared he pulled me suddenly and forcibly into the diningroom and closed the door ,Dracula
then for the first time in my life i saw van helsing break down he raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair and then beat his palms together in a helpless way finally he sat down on a chair and putting his hands before his face began to sob with loud dry sobs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart then he raised his arms again as though appealing to the whole universe god god god he said what have we done what has this poor thing done that we are so sore beset is there fate amongst us still sent down from the pagan world of old that such things must be and in such way this poor mother all unknowing and all for the best as she think does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul and we must not tell her we must not even warn her or she die and then both die oh how we are beset how are all the powers of the devils against us suddenly he jumped to his feet come he said come we must see and act devils or no devils or all the devils at once it matters not we fight him all the same he went to the halldoor for his bag and together we went up to lucys room ,Dracula
once again i drew up the blind whilst van helsing went towards the bed this time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful waxen pallor as before he wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity ,Dracula
as i expected he murmured with that hissing inspiration of his which meant so much without a word he went and locked the door and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood i had long ago recognised the necessity and begun to take off my coat but he stopped me with a warning hand no he said today you must operate i shall provide you are weakened already as he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirtsleeve ,Dracula
presently he took an opportunity of telling mrs westenra that she must not remove anything from lucys room without consulting him that the flowers were of medicinal value and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure then he took over the care of the case himself saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come ,Dracula
 septemberfour days and nights of peace i am getting so strong again that i hardly know myself it is as if i had passed through some long nightmare and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me i have a dim halfremembrance of long anxious times of waiting and fearing darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant and then long spells of oblivion and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water since however dr van helsing has been with me all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away the noises that used to frighten me out of my witsthe flapping against the windows the distant voices which seemed so close to me the harsh sounds that came from i know not where and commanded me to do i know not whathave all ceased i go to bed now without any fear of sleep i do not even try to keep awake i have grown quite fond of the garlic and a boxful arrives for me every day from haarlem tonight dr van helsing is going away as he has to be for a day in amsterdam but i need not be watched i am well enough to be left alone thank god for mothers sake and dear arthurs and for all our friends who have been so kind i shall not even feel the change for last night dr van helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time i found him asleep twice when i awoke but i did not fear to go to sleep again although the boughs or bats or something napped almost angrily against the windowpanes ,Dracula
after many inquiries and almost as many refusals and perpetually using the words pall mall gazette as a sort of talisman i managed to find the keeper of the section of the zological gardens in which the wolf department is included thomas bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephanthouse and was just sitting down to his tea when i found him thomas and his wife are hospitable folk elderly and without children and if the specimen i enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind their lives must be pretty comfortable the keeper would not enter on what he called business until the supper was over and we were all satisfied then when the table was cleared and he had lit his pipe he said ,Dracula
now sir you can go on and arsk me what you want youll excoose me refoosin to talk of perfeshunal subjects afore meals i gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their tea afore i begins to arsk them questions ,Dracula
ittin of them over the ead with a pole is one way scratchin of their hears is another when gents as is flush wants a bit of a showorf to their gals i dont so much mind the fustthe ittin with a pole afore i chucks in their dinner but i waits till theyve ad their sherry and kawffee so to speak afore i tries on with the earscratchin mind you he added philosophically theres a deal of the same nature in us as in them theer animiles heres you acomin and arskin of me questions about my business and i that grumpylike that only for your bloomin arfquid id a seen you blowed fust fore id answer not even when you arsked me sarcasticlike if id like you to arsk the superintendent if you might arsk me questions without offence did i tell yer to go to ell ,Dracula
an when you said youd report me for usin of obscene language that was ittin me over the ead but the arfquid made that all right i werent agoin to fight so i waited for the food and did with my owl as the wolves and lions and tigers does but lor love yer art now that the old ooman has stuck a chunk of her teacake in me an rinsed me out with her bloomin old teapot and ive lit hup you may scratch my ears for all youre worth and wont git even a growl out of me drive along with your questions i know what yer acomin at that ere escaped wolf ,Dracula
exactly i want you to give me your view of it just tell me how it happened and when i know the facts ill get you to say what you consider was the cause of it and how you think the whole affair will end ,Dracula
all right guvnor this ere is about the ole story that ere wolf what we called bersicker was one of three grey ones that came from norway to jamrachs which we bought off him four years ago he was a nice wellbehaved wolf that never gave no trouble to talk of im more surprised at im for wantin to get out nor any other animile in the place but there you cant trust wolves no more nor women ,Dracula
well sir it was about two hours after feedin yesterday when i first hear my disturbance i was makin up a litter in the monkeyhouse for a young puma which is ill but when i heard the yelpin and owlin i kem away straight there was bersicker atearin like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out there wasnt much people about that day and close at hand was only one man a tall thin chap with a ook nose and a pointed beard with a few white hairs runnin through it he had a ard cold look and red eyes and i took a sort of mislike to him for it seemed as if it was im as they was hirritated at he ad white kid gloves on is ands and he pointed out the animiles to me and says keeper these wolves seem upset at something ,Dracula
maybe its you says i for i did not like the airs as he give isself he didnt git angry as i oped he would but he smiled a kind of insolent smile with a mouth full of white sharp teeth oh no they wouldnt like me e says ,Dracula
well it was a odd thing but when the animiles see us atalkin they lay down and when i went over to bersicker he let me stroke his ears same as ever that there man kem over and blessed but if he didnt put in his hand and stroke the old wolfs ears too ,Dracula
no says he not exactly in the business but i ave made pets of several and with that he lifts his at as perlite as a lord and walks away old bersicker kep alookin arter im till e was out of sight and then went and lay down in a corner and wouldnt come hout the ole hevening well larst night so soon as the moon was hup the wolves here all began aowling there warnt nothing for them to owl at there warnt no one near except some one that was evidently acallin a dog somewheres out back of the gardings in the park road once or twice i went out to see that all was right and it was and then the owling stopped just before twelve oclock i just took a look round afore turnin in an bust me but when i kem opposite to old bersickers cage i see the rails broken and twisted about and the cage empty and thats all i know for certing ,Dracula
one of our gardners was acomin ome about that time from a armony when he sees a big grey dog comin out through the garding edges at least so he says but i dont give much for it myself for if he did e never said a word about it to his missis when e got ome and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known and we had been up all nightahuntin of the park for bersicker that he remembered seein anything my own belief was that the armony ad got into his ead ,Dracula
from the hearty way that both thomas and his wife laughed at the joke i could see that it had done service before and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell i couldnt cope in badinage with the worthy thomas but i thought i knew a surer way to his heart so i said ,Dracula
my opinion is this that ere wolf is aidin of somewheres the gardner wot didnt remember said he was agallopin northward faster than a horse could go but i dont believe him for yer see sir wolves dont gallop no more nor dogs does they not bein built that way wolves is fine things in a storybook and i dessay when they gets in packs and does be chivyin somethin thats more afeared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up whatever it is but lor bless you in real life a wolf is only a low creature not half so clever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight in im this one aint been used to fightin or even to providin for hisself and more like hes somewhere round the park aidin an ashiverin of and if he thinks at all wonderin where he is to get his breakfast from or maybe hes got down some area and is in a coalcellar my eye wont some cook get a rum start when she sees his green eyes ashining at her out of the dark if he cant get food hes bound to look for it and mayhap he may chance to light on a butchers shop in time if he doesnt and some nursemaid goes awalkin orf with a soldier leavin of the hinfant in the perambulatorwell then i shouldnt be surprised if the census is one babby the less thats all ,Dracula
he went to the door and opened it a most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me i have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea ,Dracula
after all however there is nothing like custom for neither bilder nor his wife thought any more of the wolf than i should of a dog the animal itself was as peaceful and wellbehaved as that father of all picturewolvesred riding hoods quondam friend whilst moving her confidence in masquerade ,Dracula
the whole scene was an unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos the wicked wolf that for half a day had paralysed london and set all the children in the town shivering in their shoes was there in a sort of penitent mood and was received and petted like a sort of vulpine prodigal son old bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude and when he had finished with his penitent said ,Dracula
there i knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble didnt i say it all along heres his head all cut and full of broken glass es been agettin over some bloomin wall or other its a shyme that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles this eres what comes of it come along bersicker ,Dracula
 septemberi was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books which through press of other work and the many visits to lucy had fallen sadly into arrear suddenly the door was burst open and in rushed my patient with his face distorted with passion i was thunderstruck for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the superintendents study is almost unknown without an instants pause he made straight at me he had a dinnerknife in his hand and as i saw he was dangerous i tried to keep the table between us he was too quick and too strong for me however for before i could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely before he could strike again however i got in my right and he was sprawling on his back on the floor my wrist bled freely and quite a little pool trickled on to the carpet i saw that my friend was not intent on further effort and occupied myself binding up my wrist keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time when the attendants rushed in and we turned our attention to him his employment positively sickened me he was lying on his belly on the floor licking up like a dog the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist he was easily secured and to my surprise went with the attendants quite placidly simply repeating over and over again the blood is the life the blood is the life ,Dracula
i cannot afford to lose blood just at present i have lost too much of late for my physical good and then the prolonged strain of lucys illness and its horrible phases is telling on me i am overexcited and weary and i need rest rest rest happily van helsing has not summoned me so i need not forego my sleep tonight i could not well do without it ,Dracula
 septemberdo not fail to be at hillingham tonight if not watching all the time frequently visit and see that flowers are as placed very important do not fail shall be with you as soon as possible after arrival ,Dracula
 septemberjust off for train to london the arrival of van helsings telegram filled me with dismay a whole night lost and i know by bitter experience what may happen in a night of course it is possible that all may be well but what may have happened surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do i shall take this cylinder with me and then i can complete my entry on lucys phonograph ,Dracula
 september nighti write this and leave it to be seen so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me this is an exact record of what took place tonight i feel i am dying of weakness and have barely strength to write but it must be done if i die in the doing ,Dracula
i was waked by the flapping at the window which had begun after that sleepwalking on the cliff at whitby when mina saved me and which now i know so well i was not afraid but i did wish that dr seward was in the next roomas dr van helsing said he would beso that i might have called him i tried to go to sleep but could not then there came to me the old fear of sleep and i determined to keep awake perversely sleep would try to come then when i did not want it so as i feared to be alone i opened my door and called out is there anybody there there was no answer i was afraid to wake mother and so closed my door again then outside in the shrubbery i heard a sort of howl like a dogs but more fierce and deeper i went to the window and looked out but could see nothing except a big bat which had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window so i went back to bed again but determined not to go to sleep presently the door opened and mother looked in seeing by my moving that i was not asleep came in and sat by me she said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont ,Dracula
i feared she might catch cold sitting there and asked her to come in and sleep with me so she came into bed and lay down beside me she did not take off her dressing gown for she said she would only stay a while and then go back to her own bed as she lay there in my arms and i in hers the flapping and buffeting came to the window again she was startled and a little frightened and cried out what is that i tried to pacify her and at last succeeded and she lay quiet but i could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly after a while there was the low howl again out in the shrubbery and shortly after there was a crash at the window and a lot of broken glass was hurled on the floor the window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in and in the aperture of the broken panes there was the head of a great gaunt grey wolf mother cried out in a fright and struggled up into a sitting posture and clutched wildly at anything that would help her amongst other things she clutched the wreath of flowers that dr van helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck and tore it away from me for a second or two she sat up pointing at the wolf and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat then she fell overas if struck with lightning and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two the room and all round seemed to spin round i kept my eyes fixed on the window but the wolf drew his head back and a whole myriad of little specks seemed to come blowing in through the broken window and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a simoon in the desert i tried to stir but there was some spell upon me and dear mothers poor body which seemed to grow cold alreadyfor her dear heart had ceased to beatweighed me down and i remembered no more for a while ,Dracula
the time did not seem long but very very awful till i recovered consciousness again somewhere near a passing bell was tolling the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling and in our shrubbery seemingly just outside a nightingale was singing i was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother come back to comfort me the sounds seemed to have awakened the maids too for i could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door i called to them and they came in and when they saw what had happened and what it was that lay over me on the bed they screamed out the wind rushed in through the broken window and the door slammed to they lifted off the body of my dear mother and laid her covered up with a sheet on the bed after i had got up they were all so frightened and nervous that i directed them to go to the diningroom and have each a glass of wine the door flew open for an instant and closed again the maids shrieked and then went in a body to the diningroom and i laid what flowers i had on my dear mothers breast when they were there i remembered what dr van helsing had told me but i didnt like to remove them and besides i would have some of the servants to sit up with me now i was surprised that the maids did not come back i called them but got no answer so i went to the diningroom to look for them ,Dracula
my heart sank when i saw what had happened they all four lay helpless on the floor breathing heavily the decanter of sherry was on the table half full but there was a queer acrid smell about i was suspicious and examined the decanter it smelt of laudanum and looking on the sideboard i found that the bottle which mothers doctor uses for heroh did usewas empty what am i to do what am i to do i am back in the room with mother i cannot leave her and i am alone save for the sleeping servants whom some one has drugged alone with the dead i dare not go out for i can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window ,Dracula
the air seems full of specks floating and circling in the draught from the window and the lights burn blue and dim what am i to do god shield me from harm this night i shall hide this paper in my breast where they shall find it when they come to lay me out my dear mother gone it is time that i go too goodbye dear arthur if i should not survive this night god keep you dear and god help me ,Dracula
 septemberi drove at once to hillingham and arrived early keeping my cab at the gate i went up the avenue alone i knocked gently and rang as quietly as possible for i feared to disturb lucy or her mother and hoped to only bring a servant to the door after a while finding no response i knocked and rang again still no answer i cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie abed at such an hourfor it was now ten oclockand so rang and knocked again but more impatiently but still without response hitherto i had blamed only the servants but now a terrible fear began to assail me was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight around us was it indeed a house of death to which i had come too late i knew that minutes even seconds of delay might mean hours of danger to lucy if she had had again one of those frightful relapses and i went round the house to try if i could find by chance an entry anywhere ,Dracula
i could find no means of ingress every window and door was fastened and locked and i returned baffled to the porch as i did so i heard the rapid pitpat of a swiftly driven horses feet they stopped at the gate and a few seconds later i met van helsing running up the avenue when he saw me he gasped out ,Dracula
i answered as quickly and coherently as i could that i had only got his telegram early in the morning and had not lost a minute in coming here and that i could not make any one in the house hear me he paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly ,Dracula
we went round to the back of the house where there was a kitchen window the professor took a small surgical saw from his case and handing it to me pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window i attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them then with a long thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window i helped the professor in and followed him there was no one in the kitchen or in the servants rooms which were close at hand we tried all the rooms as we went along and in the diningroom dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters found four servantwomen lying on the floor there was no need to think them dead for their stertorous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition van helsing and i looked at each other and as we moved away he said we can attend to them later then we ascended to lucys room for an instant or two we paused at the door to listen but there was no sound that we could hear with white faces and trembling hands we opened the door gently and entered the room ,Dracula
how shall i describe what we saw on the bed lay two women lucy and her mother the latter lay farthest in and she was covered with a white sheet the edge of which had been blown back by the draught through the broken window showing the drawn white face with a look of terror fixed upon it by her side lay lucy with face white and still more drawn the flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mothers bosom and her throat was bare showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before but looking horribly white and mangled without a word the professor bent over the bed his head almost touching poor lucys breast then he gave a quick turn of his head as of one who listens and leaping to his feet he cried out to me ,Dracula
i flew downstairs and returned with it taking care to smell and taste it lest it too were drugged like the decanter of sherry which i found on the table the maids were still breathing but more restlessly and i fancied that the narcotic was wearing off i did not stay to make sure but returned to van helsing he rubbed the brandy as on another occasion on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands he said to me ,Dracula
i can do this all that can be at the present you go wake those maids flick them in the face with a wet towel and flick them hard make them get heat and fire and a warm bath this poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her she will need be heated before we can do anything more ,Dracula
i went at once and found little difficulty in waking three of the women the fourth was only a young girl and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly so i lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep the others were dazed at first but as remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner i was stern with them however and would not let them talk i told them that one life was bad enough to lose and that if they delayed they would sacrifice miss lucy so sobbing and crying they went about their way half clad as they were and prepared fire and water fortunately the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive and there was no lack of hot water we got a bath and carried lucy out as she was and placed her in it whilst we were busy chafing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door one of the maids ran off hurried on some more clothes and opened it then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from mr holmwood i bade her simply tell him that he must wait for we could see no one now she went away with the message and engrossed with our work i clean forgot all about him ,Dracula
i never saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadly earnest i knewas he knewthat it was a standup fight with death and in a pause told him so he answered me in a way that i did not understand but with the sternest look that his face could wear ,Dracula
presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect lucys heart beat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope and her lungs had a perceptible movement van helsings face almost beamed and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me ,Dracula
we took lucy into another room which had by now been prepared and laid her in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat i noticed that van helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat she was still unconscious and was quite as bad as if not worse than we had ever seen her ,Dracula
we must consult as to what is to be done he said as we descended the stairs in the hall he opened the diningroom door and we passed in he closing the door carefully behind him the shutters had been opened but the blinds were already down with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the british woman of the lower classes always rigidly observes the room was therefore dimly dark it was however light enough for our purposes van helsings sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity he was evidently torturing his mind about something so i waited for an instant and he spoke ,Dracula
what are we to do now where are we to turn for help we must have another transfusion of blood and that soon or that poor girls life wont be worth an hours purchase you are exhausted already i am exhausted too i fear to trust those women even if they would have courage to submit what are we to do for some one who will open his veins for her ,Dracula
the voice came from the sofa across the room and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart for they were those of quincey morris van helsing started angrily at the first sound but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as i cried out quincey morris and rushed towards him with outstretched hands ,Dracula
once again we went through that ghastly operation i have not the heart to go through with the details lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before for though plenty of blood went into her veins her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear however the action of both heart and lungs improved and van helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphia as before and with good effect her faint became a profound slumber the professor watched whilst i went downstairs with quincey morris and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cabmen who were waiting i left quincey lying down after having a glass of wine and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast then a thought struck me and i went back to the room where lucy now was when i came softly in i found van helsing with a sheet or two of notepaper in his hand he had evidently read it and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow there was a look of grim satisfaction in his face as of one who has had a doubt solved he handed me the paper saying only it dropped from lucys breast when we carried her to the bath ,Dracula
when i had read it i stood looking at the professor and after a pause asked him in gods name what does it all mean was she or is she mad or what sort of horrible danger is it i was so bewildered that i did not know what to say more van helsing put out his hand and took the paper saying ,Dracula
do not trouble about it now forget it for the present you shall know and understand it all in good time but it will be later and now what is it that you came to me to say this brought me back to fact and i was all myself again ,Dracula
i came to speak about the certificate of death if we do not act properly and wisely there may be an inquest and that paper would have to be produced i am in hopes that we need have no inquest for if we had it would surely kill poor lucy if nothing else did i know and you know and the other doctor who attended her knows that mrs westenra had disease of the heart and we can certify that she died of it let us fill up the certificate at once and i shall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker ,Dracula
good oh my friend john well thought of truly miss lucy if she be sad in the foes that beset her is at least happy in the friends that love her one two three all open their veins for her besides one old man ah yes i know friend john i am not blind i love you all the more for it now go ,Dracula
in the hall i met quincey morris with a telegram for arthur telling him that mrs westenra was dead that lucy also had been ill but was now going on better and that van helsing and i were with her i told him where i was going and he hurried me out but as i was going said ,Dracula
when you come back jack may i have two words with you all to ourselves i nodded in reply and went out i found no difficulty about the registration and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements ,Dracula
when i got back quincey was waiting for me i told him i would see him as soon as i knew about lucy and went up to her room she was still sleeping and the professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side from his putting his finger to his lips i gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature so i went down to quincey and took him into the breakfastroom where the blinds were not drawn down and which was a little more cheerful or rather less cheerless than the other rooms when we were alone he said to me ,Dracula
jack seward i dont want to shove myself in anywhere where ive no right to be but this is no ordinary case you know i loved that girl and wanted to marry her but although thats all past and gone i cant help feeling anxious about her all the same what is it thats wrong with her the dutchmanand a fine old fellow he is i can see thatsaid that time you two came into the room that you must have another transfusion of blood and that both you and he were exhausted now i know well that you medical men speak in camera and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private but this is no common matter and whatever it is i have done my part is not that so ,Dracula
and i guess art was in it too when i saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer i have not seen anything pulled down so quick since i was on the pampas and had a mare that i was fond of go to grass all in a night one of those big bats that they call vampires had got at her in the night and what with his gorge and the vein left open there wasnt enough blood in her to let her stand up and i had to put a bullet through her as she lay jack if you may tell me without betraying confidence arthur was the first is not that so as he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious he was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain his very heart was bleeding and it took all the manhood of himand there was a royal lot of it tooto keep him from breaking down i paused before answering for i felt that i must not betray anything which the professor wished kept secret but already he knew so much and guessed so much that there could be no reason for not answering so i answered in the same phrase thats so ,Dracula
ten days then i guess jack seward that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the blood of four strong men man alive her whole body wouldnt hold it then coming close to me he spoke in a fierce halfwhisper what took it out ,Dracula
i shook my head that i said is the crux van helsing is simply frantic about it and i am at my wits end i cant even hazard a guess there has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to lucy being properly watched but these shall not occur again here we stay until all be wellor ill quincey held out his hand count me in he said you and the dutchman will tell me what to do and ill do it ,Dracula
when she woke late in the afternoon lucys first movement was to feel in her breast and to my surprise produced the paper which van helsing had given me to read the careful professor had replaced it where it had come from lest on waking she should be alarmed her eye then lit on van helsing and on me too and gladdened then she looked around the room and seeing where she was shuddered she gave a loud cry and put her poor thin hands before her pale face we both understood what that meantthat she had realised to the full her mothers death so we tried what we could to comfort her doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat but she was very low in thought and spirit and wept silently and weakly for a long time we told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time and that seemed to comfort her towards dusk she fell into a doze here a very odd thing occurred whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two van helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her all the same however she went on with the action of tearing as though the material were still in her hands finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments van helsing seemed surprised and his brows gathered as if in thought but he said nothing ,Dracula
 septemberall last night she slept fitfully being always afraid to sleep and something weaker when she woke from it the professor and i took it in turns to watch and we never left her for a moment unattended quincey morris said nothing about his intention but i knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house ,Dracula
when the day came its searching light showed the ravages in poor lucys strength she was hardly able to turn her head and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good at times she slept and both van helsing and i noticed the difference in her between sleeping and waking whilst asleep she looked stronger although more haggard and her breathing was softer her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth which thus looked positively longer and sharper than usual when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression for she looked her own self although a dying one in the afternoon she asked for arthur and we telegraphed for him quincey went off to meet him at the station ,Dracula
when he arrived it was nearly six oclock and the sun was setting full and warm and the red light streamed in through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks when he saw her arthur was simply choking with emotion and none of us could speak in the hours that had passed the fits of sleep or the comatose condition that passed for it had grown more frequent so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened arthurs presence however seemed to act as a stimulant she rallied a little and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived he too pulled himself together and spoke as cheerily as he could so that the best was made of everything ,Dracula
it was now nearly one oclock and he and van helsing are sitting with her i am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour and i am entering this on lucys phonograph until six oclock they are to try to rest i fear that tomorrow will end our watching for the shock has been too great the poor child cannot rally god help us all ,Dracula
it seems an age since i heard from you or indeed since i wrote you will pardon me i know for all my faults when you have read all my budget of news well i got my husband back all right when we arrived at exeter there was a carriage waiting for us and in it though he had an attack of gout mr hawkins he took us to his house where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable and we dined together after dinner mr hawkins said ,Dracula
my dears i want to drink your health and prosperity and may every blessing attend you both i know you both from children and have with love and pride seen you grow up now i want you to make your home here with me i have left to me neither chick nor child all are gone and in my will i have left you everything i cried lucy dear as jonathan and the old man clasped hands our evening was a very very happy one ,Dracula
so here we are installed in this beautiful old house and from both my bedroom and the drawingroom i can see the great elms of the cathedral close with their great black stems standing out against the old yellow stone of the cathedral and i can hear the rooks overhead cawing and cawing and chattering and gossiping all day after the manner of rooksand humans i am busy i need not tell you arranging things and housekeeping jonathan and mr hawkins are busy all day for now that jonathan is a partner mr hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients ,Dracula
how is your dear mother getting on i wish i could run up to town for a day or two to see you dear but i dare not go yet with so much on my shoulders and jonathan wants looking after still he is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again but he was terribly weakened by the long illness even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until i can coax him back to his usual placidity however thank god these occasions grow less frequent as the days go on and they will in time pass away altogether i trust and now i have told you my news let me ask yours when are you to be married and where and who is to perform the ceremony and what are you to wear and is it to be a public or a private wedding tell me all about it dear tell me all about everything for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dear to me jonathan asks me to send his respectful duty but i do not think that is good enough from the junior partner of the important firm hawkins  harker and so as you love me and he loves me and i love you with all the moods and tenses of the verb i send you simply his love instead goodbye my dearest lucy and all blessings on you ,Dracula
in accordance with your wishes i enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge with regard to patient renfield there is more to say he has had another outbreak which might have had a dreadful ending but which as it fortunately happened was unattended with any unhappy results this afternoon a carriers cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on oursthe house to which you will remember the patient twice ran away the men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way as they were strangers i was myself looking out of the study window having a smoke after dinner and saw one of them come up to the house as he passed the window of renfields room the patient began to rate him from within and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to the man who seemed a decent fellow enough contented himself by telling him to shut up for a foulmouthed beggar whereon our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it i opened the window and signed to the man not to notice so he contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of a place he had got to by saying lor bless yer sir i wouldnt mind what was said to me in a bloomin madhouse i pity ye and the guvnor for havin to live in the house with a wild beast like that then he asked his way civilly enough and i told him where the gate of the empty house was he went away followed by threats and curses and revilings from our man i went down to see if i could make out any cause for his anger since he is usually such a wellbehaved man and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred i found him to my astonishment quite composed and most genial in his manner i tried to get him to talk of the incident but he blandly asked me questions as to what i meant and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair it was i am sorry to say however only another instance of his cunning for within half an hour i heard of him again this time he had broken out through the window of his room and was running down the avenue i called to the attendants to follow me and ran after him for i feared he was intent on some mischief my fear was justified when i saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road having on it some great wooden boxes the men were wiping their foreheads and were flushed in the face as if with violent exercise before i could get up to him the patient rushed at them and pulling one of them off the cart began to knock his head against the ground if i had not seized him just at the moment i believe he would have killed the man there and then the other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the buttend of his heavy whip it was a terrible blow but he did not seem to mind it but seized him also and struggled with the three of us pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens you know i am no light weight and the others were both burly men at first he was silent in his fighting but as we began to master him and the attendants were putting a straitwaistcoat on him he began to shout ill frustrate them they shant rob me they shant murder me by inches ill fight for my lord and master and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings it was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room one of the attendants hardy had a finger broken however i set it all right and he is going on well ,Dracula
the two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us their threats were however mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman they said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him they gave as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state of drouth to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labours of any place of public entertainment i quite understood their drift and after a stiff glass of grog or rather more of the same and with each a sovereign in hand they made light of the attack and swore that they would encounter a worse madman any day for the pleasure of meeting so bloomin good a bloke as your correspondent i took their names and addresses in case they might be needed they are as followsjack smollet of duddings rents king georges road great walworth and thomas snelling peter farleys row guide court bethnal green they are both in the employment of harris  sons moving and shipment company orange masters yard soho ,Dracula
such a sad blow has befallen us mr hawkins has died very suddenly some may not think it so sad for us but we had both come to so love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father i never knew either father or mother so that the dear old mans death is a real blow to me jonathan is greatly distressed it is not only that he feels sorrow deep sorrow for the dear good man who has befriended him all his life and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice but jonathan feels it on another account he says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous he begins to doubt himself i try to cheer him up and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself but it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most oh it is too hard that a sweet simple noble strong nature such as hisa nature which enabled him by our dear good friends aid to rise from clerk to master in a few yearsshould be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone forgive me dear if i worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness but lucy dear i must tell some one for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to jonathan tries me and i have no one here that i can confide in i dread coming up to london as we must do the day after tomorrow for poor mr hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father as there are no relations at all jonathan will have to be chief mourner i shall try to run over to see you dearest if only for a few minutes forgive me for troubling you with all blessings ,Dracula
 septemberonly resolution and habit can let me make an entry tonight i am too miserable too lowspirited too sick of the world and all in it including life itself that i would not care if i heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death and he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of latelucys mother and arthurs father and now let me get on with my work ,Dracula
i duly relieved van helsing in his watch over lucy we wanted arthur to go to rest also but he refused at first it was only when i told him that we should want him to help us during the day and that we must not all break down for want of rest lest lucy should suffer that he agreed to go van helsing was very kind to him come my child he said come with me you are sick and weak and have had much sorrow and much mental pain as well as that tax on your strength that we know of you must not be alone for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms come to the drawingroom where there is a big fire and there are two sofas you shall lie on one and i on the other and our sympathy will be comfort to each other even though we do not speak and even if we sleep arthur went off with him casting back a longing look on lucys face which lay in her pillow almost whiter than the lawn she lay quite still and i looked round the room to see that all was as it should be i could see that the professor had carried out in this room as in the other his purpose of using the garlic the whole of the windowsashes reeked with it and round lucys neck over the silk handkerchief which van helsing made her keep on was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers lucy was breathing somewhat stertorously and her face was at its worst for the open mouth showed the pale gums her teeth in the dim uncertain light seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning in particular by some trick of the light the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest i sat down by her and presently she moved uneasily at the same moment there came a sort of dull flapping or buffeting at the window i went over to it softly and peeped out by the corner of the blind there was a full moonlight and i could see that the noise was made by a great bat which wheeled rounddoubtless attracted by the light although so dimand every now and again struck the window with its wings when i came back to my seat i found that lucy had moved slightly and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat i replaced them as well as i could and sat watching her ,Dracula
presently she woke and i gave her food as van helsing had prescribed she took but a little and that languidly there did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness it struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her it was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state with the stertorous breathing she put the flowers from her but that when she waked she clutched them close there was no possibility of making any mistake about this for in the long hours that followed she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times ,Dracula
at six oclock van helsing came to relieve me arthur had then fallen into a doze and he mercifully let him sleep on when he saw lucys face i could hear the sissing indraw of his breath and he said to me in a sharp whisper draw up the blind i want light then he bent down and with his face almost touching lucys examined her carefully he removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat as he did so he started back and i could hear his ejaculation mein gott as it was smothered in his throat i bent over and looked too and as i noticed some queer chill came over me ,Dracula
i went to the diningroom and waked him he was dazed for a moment but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutters he thought he was late and expressed his fear i assured him that lucy was still asleep but told him as gently as i could that both van helsing and i feared that the end was near he covered his face with his hands and slid down on his knees by the sofa where he remained perhaps a minute with his head buried praying whilst his shoulders shook with grief i took him by the hand and raised him up come i said my dear old fellow summon all your fortitude it will be best and easiest for her ,Dracula
when we came into lucys room i could see that van helsing had with his usual forethought been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible he had even brushed lucys hair so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples when we came into the room she opened her eyes and seeing him whispered softly ,Dracula
so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and she looked her best with all the soft lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes then gradually her eyes closed and she sank to sleep for a little bit her breast heaved softly and her breath came and went like a tired childs ,Dracula
and then insensibly there came the strange change which i had noticed in the night her breathing grew stertorous the mouth opened and the pale gums drawn back made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever in a sort of sleepwaking vague unconscious way she opened her eyes which were now dull and hard at once and said in a soft voluptuous voice such as i had never heard from her lips ,Dracula
arthur oh my love i am so glad you have come kiss me arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her but at that instant van helsing who like me had been startled by her voice swooped upon him and catching him by the neck with both hands dragged him back with a fury of strength which i never thought he could have possessed and actually hurled him almost across the room ,Dracula
very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness and putting out her poor pale thin hand took van helsings great brown one drawing it to her she kissed it my true friend she said in a faint voice but with untellable pathos my true friend and his oh guard him and give me peace ,Dracula
i swear it he said solemnly kneeling beside her and holding up his hand as one who registers an oath then he turned to arthur and said to him come my child take her hand in yours and kiss her on the forehead and only once ,Dracula
i went back to the room and found van helsing looking at poor lucy and his face was sterner than ever some change had come over her body death had given back part of her beauty for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of their flowing lines even the lips had lost their deadly pallor it was as if the blood no longer needed for the working of the heart had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be ,Dracula
the funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day so that lucy and her mother might be buried together i attended to all the ghastly formalities and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff were afflictedor blessedwith something of his own obsequious suavity even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked to me in a confidential brotherprofessional way when she had come out from the deathchamber ,Dracula
i noticed that van helsing never kept far away this was possible from the disordered state of things in the household there were no relatives at hand and as arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his fathers funeral we were unable to notify any one who should have been bidden under the circumstances van helsing and i took it upon ourselves to examine papers etc he insisted upon looking over lucys papers himself i asked him why for i feared that he being a foreigner might not be quite aware of english legal requirements and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble he answered me ,Dracula
i know i know you forget that i am a lawyer as well as a doctor but this is not altogether for the law you knew that when you avoided the coroner i have more than him to avoid there may be papers moresuch as this ,Dracula
when you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late mrs westenra seal all her papers and write him tonight for me i watch here in the room and in miss lucys old room all night and i myself search for what may be it is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers ,Dracula
i went on with my part of the work and in another half hour had found the name and address of mrs westenras solicitor and had written to him all the poor ladys papers were in order explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given i had hardly sealed the letter when to my surprise van helsing walked into the room saying ,Dracula
i did not look for any specific thing i only hoped to find and find i have all that there wasonly some letters and a few memoranda and a diary new begun but i have them here and we shall for the present say nothing of them i shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening and with his sanction i shall use some ,Dracula
before turning in we went to look at poor lucy the undertaker had certainly done his work well for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente there was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers and death was made as little repulsive as might be the end of the windingsheet was laid over the face when the professor bent over and turned it gently back we both started at the beauty before us the tall wax candles showing a sufficient light to note it well all lucys loveliness had come back to her in death and the hours that had passed instead of leaving traces of decays effacing fingers had but restored the beauty of life till positively i could not believe my eyes that i was looking at a corpse ,Dracula
the professor looked sternly grave he had not loved her as i had and there was no need for tears in his eyes he said to me remain till i return and left the room he came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall but which had not been opened and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bed then he took from his neck inside his collar a little gold crucifix and placed it over the mouth he restored the sheet to its place and we came away ,Dracula
yes and no i want to operate but not as you think let me tell you now but not a word to another i want to cut off her head and take out her heart ah you a surgeon and so shocked you whom i have seen with no tremble of hand or heart do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder oh but i must not forget my dear friend john that you loved her and i have not forgotten it for it is i that shall operate and you must only help i would like to do it tonight but for arthur i must not he will be free after his fathers funeral tomorrow and he will want to see herto see it then when she is coffined ready for the next day you and i shall come when all sleep we shall unscrew the coffinlid and shall do our operation and then replace all so that none know save we alone ,Dracula
but why do it at all the girl is dead why mutilate her poor body without need and if there is no necessity for a postmortem and nothing to gain by itno good to her to us to science to human knowledgewhy do it without such it is monstrous ,Dracula
friend john i pity your poor bleeding heart and i love you the more because it does so bleed if i could i would take on myself the burden that you do bear but there are things that you know not but that you shall know and bless me for knowing though they are not pleasant things john my child you have been my friend now many years and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause i may erri am but man but i believe in all i do was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came yes were you not amazed nay horrified when i would not let arthur kiss his lovethough she was dyingand snatched him away by all my strength yes and yet you saw how she thanked me with her so beautiful dying eyes her voice too so weak and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me yes and did you not hear me swear promise to her that so she closed her eyes grateful yes ,Dracula
well i have good reason now for all i want to do you have for many years trust me you have believe me weeks past when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt believe me yet a little friend john if you trust me not then i must tell what i think and that is not perhaps well and if i workas work i shall no matter trust or no trustwithout my friend trust in me i work with heavy heart and feel oh so lonely when i want all help and courage that may be he paused a moment and went on solemnly friend john there are strange and terrible days before us let us not be two but one that so we work to a good end will you not have faith in me ,Dracula
i took his hand and promised him i held my door open as he went away and watched him go into his room and close the door as i stood without moving i saw one of the maids pass silently along the passageshe had her back towards me so did not see meand go into the room where lucy lay the sight touched me devotion is so rare and we are so grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest ,Dracula
because i get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it from the woman who robbed the dead and the living her punishment will surely come but not through me she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing she only stole now we must wait ,Dracula
the forenoon was a dreary time but at noon the solicitor came mr marquand of wholeman sons marquand  lidderdale he was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done and took off our hands all cares as to details during lunch he told us that mrs westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart and had put her affairs in absolute order he informed us that with the exception of a certain entailed property of lucys fathers which now in default of direct issue went back to a distant branch of the family the whole estate real and personal was left absolutely to arthur holmwood when he had told us so much he went on ,Dracula
frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance indeed we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes of course we had then no alternative but to accept we were right in principle and ninetynine times out of a hundred we should have proved by the logic of events the accuracy of our judgment frankly however i must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes for by her predeceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property and even had she only survived her mother by five minutes her property would in case there were no willand a will was a practical impossibility in such a casehave been treated at her decease as under intestacy in which case lord godalming though so dear a friend would have had no claim in the world and the inheritors being remote would not be likely to abandon their just rights for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger i assure you my dear sirs i am rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoiced ,Dracula
he did not remain long but said he would look in later in the day and see lord godalming his coming however had been a certain comfort to us since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts arthur was expected at five oclock so a little before that time we visited the deathchamber it was so in very truth for now both mother and daughter lay in it the undertaker true to his craft had made the best display he could of his goods and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once van helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to explaining that as lord godalming was coming very soon it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiance quite alone the undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before so that when arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved ,Dracula
poor fellow he looked desperately sad and broken even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his muchtried emotions he had i knew been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father and to lose him and at such a time was a bitter blow to him with me he was warm as ever and to van helsing he was sweetly courteous but i could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him the professor noticed it too and motioned me to bring him upstairs i did so and left him at the door of the room as i felt he would like to be quite alone with her but he took my arm and led me in saying huskily ,Dracula
i comforted him as well as i could in such cases men do not need much expression a grip of the hand the tightening of an arm over the shoulder a sob in unison are expressions of sympathy dear to a mans heart i stood still and silent till his sobs died away and then i said softly to him ,Dracula
together we moved over to the bed and i lifted the lawn from her face god how beautiful she was every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness it frightened and amazed me somewhat and as for arthur he fell atrembling and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague at last after a long pause he said to me in a faint whisper ,Dracula
i assured him sadly that it was so and went on to suggestfor i felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than i could helpthat it often happened that after death faces became softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering it seemed to quite do away with any doubt and after kneeling beside the couch for a while and looking at her lovingly and long he turned aside i told him that that must be goodbye as the coffin had to be prepared so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it and bent over and kissed her forehead he came away fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came ,Dracula
i left him in the drawingroom and told van helsing that he had said goodbye so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertakers men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin when he came out of the room again i told him of arthurs question and he replied ,Dracula
call me what you will he said i hope i may always have the title of a friend and let me say that i am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear he paused a moment and went on i know that she understood your goodness even better than i do and if i was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted soyou rememberthe professor noddedyou must forgive me ,Dracula
i know it was hard for you to quite trust me then for to trust such violence needs to understand and i take it that you do notthat you cannottrust me now for you do not yet understand and there may be more times when i shall want you to trust when you cannotand may notand must not yet understand but the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake and for the sake of others and for her dear sake to whom i swore to protect ,Dracula
and as it is all yours you have a right to deal with it as you will i want you to give me permission to read all miss lucys papers and letters believe me it is no idle curiosity i have a motive of which be sure she would have approved i have them all here i took them before we knew that all was yours so that no strange hand might touch themno strange eye look through words into her soul i shall keep them if i may even you may not see them yet but i shall keep them safe no word shall be lost and in the good time i shall give them back to you its a hard thing i ask but you will do it will you not for lucys sake ,Dracula
and you are right there will be pain for us all but it will not be all pain nor will this pain be the last we and you tooyou most of all my dear boywill have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet but we must be brave of heart and unselfish and do our duty and all will be well ,Dracula
i slept on a sofa in arthurs room that night van helsing did not go to bed at all he went to and fro as if patrolling the house and was never out of sight of the room where lucy lay in her coffin strewn with the wild garlic flowers which sent through the odour of lily and rose a heavy overpowering smell into the night ,Dracula
it seems only yesterday that the last entry was made and yet how much between then in whitby and all the world before me jonathan away and no news of him and now married to jonathan jonathan a solicitor a partner rich master of his business mr hawkins dead and buried and jonathan with another attack that may harm him some day he may ask me about it down it all goes i am rusty in my shorthandsee what unexpected prosperity does for usso it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow ,Dracula
the service was very simple and very solemn there were only ourselves and the servants there one or two old friends of his from exeter his london agent and a gentleman representing sir john paxton the president of the incorporated law society jonathan and i stood hand in hand and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us ,Dracula
we came back to town quietly taking a bus to hyde park corner jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the row for a while so we sat down but there were very few people there and it was sadlooking and desolate to see so many empty chairs it made us think of the empty chair at home so we got up and walked down piccadilly jonathan was holding me by the arm the way he used to in old days before i went to school i felt it very improper for you cant go on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit but it was jonathan and he was my husband and we didnt know anybody who saw usand we didnt care if they didso on we walked i was looking at a very beautiful girl in a big cartwheel hat sitting in a victoria outside guilianos when i felt jonathan clutch my arm so tight that he hurt me and he said under his breath my god i am always anxious about jonathan for i fear that some nervous fit may upset him again so i turned to him quickly and asked him what it was that disturbed him ,Dracula
he was very pale and his eyes seemed bulging out as half in terror and half in amazement he gazed at a tall thin man with a beaky nose and black moustache and pointed beard who was also observing the pretty girl he was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us and so i had a good view of him his face was not a good face it was hard and cruel and sensual and his big white teeth that looked all the whiter because his lips were so red were pointed like an animals jonathan kept staring at him till i was afraid he would notice i feared he might take it ill he looked so fierce and nasty i asked jonathan why he was disturbed and he answered evidently thinking that i knew as much about it as he did do you see who it is ,Dracula
the poor dear was evidently terrified at somethingvery greatly terrified i do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down he kept staring a man came out of the shop with a small parcel and gave it to the lady who then drove off the dark man kept his eyes fixed on her and when the carriage moved up piccadilly he followed in the same direction and hailed a hansom jonathan kept looking after him and said as if to himself ,Dracula
i believe it is the count but he has grown young my god if this be so oh my god my god if i only knew if i only knew he was distressing himself so much that i feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions so i remained silent i drew him away quietly and he holding my arm came easily we walked a little further and then went in and sat for a while in the green park it was a hot day for autumn and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place after a few minutes staring at nothing jonathans eyes closed and he went quietly into a sleep with his head on my shoulder i thought it was the best thing for him so did not disturb him in about twenty minutes he woke up and said to me quite cheerfully ,Dracula
why mina have i been asleep oh do forgive me for being so rude come and well have a cup of tea somewhere he had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of i dont like this lapsing into forgetfulness it may make or continue some injury to the brain i must not ask him for fear i shall do more harm than good but i must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad the time is come i fear when i must open that parcel and know what is written oh jonathan you will i know forgive me if i do wrong but it is for your own dear sake ,Dracula
latera sad homecoming in every waythe house empty of the dear soul who was so good to us jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady and now a telegram from van helsing whoever he may be ,Dracula
oh what a wealth of sorrow in a few words poor mrs westenra poor lucy gone gone never to return to us and poor poor arthur to have lost such sweetness out of his life god help us all to bear our troubles ,Dracula
 septemberit is all over arthur has gone back to ring and has taken quincey morris with him what a fine fellow is quincey i believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about lucys death as any of us but he bore himself through it like a moral viking if america can go on breeding men like that she will be a power in the world indeed van helsing is lying down having a rest preparatory to his journey he goes over to amsterdam tonight but says he returns tomorrow night that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally he is to stop with me then if he can he says he has work to do in london which may take him some time poor old fellow i fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength all the time of the burial he was i could see putting some terrible restraint on himself when it was all over we were standing beside arthur who poor fellow was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his lucys veins i could see van helsings face grow white and purple by turns arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of god none of us said a word of the other operations and none of us ever shall arthur and quincey went away together to the station and van helsing and i came on here the moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics he has denied to me since that it was hysterics and insisted that it was only his sense of humour asserting itself under very terrible conditions he laughed till he cried and i had to draw down the blinds lest any one should see us and misjudge and then he cried till he laughed again and laughed and cried together just as a woman does i tried to be stern with him as one is to a woman under the circumstances but it had no effect men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness then when his face grew grave and stern again i asked him why his mirth and why at such a time his reply was in a way characteristic of him for it was logical and forceful and mysterious he said ,Dracula
ah you dont comprehend friend john do not think that i am not sad though i laugh see i have cried even when the laugh did choke me but no more think that i am all sorry when i cry for the laugh he come just the same keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say may i come in is not the true laughter no he is a king and he come when and how he like he ask no person he choose no time of suitability he say i am here behold in example i grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl i give my blood for her though i am old and worn i give my time my skill my sleep i let my other sufferers want that so she may have all and yet i can laugh at her very gravelaugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say thud thud to my heart till it send back the blood from my cheek my heart bleed for that poor boythat dear boy so of the age of mine own boy had i been so blessed that he live and with his hair and eyes the same there you know now why i love him so and yet when he say things that touch my husbandheart to the quick and make my fatherheart yearn to him as to no other mannot even to you friend john for we are more level in experiences than father and sonyet even at such moment king laugh he come to me and shout and bellow in my ear here i am here i am till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek oh friend john it is a strange world a sad world a world full of miseries and woes and troubles and yet when king laugh come he make them all dance to the tune he play bleeding hearts and dry bones of the churchyard and tears that burn as they fallall dance together to the music that he make with that smileless mouth of him and believe me friend john that he is good to come and kind ah we men and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways then tears come and like the rain on the ropes they brace us up until perhaps the strain become too great and we break but king laugh he come like the sunshine and he ease off the strain again and we bear to go on with our labour what it may be ,Dracula
i did not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea but as i did not yet understand the cause of his laughter i asked him as he answered me his face grew stern and he said in quite a different tone ,Dracula
oh it was the grim irony of it allthis so lovely lady garlanded with flowers that looked so fair as life till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard where rest so many of her kin laid there with the mother who loved her and whom she loved and that sacred bell going toll toll toll so sad and slow and those holy men with the white garments of the angel pretending to read books and yet all the time their eyes never on the page and all of us with the bowed head and all for what she is dead so is it not ,Dracula
well for the life of me professor i said i cant see anything to laugh at in all that why your explanation makes it a harder puzzle than before but even if the burial service was comic what about poor art and his trouble why his heart was simply breaking ,Dracula
quite so but there was a difficulty friend john if so that then what about the others ho ho then this so sweet maid is a polyandrist and me with my poor wife dead to me but alive by churchs law though no wits all goneeven i who am faithful husband to this nownowife am bigamist ,Dracula
friend john forgive me if i pain i showed not my feeling to others when it would wound but only to you my old friend whom i can trust if you could have looked into my very heart then when i want to laugh if you could have done so when the laugh arrived if you could do so now when king laugh have pack up his crown and all that is to himfor he go far far away from me and for a long long timemaybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all ,Dracula
and now we are all scattered and for many a long day loneliness will sit over our roofs with brooding wings lucy lies in the tomb of her kin a lordly deathhouse in a lonely churchyard away from teeming london where the air is fresh and the sun rises over hampstead hill and where wild flowers grow of their own accord ,Dracula
so i can finish this diary and god only knows if i shall ever begin another if i do or if i even open this again it will be to deal with different people and different themes for here at the end where the romance of my life is told ere i go back to take up the thread of my lifework i say sadly and without hope ,Dracula
the neighbourhood of hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as the kensington horror or the stabbing woman or the woman in black during the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the heath in all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a bloofer lady it has always been late in the evening when they have been missed and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning it is generally supposed in the neighbourhood that as the first child missed gave as his reason for being away that a bloofer lady had asked him to come for a walk the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served this is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is luring each other away by wiles a correspondent writes us that to see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the bloofer lady is supremely funny some of our caricaturists might he says take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture it is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the bloofer lady should be the popular rle at these al fresco performances our correspondent navely says that even ellen terry could not be so winningly attractive as some of these grubbyfaced little children pretendand even imagine themselvesto be ,Dracula
there is however possibly a serious side to the question for some of the children indeed all who have been missed at night have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat the wounds seem such as might be made by a rat or a small dog and although of not much importance individually would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own the police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children especially when very young in and around hampstead heath and for any stray dog which may be about ,Dracula
we have just received intelligence that another child missed last night was only discovered late in the morning under a furze bush at the shooters hill side of hampstead heath which is perhaps less frequented than the other parts it has the same tiny wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases it was terribly weak and looked quite emaciated it too when partially restored had the common story to tell of being lured away by the bloofer lady ,Dracula
 septemberjonathan is better after a bad night i am so glad that he has plenty of work to do for that keeps his mind off the terrible things and oh i am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position i knew he would be true to himself and now how proud i am to see my jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him he will be away all day till late for he said he could not lunch at home my household work is done so i shall take his foreign journal and lock myself up in my room and read it ,Dracula
 septemberi hadnt the heart to write last night that terrible record of jonathans upset me so poor dear how he must have suffered whether it be true or only imagination i wonder if there is any truth in it at all did he get his brain fever and then write all those terrible things or had he some cause for it all i suppose i shall never know for i dare not open the subject to him and yet that man we saw yesterday he seemed quite certain of him poor fellow i suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought he believes it all himself i remember how on our weddingday he said unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake mad or sane there seems to be through it all some thread of continuity that fearful count was coming to london if it should be and he came to london with his teeming millions there may be a solemn duty and if it come we must not shrink from it i shall be prepared i shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing then we shall be ready for other eyes if required and if it be wanted then perhaps if i am ready poor jonathan may not be upset for i can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all if ever jonathan quite gets over the nervousness he may want to tell me of it all and i can ask him questions and find out things and see how i may comfort him ,Dracula
i pray you to pardon my writing in that i am so far friend as that i sent to you sad news of miss lucy westenras death by the kindness of lord godalming i am empowered to read her letters and papers for i am deeply concerned about certain matters vitally important in them i find some letters from you which show how great friends you were and how you love her oh madam mina by that love i implore you help me it is for others good that i askto redress great wrong and to lift much and terrible troublesthat may be more great than you can know may it be that i see you you can trust me i am friend of dr john seward and of lord godalming that was arthur of miss lucy i must keep it private for the present from all i should come to exeter to see you at once if you tell me i am privilege to come and where and when i implore your pardon madam i have read your letters to poor lucy and know how good you are and how your husband suffer so i pray you if it may be enlighten him not lest it may harm again your pardon and forgive me ,Dracula
 septemberi cannot help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visit of dr van helsing for somehow i expect that it will throw some light upon jonathans sad experience and as he attended poor dear lucy in her last illness he can tell me all about her that is the reason of his coming it is concerning lucy and her sleepwalking and not about jonathan then i shall never know the real truth now how silly i am that awful journal gets hold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour of course it is about lucy that habit came back to the poor dear and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill i had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards she must have told him of her sleepwalking adventure on the cliff and that i knew all about it and now he wants me to tell him what she knows so that he may understand i hope i did right in not saying anything of it to mrs westenra i should never forgive myself if any act of mine were it even a negative one brought harm on poor dear lucy i hope too dr van helsing will not blame me i have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that i feel i cannot bear more just at present ,Dracula
i suppose a cry does us all good at timesclears the air as other rain does perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me and then jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night the first time we have been parted since our marriage i do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself and that nothing will occur to upset him it is two oclock and the doctor will be here soon now i shall say nothing of jonathans journal unless he asks me i am so glad i have typewritten out my own journal so that in case he asks about lucy i can hand it to him it will save much questioning ,Dracula
laterhe has come and gone oh what a strange meeting and how it all makes my head whirl round i feel like one in a dream can it be all possible or even a part of it if i had not read jonathans journal first i should never have accepted even a possibility poor poor dear jonathan how he must have suffered please the good god all this may not upset him again i shall try to save him from it but it may be even a consolation and a help to himterrible though it be and awful in its consequencesto know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him and that it is all true it may be that it is the doubt which haunts him that when the doubt is removed no matter whichwaking or dreamingmay prove the truth he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock dr van helsing must be a good man as well as a clever one if he is arthurs friend and dr sewards and if they brought him all the way from holland to look after lucy i feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature when he comes tomorrow i shall ask him about jonathan and then please god all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end i used to think i would like to practise interviewing jonathans friend on the exeter news told him that memory was everything in such workthat you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken even if you had to refine some of it afterwards here was a rare interview i shall try to record it verbatim ,Dracula
i rose and bowed and he came towards me a man of medium weight strongly built with his shoulders set back over a broad deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck the poise of the head strikes one at once as indicative of thought and power the head is noble wellsized broad and large behind the ears the face cleanshaven shows a hard square chin a large resolute mobile mouth a goodsized nose rather straight but with quick sensitive nostrils that seem to broaden as the big bushy brows come down and the mouth tightens the forehead is broad and fine rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart such a forehead that the reddish hair cannot possibly tumble over it but falls naturally back and to the sides big dark blue eyes are set widely apart and are quick and tender or stern with the mans moods he said to me ,Dracula
oh madam mina i knew that the friend of that poor lily girl must be good but i had yet to learn he finished his speech with a courtly bow i asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about so he at once began ,Dracula
i have read your letters to miss lucy forgive me but i had to begin to inquire somewhere and there was none to ask i know that you were with her at whitby she sometimes kept a diaryyou need not look surprised madam mina it was begun after you had left and was in imitation of youand in that diary she traces by inference certain things to a sleepwalking in which she puts down that you saved her in great perplexity then i come to you and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember ,Dracula
oh madam mina i will be grateful you will do me much favour i could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a biti suppose it is some of the taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouthsso i handed him the shorthand diary he took it with a grateful bow and said ,Dracula
oh you so clever woman he said i knew long that mr jonathan was a man of much thankfulness but see his wife have all the good things and will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me alas i know not the shorthand by this time my little joke was over and i was almost ashamed so i took the typewritten copy from my workbasket and handed it to him ,Dracula
forgive me i said i could not help it but i had been thinking that it was of dear lucy that you wished to ask and so that you might not have time to waitnot on my account but because i know your time must be preciousi have written it out on the typewriter for you ,Dracula
by all means i said read it over whilst i order lunch and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat he bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light and became absorbed in the papers whilst i went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed when i came back i found him walking hurriedly up and down the room his face all ablaze with excitement he rushed up to me and took me by both hands ,Dracula
oh madam mina he said how can i say what i owe to you this paper is as sunshine it opens the gate to me i am daze i am dazzle with so much light and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time but that you do not cannot comprehend oh but i am grateful to you you so clever woman madamhe said this very solemnlyif ever abraham van helsing can do anything for you or yours i trust you will let me know it will be pleasure and delight if i may serve you as a friend as a friend but all i have ever learned all i can ever do shall be for you and those you love there are darknesses in life and there are lights you are one of the lights you will have happy life and good life and your husband will be blessed in you ,Dracula
not know youi who am old and who have studied all my life men and women i who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him and i have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me and which breathes out truth in every line i who have read your so sweet letter to poor lucy of your marriage and your trust not know you oh madam mina good women tell all their lives and by day and by hour and by minute such things that angels can read and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels eyes your husband is noble nature and you are noble too for you trust and trust cannot be where there is mean nature and your husbandtell me of him is he quite well is all that fever gone and is he strong and hearty i saw here an opening to ask him about jonathan so i said ,Dracula
he thought he saw some one who recalled something terrible something which led to his brain fever and here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush the pity for jonathan the horror which he experienced the whole fearful mystery of his diary and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since all came in a tumult i suppose i was hysterical for i threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him and implored him to make my husband well again he took my hands and raised me up and made me sit on the sofa and sat by me he held my hand in his and said to me with oh such infinite sweetness ,Dracula
my life is a barren and lonely one and so full of work that i have not had much time for friendships but since i have been summoned to here by my friend john seward i have known so many good people and seen such nobility that i feel more than everand it has grown with my advancing yearsthe loneliness of my life believe me then that i come here full of respect for you and you have given me hopehope not in what i am seeking of but that there are good women still left to make life happygood women whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be i am glad glad that i may here be of some use to you for if your husband suffer he suffer within the range of my study and experience i promise you that i will gladly do all for him that i canall to make his life strong and manly and your life a happy one now you must eat you are overwrought and perhaps overanxious husband jonathan would not like to see you so pale and what he like not where he love is not to his good therefore for his sake you must eat and smile you have told me all about lucy and so now we shall not speak of it lest it distress i shall stay in exeter tonight for i want to think much over what you have told me and when i have thought i will ask you questions if i may and then too you will tell me of husband jonathans trouble so far as you can but not yet you must eat now afterwards you shall tell me all ,Dracula
and now tell me all about him when it came to speaking to this great learned man i began to fear that he would think me a weak fool and jonathan a madmanthat journal is all so strangeand i hesitated to go on but he was so sweet and kind and he had promised to help and i trusted him so i said ,Dracula
dr van helsing what i have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband i have been since yesterday in a sort of fever of doubt you must be kind to me and not think me foolish that i have even half believed some very strange things he reassured me by his manner as well as his words when he said ,Dracula
oh my dear if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which i am here it is you who would laugh i have learned not to think little of any ones belief no matter how strange it be i have tried to keep an open mind and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it but the strange things the extraordinary things the things that make one doubt if they be mad or sane ,Dracula
thank you thank you a thousand times you have taken a weight off my mind if you will let me i shall give you a paper to read it is long but i have typewritten it out it will tell you my trouble and jonathans it is the copy of his journal when abroad and all that happened i dare not say anything of it you will read for yourself and judge and then when i see you perhaps you will be very kind and tell me what you think ,Dracula
jonathan will be here at halfpast eleven and you must come to lunch with us and see him then you could catch the quick  train which will leave you at paddington before eight he was surprised at my knowledge of the trains offhand but he does not know that i have made up all the trains to and from exeter so that i may help jonathan in case he is in a hurry ,Dracula
i have read your husbands so wonderful diary you may sleep without doubt strange and terrible as it is it is true i will pledge my life on it it may be worse for others but for him and you there is no dread he is a noble fellow and let me tell you from experience of men that one who would do as he did in going down that wall and to that roomay and going a second timeis not one to be injured in permanence by a shock his brain and his heart are all right this i swear before i have even seen him so be at rest i shall have much to ask him of other things i am blessed that today i come to see you for i have learn all at once so much that again i am dazzledazzle more than ever and i must think ,Dracula
a thousand thanks for your kind letter which has taken a great weight off my mind and yet if it be true what terrible things there are in the world and what an awful thing if that man that monster be really in london i fear to think i have this moment whilst writing had a wire from jonathan saying that he leaves by the  tonight from launceston and will be here at  so that i shall have no fear tonight will you therefore instead of lunching with us please come to breakfast at eight oclock if this be not too early for you you can get away if you are in a hurry by the  train which will bring you to paddington by  do not answer this as i shall take it that if i do not hear you will come to breakfast ,Dracula
 septemberi thought never to write in this diary again but the time has come when i got home last night mina had supper ready and when we had supped she told me of van helsings visit and of her having given him the two diaries copied out and of how anxious she has been about me she showed me in the doctors letter that all i wrote down was true it seems to have made a new man of me it was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over i felt impotent and in the dark and distrustful but now that i know i am not afraid even of the count he has succeeded after all then in his design in getting to london and it was he i saw he has got younger and how van helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out if he is anything like what mina says we sat late and talked it all over mina is dressing and i shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over ,Dracula
by your letter to mina last night i was in doubt and then everything took a hue of unreality and i did not know what to trust even the evidence of my own senses not knowing what to trust i did not know what to do and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life the groove ceased to avail me and i mistrusted myself doctor you dont know what it is to doubt everything even yourself no you dont you couldnt with eyebrows like yours he seemed pleased and laughed as he said ,Dracula
so you are physiognomist i learn more here with each hour i am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast and oh sir you will pardon praise from an old man but you are blessed in your wife i would listen to him go on praising mina for a day so i simply nodded and stood silent ,Dracula
she is one of gods women fashioned by his own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter and that its light can be here on earth so true so sweet so noble so little an egoistand that let me tell you is much in this age so sceptical and selfish and you siri have read all the letters to poor miss lucy and some of them speak of you so i know you since some days from the knowing of others but i have seen your true self since last night you will give me your hand will you not and let us be friends for all our lives ,Dracula
and now he said may i ask you for some more help i have a great task to do and at the beginning it is to know you can help me here can you tell me what went before your going to transylvania later on i may ask more help and of a different kind but at first this will do ,Dracula
i had got him the morning papers and the london papers of the previous night and while we were talking at the carriage window waiting for the train to start he was turning them over his eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them the westminster gazettei knew it by the colourand he grew quite white he read something intently groaning to himself mein gott mein gott so soon so soon i do not think he remembered me at the moment just then the whistle blew and the train moved off this recalled him to himself and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand calling out love to madam mina i shall write so soon as ever i can ,Dracula
 septembertruly there is no such thing as finality not a week since i said finis and yet here i am starting fresh again or rather going on with the same record until this afternoon i had no cause to think of what is done renfield had become to all intents as sane as he ever was he was already well ahead with his fly business and he had just started in the spider line also so he had not been of any trouble to me i had a letter from arthur written on sunday and from it i gather that he is bearing up wonderfully well quincey morris is with him and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits quincey wrote me a line too and from him i hear that arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy so as to them all my mind is at rest as for myself i was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which i used to have for it so that i might fairly have said that the wound which poor lucy left on me was becoming cicatrised everything is however now reopened and what is to be the end god only knows i have an idea that van helsing thinks he knows too but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity he went to exeter yesterday and stayed there all night today he came back and almost bounded into the room at about halfpast five oclock and thrust last nights westminster gazette into my hand ,Dracula
i looked over the paper for i really did not know what he meant but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being decoyed away at hampstead it did not convey much to me until i reached a passage where it described small punctured wounds on their throats an idea struck me and i looked up well he said ,Dracula
how do you mean professor i asked i was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightlyfor after all four days of rest and freedom from burning harrowing anxiety does help to restore ones spiritsbut when i saw his face it sobered me never even in the midst of our despair about poor lucy had he looked more stern ,Dracula
you are clever man friend john you reason well and your wit is bold but you are too prejudiced you do not let your eyes see nor your ears hear and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you do you not think that there are things which you cannot understand and yet which are that some people see things that others cannot but there are things old and new which must not be contemplate by mens eyes because they knowor think they knowsome things which other men have told them ah it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all and if it explain not then it says there is nothing to explain but yet we see around us every day the growth of new beliefs which think themselves new and which are yet but the old which pretend to be younglike the fine ladies at the opera i suppose now you do not believe in corporeal transference no nor in materialisation no nor in astral bodies no nor in the reading of thought no nor in hypnotism ,Dracula
yes i said charcot has proved that pretty well he smiled as he went on then you are satisfied as to it yes and of course then you understand how it act and can follow the mind of the great charcotalas that he is no moreinto the very soul of the patient that he influence no then friend john am i to take it that you simply accept fact and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank no then tell mefor i am student of the brainhow you accept the hypnotism and reject the thought reading let me tell you my friend that there are things done today in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very men who discovered electricitywho would themselves not so long before have been burned as wizards there are always mysteries in life why was it that methuselah lived nine hundred years and old parr one hundred and sixtynine and yet that poor lucy with four mens blood in her poor veins could not live even one day for had she live one more day we could have save her do you know all the mystery of life and death do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men and not in others can you tell me why when other spiders die small and soon that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old spanish church and grew and grew till on descending he could drink the oil of all the church lamps can you tell me why in the pampas ay and elsewhere there are bats that come at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins how in some islands of the western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day and those who have seen describe as like giant nuts or pods and that when the sailors sleep on the deck because that it is hot flit down on them and thenand then in the morning are found dead men white as even miss lucy was ,Dracula
good god professor i said starting up do you mean to tell me that lucy was bitten by such a bat and that such a thing is here in london in the nineteenth century he waved his hand for silence and went on ,Dracula
can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men why the elephant goes on and on till he have seen dynasties and why the parrot never die only of bite of cat or dog or other complaint can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are some few who live on always if they be permit that there are men and women who cannot die we all knowbecause science has vouched for the factthat there have been toads shut up in rocks for thousands of years shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world can you tell me how the indian fakir can make himself to die and have been buried and his grave sealed and corn sowed on it and the corn reaped and be cut and sown and reaped and cut again and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there lie the indian fakir not dead but that rise up and walk amongst them as before here i interrupted him i was getting bewildered he so crowded on my mind his list of natures eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired i had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson as long ago he used to do in his study at amsterdam but he used then to tell me the thing so that i could have the object of thought in mind all the time but now i was without this help yet i wanted to follow him so i said ,Dracula
professor let me be your pet student again tell me the thesis so that i may apply your knowledge as you go on at present i am going in my mind from point to point as a mad man and not a sane one follows an idea i feel like a novice lumbering through a bog in a mist jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where i am going ,Dracula
to believe in things that you cannot let me illustrate i heard once of an american who so defined faith that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue for one i follow that man he meant that we shall have an open mind and not let a little bit of truth check the rush of a big truth like a small rock does a railway truck we get the small truth first good we keep him and we value him but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe ,Dracula
ah you are my favourite pupil still it is worth to teach you now that you are willing to understand you have taken the first step to understand you think then that those so small holes in the childrens throats were made by the same that made the hole in miss lucy ,Dracula
dr van helsing are you mad he raised his head and looked at me and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once would i were he said madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this oh my friend why think you did i go so far round why take so long to tell you so simple a thing was it because i hate you and have hated you all my life was it because i wished to give you pain was it that i wanted now so late revenge for that time when you saved my life and from a fearful death ah no ,Dracula
my friend it was because i wished to be gentle in the breaking to you for i know you have loved that so sweet lady but even yet i do not expect you to believe it is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the no of it it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth and of such a one as miss lucy tonight i go to prove it dare you come with me ,Dracula
the logic is simple no madmans logic this time jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog if it be not true then proof will be relief at worst it will not harm if it be true ah there is the dread yet very dread should help my cause for in it is some need of belief come i tell you what i propose first that we go off now and see that child in the hospital dr vincent of the north hospital where the papers say the child is is friend of mine and i think of yours since you were in class at amsterdam he will let two scientists see his case if he will not let two friends we shall tell him nothing but only that we wish to learn and then ,Dracula
and then he took a key from his pocket and held it up and then we spend the night you and i in the churchyard where lucy lies this is the key that lock the tomb i had it from the coffinman to give to arthur my heart sank within me for i felt that there was some fearful ordeal before us i could do nothing however so i plucked up what heart i could and said that we had better hasten as the afternoon was passing ,Dracula
we found the child awake it had had a sleep and taken some food and altogether was going on well dr vincent took the bandage from its throat and showed us the punctures there was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on lucys throat they were smaller and the edges looked fresher that was all we asked vincent to what he attributed them and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal perhaps a rat but for his own part he was inclined to think that it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of london out of so many harmless ones he said there may be some wild specimen from the south of a more malignant species some sailor may have brought one home and it managed to escape or even from the zological gardens a young one may have got loose or one be bred there from a vampire these things do occur you know only ten days ago a wolf got out and was i believe traced up in this direction for a week after the children were playing nothing but red riding hood on the heath and in every alley in the place until this bloofer lady scare came along since when it has been quite a galatime with them even this poor little mite when he woke up today asked the nurse if he might go away when she asked him why he wanted to go he said he wanted to play with the bloofer lady ,Dracula
i hope said van helsing that when you are sending the child home you will caution its parents to keep strict watch over it these fancies to stray are most dangerous and if the child were to remain out another night it would probably be fatal but in any case i suppose you will not let it away for some days ,Dracula
we dined at jack straws castle along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy about ten oclock we started from the inn it was then very dark and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius the professor had evidently noted the road we were to go for he went on unhesitatingly but as for me i was in quite a mixup as to locality as we went further we met fewer and fewer people till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round at last we reached the wall of the churchyard which we climbed over with some little difficultyfor it was very dark and the whole place seemed so strange to uswe found the westenra tomb the professor took the key opened the creaky door and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to precede him there was a delicious irony in the offer in the courtliness of giving preference on such a ghastly occasion my companion followed me quickly and cautiously drew the door to after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling and not a spring one in the latter case we should have been in a bad plight then he fumbled in his bag and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle proceeded to make a light the tomb in the daytime and when wreathed with fresh flowers had looked grim and gruesome enough but now some days afterwards when the flowers hung lank and dead their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns when the spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance when timediscoloured stone and dustencrusted mortar and rusty dank iron and tarnished brass and clouded silverplating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined it conveyed irresistibly the idea that lifeanimal lifewas not the only thing which could pass away ,Dracula
van helsing went about his work systematically holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal he made assurance of lucys coffin another search in his bag and he took out a turnscrew ,Dracula
to open the coffin you shall yet be convinced straightway he began taking out the screws and finally lifted off the lid showing the casing of lead beneath the sight was almost too much for me it seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living i actually took hold of his hand to stop him he only said you shall see and again fumbling in his bag took out a tiny fretsaw striking the turnscrew through the lead with a swift downward stab which made me wince he made a small hole which was however big enough to admit the point of the saw i had expected a rush of gas from the weekold corpse we doctors who have had to study our dangers have to become accustomed to such things and i drew back towards the door but the professor never stopped for a moment he sawed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin and then across and down the other side taking the edge of the loose flange he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin and holding up the candle into the aperture motioned to me to look ,Dracula
it was certainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock but van helsing was unmoved he was now more sure than ever of his ground and so emboldened to proceed in his task are you satisfied now friend john he asked ,Dracula
perhaps a bodysnatcher i suggested some of the undertakers people may have stolen it i felt that i was speaking folly and yet it was the only real cause which i could suggest the professor sighed ah well he said we must have more proof come with me ,Dracula
he put on the coffinlid again gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag blew out the light and placed the candle also in the bag we opened the door and went out behind us he closed the door and locked it he handed me the key saying will you keep it you had better be assured i laughedit was not a very cheerful laugh i am bound to sayas i motioned him to keep it a key is nothing i said there may be duplicates and anyhow it is not difficult to pick a lock of that kind he said nothing but put the key in his pocket then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other i took up my place behind a yewtree and i saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight ,Dracula
it was a lonely vigil just after i had taken my place i heard a distant clock strike twelve and in time came one and two i was chilled and unnerved and angry with the professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming i was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had a dreary miserable time ,Dracula
suddenly as i turned round i thought i saw something like a white streak moving between two dark yewtrees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb at the same time a dark mass moved from the professors side of the ground and hurriedly went towards it then i too moved but i had to go round headstones and railedoff tombs and i stumbled over graves the sky was overcast and somewhere far off an early cock crew a little way off beyond a line of scattered junipertrees which marked the pathway to the church a white dim figure flitted in the direction of the tomb the tomb itself was hidden by trees and i could not see where the figure disappeared i heard the rustle of actual movement where i had first seen the white figure and coming over found the professor holding in his arms a tiny child when he saw me he held it out to me and said ,Dracula
we had now to decide what we were to do with the child and so consulted about it if we were to take it to a policestation we should have to give some account of our movements during the night at least we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child so finally we decided that we would take it to the heath and when we heard a policeman coming would leave it where he could not fail to find it we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could all fell out well at the edge of hampstead heath we heard a policemans heavy tramp and laying the child on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro we heard his exclamation of astonishment and then we went away silently by good chance we got a cab near the spaniards and drove to town ,Dracula
 septemberit was two oclock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt the funeral held at noon was all completed and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away when looking carefully from behind a clump of aldertrees we saw the sexton lock the gate after him we knew then that we were safe till morning did we desire it but the professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most again i felt that horrid sense of the reality of things in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place and i realised distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unhallowed work besides i felt it was all so useless outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin to see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again when we knew from the evidence of our own eyesight that the coffin was empty i shrugged my shoulders however and rested silent for van helsing had a way of going on his own road no matter who remonstrated he took the key opened the vault and again courteously motioned me to precede the place was not so gruesome as last night but oh how unutterably meanlooking when the sunshine streamed in van helsing walked over to lucys coffin and i followed he bent over and again forced back the leaden flange and then a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me ,Dracula
there lay lucy seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral she was if possible more radiantly beautiful than ever and i could not believe that she was dead the lips were red nay redder than before and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom ,Dracula
see he went on see they are even sharper than before with this and thisand he touched one of the canine teeth and that below itthe little children can be bitten are you of belief now friend john once more argumentative hostility woke within me i could not accept such an overwhelming idea as he suggested so with an attempt to argue of which i was even at the moment ashamed i said ,Dracula
and yet she has been dead one week most peoples in that time would not look so i had no answer for this so was silent van helsing did not seem to notice my silence at any rate he showed neither chagrin nor triumph he was looking intently at the face of the dead woman raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth then he turned to me and said ,Dracula
here there is one thing which is different from all recorded here is some dual life that is not as the common she was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance sleepwalkingoh you start you do not know that friend john but you shall know it all laterand in trance could he best come to take more blood in trance she died and in trance she is undead too so it is that she differ from all other usually when the undead sleep at homeas he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was hometheir face show what they are but this so sweet that was when she not undead she go back to the nothings of the common dead there is no malign there see and so it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep this turned my blood cold and it began to dawn upon me that i was accepting van helsings theories but if she were really dead what was there of terror in the idea of killing her he looked up at me and evidently saw the change in my face for he said almost joyously ,Dracula
i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic and i shall drive a stake through her body it made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom i had loved and yet the feeling was not so strong as i had expected i was in fact beginning to shudder at the presence of this being this undead as van helsing called it and to loathe it is it possible that love is all subjective or all objective ,Dracula
i have been thinking and have made up my mind as to what is best if i did simply follow my inclining i would do now at this moment what is to be done but there are other things to follow and things that are thousand times more difficult in that them we do not know this is simple she have yet no life taken though that is of time and to act now would be to take danger from her for ever but then we may have to want arthur and how shall we tell him of this if you who saw the wounds on lucys throat and saw the wounds so similar on the childs at the hospital if you who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week after she dieif you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard and yet of your own senses you did not believe how then can i expect arthur who know none of those things to believe he doubted me when i took him from her kiss when she was dying i know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea i have done things that prevent him say goodbye as he ought and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive and that in most mistake of all we have killed her he will then argue back that it is we mistaken ones that have killed her by our ideas and so he will be much unhappy always yet he never can be sure and that is the worst of all and he will sometimes think that she he loved was buried alive and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered and again he will think that we may be right and that his so beloved was after all an undead no i told him once and since then i learn much now since i know it is all true a hundred thousand times more do i know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet he poor fellow must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him then we can act for good all round and send him peace my mind is made up let us go you return home for tonight to your asylum and see that all be well as for me i shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way tomorrow night you will come to me to the berkeley hotel at ten of the clock i shall send for arthur to come too and also that so fine young man of america that gave his blood later we shall all have work to do i come with you so far as piccadilly and there dine for i must be back here before the sun set ,Dracula
i write this in case anything should happen i go alone to watch in that churchyard it pleases me that the undead miss lucy shall not leave tonight that so on the morrow night she may be more eager therefore i shall fix some things she like notgarlic and a crucifixand so seal up the door of the tomb she is young as undead and will heed moreover these are only to prevent her coming out they may not prevail on her wanting to get in for then the undead is desperate and must find the line of least resistance whatsoever it may be i shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after the sunrise and if there be aught that may be learned i shall learn it for miss lucy or from her i have no fear but that other to whom is there that she is undead he have now the power to seek her tomb and find shelter he is cunning as i know from mr jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for miss lucys life and we lost and in many ways the undead are strong he have always the strength in his hand of twenty men even we four who gave our strength to miss lucy it also is all to him besides he can summon his wolf and i know not what so if it be that he come thither on this night he shall find me but none other shalluntil it be too late but it may be that he will not attempt the place there is no reason why he should his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the undead woman sleep and the one old man watch ,Dracula
therefore i write this in case take the papers that are with this the diaries of harker and the rest and read them and then find this great undead and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it so that the world may rest from him ,Dracula
 septemberit is wonderful what a good nights sleep will do for one yesterday i was almost willing to accept van helsings monstrous ideas but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrages on common sense i have no doubt that he believes it all i wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged surely there must be some rational explanation of all these mysterious things is it possible that the professor can have done it himself he is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way i am loath to think it and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that van helsing was mad but anyhow i shall watch him carefully i may get some light on the mystery ,Dracula
 september morning last night at a little before ten oclock arthur and quincey came into van helsings room he told us all that he wanted us to do but especially addressing himself to arthur as if all our wills were centred in his he began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too for he said there is a grave duty to be done there you were doubtless surprised at my letter this query was directly addressed to lord godalming ,Dracula
i was it rather upset me for a bit there has been so much trouble around my house of late that i could do without any more i have been curious too as to what you mean quincey and i talked it over but the more we talked the more puzzled we got till now i can say for myself that im about up a tree as to any meaning about anything ,Dracula
i want your permission to do what i think good this night it is i know much to ask and when you know what it is i propose to do you will know and only then how much therefore may i ask that you promise me in the dark so that afterwards though you may be angry with me for a timei must not disguise from myself the possibility that such may beyou shall not blame yourselves for anything ,Dracula
dr van helsing i dont quite like to buy a pig in a poke as they say in scotland and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman or my faith as a christian is concerned i cannot make such a promise if you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two then i give my consent at once though for the life of me i cannot understand what you are driving at ,Dracula
i accept your limitation said van helsing and all i ask of you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations ,Dracula
professor are you in earnest or it is some monstrous joke pardon me i see that you are in earnest he sat down again but i could see that he sat firmly and proudly as one who is on his dignity there was silence until he asked again ,Dracula
this is too much he said angrily rising again i am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable but in thisthis desecration of the graveof one who he fairly choked with indignation the professor looked pityingly at him ,Dracula
heavens and earth no cried arthur in a storm of passion not for the wide world will i consent to any mutilation of her dead body dr van helsing you try me too far what have i done to you that you should torture me so what did that poor sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave are you mad to speak such things or am i mad to listen to them dont dare to think more of such a desecration i shall not give my consent to anything you do i have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage and by god i shall do it ,Dracula
my lord godalming i too have a duty to do a duty to others a duty to you a duty to the dead and by god i shall do it all i ask you now is that you come with me that you look and listen and if when later i make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfilment even than i am thenthen i shall do my duty whatever it may seem to me and then to follow of your lordships wishes i shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and where you will his voice broke a little and he went on with a voice full of pity ,Dracula
but i beseech you do not go forth in anger with me in a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do and which sometimes did wring my heart i have never had so heavy a task as now believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour for i would do what a man can to save you from sorrow just think for why should i give myself so much of labour and so much of sorrow i have come here from my own land to do what i can of good at the first to please my friend john and then to help a sweet young lady whom too i came to love for heri am ashamed to say so much but i say it in kindnessi gave what you gave the blood of my veins i gave it i who was not like you her lover but only her physician and her friend i gave to her my nights and daysbefore death after death and if my death can do her good even now when she is the dead undead she shall have it freely he said this with a very grave sweet pride and arthur was much affected by it he took the old mans hand and said in a broken voice ,Dracula
it was just a quarter before twelve oclock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall the night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the rents of the heavy clouds that scudded across the sky we all kept somehow close together with van helsing slightly in front as he led the way when we had come close to the tomb i looked well at arthur for i feared that the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him but he bore himself well i took it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way a counteractant to his grief the professor unlocked the door and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons solved the difficulty by entering first himself the rest of us followed and he closed the door he then lit a dark lantern and pointed to the coffin arthur stepped forward hesitatingly van helsing said to me ,Dracula
you hear and yet there is no one who does not believe with me he took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin arthur looked on very pale but silent when the lid was removed he stepped forward he evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin or at any rate had not thought of it when he saw the rent in the lead the blood rushed to his face for an instant but as quickly fell away again so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness he was still silent van helsing forced back the leaden flange and we all looked in and recoiled ,Dracula
professor i answered for you your word is all i want i wouldnt ask such a thing ordinarilyi wouldnt so dishonour you as to imply a doubt but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour is this your doing ,Dracula
i swear to you by all that i hold sacred that i have not removed nor touched her what happened was this two nights ago my friend seward and i came herewith good purpose believe me i opened that coffin which was then sealed up and we found it as now empty we then waited and saw something white come through the trees the next day we came here in daytime and she lay there did she not friend john ,Dracula
that night we were just in time one more so small child was missing and we find it thank god unharmed amongst the graves yesterday i came here before sundown for at sundown the undead can move i waited here all the night till the sun rose but i saw nothing it was most probable that it was because i had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic which the undead cannot bear and other things which they shun last night there was no exodus so tonight before the sundown i took away my garlic and other things and so it is we find this coffin empty but bear with me so far there is much that is strange wait you with me outside unseen and unheard and things much stranger are yet to be sohere he shut the dark slide of his lanternnow to the outside he opened the door and we filed out he coming last and locking the door behind him ,Dracula
oh but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault how sweet it was to see the clouds race by and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scudding clouds crossing and passinglike the gladness and sorrow of a mans life how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air that had no taint of death and decay how humanising to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill and to hear far away the muffled roar that marks the life of a great city each in his own way was solemn and overcome arthur was silent and was i could see striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery i was myself tolerably patient and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept van helsings conclusions quincey morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things and accepts them in the spirit of cool bravery with hazard of all he has to stake not being able to smoke he cut himself a goodsized plug of tobacco and began to chew as to van helsing he was employed in a definite way first he took from his bag a mass of what looked like thin waferlike biscuit which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin next he took out a doublehandful of some whitish stuff like dough or putty he crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands this he then took and rolling it into thin strips began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb i was somewhat puzzled at this and being close asked him what it was that he was doing arthur and quincey drew near also as they too were curious he answered ,Dracula
the host i brought it from amsterdam i have an indulgence it was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the professors a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things it was impossible to distrust in respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb but hidden from the sight of any one approaching i pitied the others especially arthur i had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror and yet i who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs felt my heart sink within me never did tombs look so ghastly white never did cypress or yew or juniper so seem the embodiment of funereal gloom never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously never did bough creak so mysteriously and never did the faraway howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night ,Dracula
there was a long spell of silence a big aching void and then from the professor a keen ssss he pointed and far down the avenue of yews we saw a white figure advancea dim white figure which held something dark at its breast the figure stopped and at the moment a ray of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a darkhaired woman dressed in the cerements of the grave we could not see the face for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fairhaired child there was a pause and a sharp little cry such as a child gives in sleep or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams we were starting forward but the professors warning hand seen by us as he stood behind a yewtree kept us back and then as we looked the white figure moved forwards again it was now near enough for us to see clearly and the moonlight still held my own heart grew cold as ice and i could hear the gasp of arthur as we recognised the features of lucy westenra lucy westenra but yet how changed the sweetness was turned to adamantine heartless cruelty and the purity to voluptuous wantonness van helsing stepped out and obedient to his gesture we all advanced too the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb van helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide by the concentrated light that fell on lucys face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood and that the stream had trickled over her chin and stained the purity of her lawn deathrobe ,Dracula
when lucyi call the thing that was before us lucy because it bore her shapesaw us she drew back with an angry snarl such as a cat gives when taken unawares then her eyes ranged over us lucys eyes in form and colour but lucys eyes unclean and full of hellfire instead of the pure gentle orbs we knew at that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing had she then to be killed i could have done it with savage delight as she looked her eyes blazed with unholy light and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile oh god how it made me shudder to see it with a careless motion she flung to the ground callous as a devil the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast growling over it as a dog growls over a bone the child gave a sharp cry and lay there moaning there was a coldbloodedness in the act which wrung a groan from arthur when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands ,Dracula
there was something diabolically sweet in her tonessomething of the tingling of glass when struckwhich rang through the brains even of us who heard the words addressed to another as for arthur he seemed under a spell moving his hands from his face he opened wide his arms she was leaping for them when van helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix she recoiled from it and with a suddenly distorted face full of rage dashed past him as if to enter the tomb ,Dracula
when within a foot or two of the door however she stopped as if arrested by some irresistible force then she turned and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which had now no quiver from van helsings iron nerves never did i see such baffled malice on a face and never i trust shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes the beautiful colour became livid the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hellfire the brows were wrinkled as though the folds of the flesh were the coils of medusas snakes and the lovely bloodstained mouth grew to an open square as in the passion masks of the greeks and japanese if ever a face meant deathif looks could killwe saw it at that moment ,Dracula
do as you will friend do as you will there can be no horror like this ever any more and he groaned in spirit quincey and i simultaneously moved towards him and took his arms we could hear the click of the closing lantern as van helsing held it down coming close to the tomb he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there we all looked on in horrified amazement as we saw when he stood back the woman with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own pass in through the interstice where scarce a knifeblade could have gone we all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door ,Dracula
come now my friends we can do no more till tomorrow there is a funeral at noon so here we shall all come before long after that the friends of the dead will all be gone by two and when the sexton lock the gate we shall remain then there is more to do but not like this of tonight as for this little one he is not much harm and by tomorrow night he shall be well we shall leave him where the police will find him as on the other night and then to home coming close to arthur he said ,Dracula
my friend arthur you have had a sore trial but after when you look back you will see how it was necessary you are now in the bitter waters my child by this time tomorrow you will please god have passed them and have drunk of the sweet waters so do not mourn overmuch till then i shall not ask you to forgive me ,Dracula
 september nighta little before twelve oclock we threearthur quincey morris and myselfcalled for the professor it was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes of course arthur wore black for he was in deep mourning but the rest of us wore it by instinct we got to the churchyard by halfpast one and strolled about keeping out of official observation so that when the gravediggers had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that every one had gone had locked the gate we had the place all to ourselves van helsing instead of his little black bag had with him a long leather one something like a cricketing bag it was manifestly of fair weight ,Dracula
when we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road we silently and as if by ordered intention followed the professor to the tomb he unlocked the door and we entered closing it behind us then he took from his bag the lantern which he lit and also two wax candles which when lighted he stuck by melting their own ends on other coffins so that they might give light sufficient to work by when he again lifted the lid off lucys coffin we all lookedarthur trembling like an aspenand saw that the body lay there in all its deathbeauty but there was no love in my own heart nothing but loathing for the foul thing which had taken lucys shape without her soul i could see even arthurs face grow hard as he looked presently he said to van helsing ,Dracula
she seemed like a nightmare of lucy as she lay there the pointed teeth the bloodstained voluptuous mouthwhich it made one shudder to seethe whole carnal and unspiritual appearance seeming like a devilish mockery of lucys sweet purity van helsing with his usual methodicalness began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use first he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder and then a small oillamp which gave out when lit in a corner of the tomb gas which burned at fierce heat with a blue flame then his operating knives which he placed to hand and last a round wooden stake some two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long one end of it was hardened by charring in the fire and was sharpened to a fine point with this stake came a heavy hammer such as in households is used in the coalcellar for breaking the lumps to me a doctors preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing but the effect of these things on both arthur and quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation they both however kept their courage and remained silent and quiet ,Dracula
before we do anything let me tell you this it is out of the lore and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the undead when they become such there comes with the change the curse of immortality they cannot die but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world for all that die from the preying of the undead becomes themselves undead and prey on their kind and so the circle goes on ever widening like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water friend arthur if you had met that kiss which you know of before poor lucy die or again last night when you open your arms to her you would in time when you had died have become nosferatu as they call it in eastern europe and would all time make more of those undeads that so have fill us with horror the career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun those children whose blood she suck are not as yet so much the worse but if she live on undead more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth but if she die in truth then all cease the tiny wounds of the throats disappear and they go back to their plays unknowing ever of what has been but of the most blessed of all when this now undead be made to rest as true dead then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day she shall take her place with the other angels so that my friend it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free to this i am willing but is there none amongst us who has a better right will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not it was my hand that sent her to the stars it was the hand of him that loved her best the hand that of all she would herself have chosen had it been to her to choose tell me if there be such a one amongst us ,Dracula
we all looked at arthur he saw too what we all did the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore lucy to us as a holy and not an unholy memory he stepped forward and said bravely though his hand trembled and his face was as pale as snow ,Dracula
brave lad a moments courage and it is done this stake must be driven through her it will be a fearful ordealbe not deceived in thatbut it will be only a short time and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air but you must not falter when once you have begun only think that we your true friends are round you and that we pray for you all the time ,Dracula
take this stake in your left hand ready to place the point over the heart and the hammer in your right then when we begin our prayer for the deadi shall read him i have here the book and the others shall followstrike in gods name that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the undead pass away ,Dracula
arthur took the stake and the hammer and when once his mind was set on action his hands never trembled nor even quivered van helsing opened his missal and began to read and quincey and i followed as well as we could arthur placed the point over the heart and as i looked i could see its dint in the white flesh then he struck with all his might ,Dracula
the thing in the coffin writhed and a hideous bloodcurdling screech came from the opened red lips the body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions the sharp white teeth champed together till the lips were cut and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam but arthur never faltered he looked like a figure of thor as his untrembling arm rose and fell driving deeper and deeper the mercybearing stake whilst the blood from the pierced heart welled and spurted up around it his face was set and high duty seemed to shine through it the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault ,Dracula
the hammer fell from arthurs hand he reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him the great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead and his breath came in broken gasps it had indeed been an awful strain on him and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it for a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin when we did however a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us we gazed so eagerly that arthur rose for he had been seated on the ground and came and looked too and then a glad strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it ,Dracula
there in the coffin lay no longer the foul thing that we had so dreaded and grown to hate that the work of her destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it but lucy as we had seen her in her life with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity true that there were there as we had seen them in life the traces of care and pain and waste but these were all dear to us for they marked her truth to what we knew one and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was to reign for ever ,Dracula
forgiven god bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again and me peace he put his hands on the professors shoulder and laying his head on his breast cried for a while silently whilst we stood unmoving when he raised his head van helsing said to him ,Dracula
and now my child you may kiss her kiss her dead lips if you will as she would have you to if for her to choose for she is not a grinning devil nownot any more a foul thing for all eternity no longer she is the devils undead she is gods true dead whose soul is with him ,Dracula
arthur bent and kissed her and then we sent him and quincey out of the tomb the professor and i sawed the top off the stake leaving the point of it in the body then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic we soldered up the leaden coffin screwed on the coffinlid and gathering up our belongings came away when the professor locked the door he gave the key to arthur ,Dracula
outside the air was sweet the sun shone and the birds sang and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch there was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere for we were at rest ourselves on one account and we were glad though it was with a tempered joy ,Dracula
now my friends one step of our work is done one the most harrowing to ourselves but there remains a greater task to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out i have clues which we can follow but it is a long task and a difficult and there is danger in it and pain shall you not all help me we have learned to believe all of usis it not so and since so do we not see our duty yes and do we not promise to go on to the bitter end ,Dracula
two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend john i shall entreat two others two that you know not as yet and i shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold friend john you come with me home for i have much to consult about and you can help me tonight i leave for amsterdam but shall return tomorrow night and then begins our great quest but first i shall have much to say so that you may know what is to do and to dread then our promise shall be made to each other anew for there is a terrible task before us and once our feet are on the ploughshare we must not draw back ,Dracula
the professor was delighted ah that wonderful madam mina he said pearl among women she arrive but i cannot stay she must go to your house friend john you must meet her at the station telegraph her en route so that she may be prepared ,Dracula
when the wire was despatched he had a cup of tea over it he told me of a diary kept by jonathan harker when abroad and gave me a typewritten copy of it as also of mrs harkers diary at whitby take these he said and study them well when i have returned you will be master of all the facts and we can then better enter on our inquisition keep them safe for there is in them much of treasure you will need all your faith even you who have had such an experience as that of today what is here told he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another or it may sound the knell of the undead who walk the earth read all i pray you with the open mind and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so for it is allimportant you have kept diary of all these so strange things is it not so yes then we shall go through all these together when we meet he then made ready for his departure and shortly after drove off to liverpool street i took my way to paddington where i arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in ,Dracula
the crowd melted away after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms and i was beginning to feel uneasy lest i might miss my guest when a sweetfaced daintylooking girl stepped up to me and after a quick glance said dr seward is it not ,Dracula
the blush that rose to my own cheeks somehow set us both at ease for it was a tacit answer to her own i got her luggage which included a typewriter and we took the underground to fenchurch street after i had sent a wire to my housekeeper to have a sittingroom and bedroom prepared at once for mrs harker ,Dracula
she told me that if she might she would come presently to my study as she had much to say so here i am finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst i await her as yet i have not had the chance of looking at the papers which van helsing left with me though they lie open before me i must get her interested in something so that i may have an opportunity of reading them she does not know how precious time is or what a task we have in hand i must be careful not to frighten her here she is ,Dracula
 septemberafter i had tidied myself i went down to dr sewards study at the door i paused a moment for i thought i heard him talking with some one as however he had pressed me to be quick i knocked at the door and on his calling out come in i entered ,Dracula
to my intense surprise there was no one with him he was quite alone and on the table opposite him was what i knew at once from the description to be a phonograph i had never seen one and was much interested ,Dracula
the fact is he began awkwardly i only keep my diary in it and as it is entirelyalmost entirelyabout my cases it may be awkwardthat is i mean he stopped and i tried to help him out of his embarrassment ,Dracula
you see i do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him and he said with unconscious simplicity in a different voice and with the navet of a child thats quite true upon my honour honest indian i could not but smile at which he grimaced i gave myself away that time he said but do you know that although i have kept the diary for months past it never once struck me how i was going to find any particular part of it in case i wanted to look it up by this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being and i said boldly ,Dracula
then it was terrible my intuition was right for a moment i thought and as my eyes ranged the room unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to aid me they lit on a great batch of typewriting on the table his eyes caught the look in mine and without his thinking followed their direction as they saw the parcel he realised my meaning ,Dracula
you do not know me i said when you have read those papersmy own diary and my husbands also which i have typedyou will know me better i have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause but of course you do not know meyet and i must not expect you to trust me so far ,Dracula
he is certainly a man of noble nature poor dear lucy was right about him he stood up and opened a large drawer in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax and said ,Dracula
you are quite right i did not trust you because i did not know you but i know you now and let me say that i should have known you long ago i know that lucy told you of me she told me of you too may i make the only atonement in my power take the cylinders and hear themthe first halfdozen of them are personal to me and they will not horrify you then you will know me better dinner will by then be ready in the meantime i shall read over some of these documents and shall be better able to understand certain things he carried the phonograph himself up to my sittingroom and adjusted it for me now i shall learn something pleasant i am sure for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which i know one side already ,Dracula
 septemberi was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of jonathan harker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on without thinking mrs harker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner so i said she is possibly tired let dinner wait an hour and i went on with my work i had just finished mrs harkers diary when she came in she looked sweetly pretty but very sad and her eyes were flushed with crying this somehow moved me much of late i have had cause for tears god knows but the relief of them was denied me and now the sight of those sweet eyes brightened with recent tears went straight to my heart so i said as gently as i could ,Dracula
oh no not distressed me she replied but i have been more touched than i can say by your grief that is a wonderful machine but it is cruelly true it told me in its very tones the anguish of your heart it was like a soul crying out to almighty god no one must hear them spoken ever again see i have tried to be useful i have copied out the words on my typewriter and none other need now hear your heart beat as i did ,Dracula
because it is a part of the terrible story a part of poor dear lucys death and all that led to it because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get i think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know but i can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery you will let me help will you not i know all up to a certain point and i see already though your diary only took me to  september how poor lucy was beset and how her terrible doom was being wrought out jonathan and i have been working day and night since professor van helsing saw us he is gone to whitby to get more information and he will be here tomorrow to help us we need have no secrets amongst us working together and with absolute trust we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark she looked at me so appealingly and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her bearing that i gave in at once to her wishes you shall i said do as you like in the matter god forgive me if i do wrong there are terrible things yet to learn of but if you have so far travelled on the road to poor lucys death you will not be content i know to remain in the dark nay the endthe very endmay give you a gleam of peace come there is dinner we must keep one another strong for what is before us we have a cruel and dreadful task when you have eaten you shall learn the rest and i shall answer any questions you askif there be anything which you do not understand though it was apparent to us who were present ,Dracula
 septemberafter dinner i came with dr seward to his study he brought back the phonograph from my room and i took my typewriter he placed me in a comfortable chair and arranged the phonograph so that i could touch it without getting up and showed me how to stop it in case i should want to pause then he very thoughtfully took a chair with his back to me so that i might be as free as possible and began to read i put the forked metal to my ears and listened ,Dracula
when the terrible story of lucys death andand all that followed was done i lay back in my chair powerless fortunately i am not of a fainting disposition when dr seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified exclamation and hurriedly taking a casebottle from a cupboard gave me some brandy which in a few minutes somewhat restored me my brain was all in a whirl and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors the holy ray of light that my dear dear lucy was at last at peace i do not think i could have borne it without making a scene it is all so wild and mysterious and strange that if i had not known jonathans experience in transylvania i could not have believed as it was i didnt know what to believe and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else i took the cover off my typewriter and said to dr seward ,Dracula
let me write this all out now we must be ready for dr van helsing when he comes i have sent a telegram to jonathan to come on here when he arrives in london from whitby in this matter dates are everything and i think that if we get all our material ready and have every item put in chronological order we shall have done much you tell me that lord godalming and mr morris are coming too let us be able to tell him when they come he accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace and i began to typewrite from the beginning of the seventh cylinder i used manifold and so took three copies of the diary just as i had done with all the rest it was late when i got through but dr seward went about his work of going his round of the patients when he had finished he came back and sat near me reading so that i did not feel too lonely whilst i worked how good and thoughtful he is the world seems full of good meneven if there are monsters in it before i left him i remembered what jonathan put in his diary of the professors perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at exeter so seeing that dr seward keeps his newspapers i borrowed the files of the westminster gazette and the pall mall gazette and took them to my room i remember how much the dailygraph and the whitby gazette of which i had made cuttings helped us to understand the terrible events at whitby when count dracula landed so i shall look through the evening papers since then and perhaps i shall get some new light i am not sleepy and the work will help to keep me quiet ,Dracula
 septembermr harker arrived at nine oclock he had got his wifes wire just before starting he is uncommonly clever if one can judge from his face and full of energy if this journal be trueand judging by ones own wonderful experiences it must behe is also a man of great nerve that going down to the vault a second time was a remarkable piece of daring after reading his account of it i was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood but hardly the quiet businesslike gentleman who came here today ,Dracula
laterafter lunch harker and his wife went back to their own room and as i passed a while ago i heard the click of the typewriter they are hard at it mrs harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at whitby and the carriers in london who took charge of them he is now reading his wifes typescript of my diary i wonder what they make out of it here it is ,Dracula
strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the counts hidingplace goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient renfield the bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the typescript oh if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor lucy stop that way madness lies harker has gone back and is again collating his material he says that by dinnertime they will be able to show a whole connected narrative he thinks that in the meantime i should see renfield as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the count i hardly see this yet but when i get at the dates i suppose i shall what a good thing that mrs harker put my cylinders into type we never could have found the dates otherwise ,Dracula
i found renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded smiling benignly at the moment he seemed as sane as any one i ever saw i sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects all of which he treated naturally he then of his own accord spoke of going home a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here in fact he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once i believe that had i not had the chat with harker and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts i should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation as it is i am darkly suspicious all those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the count what then does this absolute content mean can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampires ultimate triumph stay he is himself zophagous and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of master this all seems confirmation of our idea however after a while i came away my friend is just a little too sane at present to make it safe to probe him too deep with questions he might begin to think and then so i came away i mistrust these quiet moods of his so i have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him and to have a straitwaistcoat ready in case of need ,Dracula
 september in train to londonwhen i received mr billingtons courteous message that he would give me any information in his power i thought it best to go down to whitby and make on the spot such inquiries as i wanted it was now my object to trace that horrid cargo of the counts to its place in london later we may be able to deal with it billington junior a nice lad met me at the station and brought me to his fathers house where they had decided that i must stay the night they are hospitable with true yorkshire hospitality give a guest everything and leave him free to do as he likes they all knew that i was busy and that my stay was short and mr billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes it gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which i had seen on the counts table before i knew of his diabolical plans everything had been carefully thought out and done systematically and with precision he seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out to use an americanism he had taken no chances and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was simply the logical result of his care i saw the invoice and took note of it fifty cases of common earth to be used for experimental purposes also the copy of letter to carter paterson and their reply of both of these i got copies this was all the information mr billington could give me so i went down to the port and saw the coastguards the customs officers and the harbourmaster they had all something to say of the strange entry of the ship which is already taking its place in local tradition but no one could add to the simple description fifty cases of common earth i then saw the stationmaster who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes their tally was exact with the list and they had nothing to add except that the boxes were main and mortal heavy and that shifting them was dry work one of them added that it was hard lines that there wasnt any gentleman suchlike as yourself squire to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allayed it needless to add i took care before leaving to lift for ever and adequately this source of reproach ,Dracula
 septemberthe stationmaster was good enough to give me a line to his old companion the stationmaster at kings cross so that when i arrived there in the morning i was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes he too put me at once in communication with the proper officials and i saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice the opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited a noble use of them had however been made and again i was compelled to deal with the result in an ex post facto manner ,Dracula
from thence i went on to carter patersons central office where i met with the utmost courtesy they looked up the transaction in their daybook and letterbook and at once telephoned to their kings cross office for more details by good fortune the men who did the teaming were waiting for work and the official at once sent them over sending also by one of them the waybill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at carfax here again i found the tally agreeing exactly the carriers men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few details these were i shortly found connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job and of the consequent thirst engendered in the operators on my affording an opportunity through the medium of the currency of the realm of the allaying at a later period this beneficial evil one of the men remarked ,Dracula
that ere ouse guvnor is the rummiest i ever was in blyme but it aint been touched sence a hundred years there was dust that thick in the place that you might have slep on it without urtin of yer bones an the place was that neglected that yer might ave smelled ole jerusalem in it but the ole chapelthat took the cike that did me and my mate we thort we wouldnt never git out quick enough lor i wouldnt take less nor a quid a moment to stay there arter dark ,Dracula
of one thing i am now satisfied that all the boxes which arrived at whitby from varna in the demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at carfax there should be fifty of them there unless any have since been removedas from dr sewards diary i fear ,Dracula
 septemberi am so glad that i hardly know how to contain myself it is i suppose the reaction from the haunting fear which i have had that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on jonathan i saw him leave for whitby with as brave a face as i could but i was sick with apprehension the effort has however done him good he was never so resolute never so strong never so full of volcanic energy as at present it is just as that dear good professor van helsing said he is true grit and he improves under strain that would kill a weaker nature he came back full of life and hope and determination we have got everything in order for tonight i feel myself quite wild with excitement i suppose one ought to pity any thing so hunted as is the count that is just it this thing is not humannot even beast to read dr sewards account of poor lucys death and what followed is enough to dry up the springs of pity in ones heart ,Dracula
laterlord godalming and mr morris arrived earlier than we expected dr seward was out on business and had taken jonathan with him so i had to see them it was to me a painful meeting for it brought back all poor dear lucys hopes of only a few months ago of course they had heard lucy speak of me and it seemed that dr van helsing too has been quite blowing my trumpet as mr morris expressed it poor fellows neither of them is aware that i know all about the proposals they made to lucy they did not quite know what to say or do as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge so they had to keep on neutral subjects however i thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that the best thing i could do would be to post them in affairs right up to date i knew from dr sewards diary that they had been at lucys deathher real deathand that i need not fear to betray any secret before the time so i told them as well as i could that i had read all the papers and diaries and that my husband and i having typewritten them had just finished putting them in order i gave them each a copy to read in the library when lord godalming got his and turned it overit does make a pretty good pilehe said ,Dracula
i dont quite see the drift of it but you people are all so good and kind and have been working so earnestly and so energetically that all i can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you i have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life besides i know you loved my poor lucy here he turned away and covered his face with his hands i could hear the tears in his voice mr morris with instinctive delicacy just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder and then walked quietly out of the room i suppose there is something in womans nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood for when lord godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly i sat down beside him and took his hand i hope he didnt think it forward of me and that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought there i wrong him i know he never willhe is too true a gentleman i said to him for i could see that his heart was breaking ,Dracula
i loved dear lucy and i know what she was to you and what you were to her she and i were like sisters and now she is gone will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble i know what sorrows you have had though i cannot measure the depth of them if sympathy and pity can help in your affliction wont you let me be of some little servicefor lucys sake ,Dracula
in an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief it seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found a vent at once he grew quite hysterical and raising his open hands beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief he stood up and then sat down again and the tears rained down his cheeks i felt an infinite pity for him and opened my arms unthinkingly with a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child whilst he shook with emotion ,Dracula
we women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the motherspirit is invoked i felt this big sorrowing mans head resting on me as though it were that of the baby that some day may lie on my bosom and i stroked his hair as though he were my own child i never thought at the time how strange it all was ,Dracula
after a little bit his sobs ceased and he raised himself with an apology though he made no disguise of his emotion he told me that for days and nights pastweary days and sleepless nightshe had been unable to speak with any one as a man must speak in his time of sorrow there was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him or with whom owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded he could speak freely i know now how i suffered he said as he dried his eyes but i do not know even yetand none other can ever knowhow much your sweet sympathy has been to me today i shall know better in time and believe me that though i am not ungrateful now my gratitude will grow with my understanding you will let me be like a brother will you not for all our livesfor dear lucys sake ,Dracula
for dear lucys sake i said as we clasped hands ay and for your own sake he added for if a mans esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning you have won mine today if ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a mans help believe me you will not call in vain god grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life but if it should ever come promise me that you will let me know he was so earnest and his sorrow was so fresh that i felt it would comfort him so i said ,Dracula
as i came along the corridor i saw mr morris looking out of a window he turned as he heard my footsteps how is art he said then noticing my red eyes he went on ah i see you have been comforting him poor old fellow he needs it no one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart and he had no one to comfort him ,Dracula
i wish i could comfort all who suffer from the heart will you let me be your friend and will you come to me for comfort if you need it you will know later on why i speak he saw that i was in earnest and stooping took my hand and raising it to his lips kissed it it seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul and impulsively i bent over and kissed him the tears rose in his eyes and there was a momentary choking in his throat he said quite calmly ,Dracula
 septemberi got home at five oclock and found that godalming and morris had not only arrived but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which harker and his wonderful wife had made and arranged harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers men of whom dr hennessey had written to me mrs harker gave us a cup of tea and i can honestly say that for the first time since i have lived in it this old house seemed like home when we had finished mrs harker said ,Dracula
dr seward may i ask a favour i want to see your patient mr renfield do let me see him what you have said of him in your diary interests me so much she looked so appealing and so pretty that i could not refuse her and there was no possible reason why i should so i took her with me when i went into the room i told the man that a lady would like to see him to which he simply answered why ,Dracula
she is going through the house and wants to see every one in it i answered oh very well he said let her come in by all means but just wait a minute till i tidy up the place his method of tidying was peculiar he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before i could stop him it was quite evident that he feared or was jealous of some interference when he had got through his disgusting task he said cheerfully let the lady come in and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered for a moment i thought that he might have some homicidal intent i remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study and i took care to stand where i could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her she came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunaticfor easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect she walked over to him smiling pleasantly and held out her hand ,Dracula
goodevening mr renfield said she you see i know you for dr seward has told me of you he made no immediate reply but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face this look gave way to one of wonder which merged in doubt then to my intense astonishment he said ,Dracula
you will of course understand mrs harker that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is everything regarding him is of interest in our little community dr seward is loved not only by his household and his friends but even by his patients who being some of them hardly in mental equilibrium are apt to distort causes and effects since i myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum i cannot but notice that the sophistic tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non causa and ignoratio elenchi i positively opened my eyes at this new development here was my own pet lunaticthe most pronounced of his type that i had ever met withtalking elemental philosophy and with the manner of a polished gentleman i wonder if it was mrs harkers presence which had touched some chord in his memory if this new phase was spontaneous or in any way due to her unconscious influence she must have some rare gift or power ,Dracula
we continued to talk for some time and seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable she ventured looking at me questioningly as she began to lead him to his favourite topic i was again astonished for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the completest sanity he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things ,Dracula
why i myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief indeed it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed and insisted on my being put under control i used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity and that by consuming a multitude of live things no matter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolong life at times i held the belief so strongly that i actually tried to take human life the doctor here will bear me out that on one occasion i tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his bloodrelying of course upon the scriptural phrase for the blood is the life though indeed the vendor of a certain nostrum has vulgarised the truism to the very point of contempt isnt that true doctor i nodded assent for i was so amazed that i hardly knew what to either think or say it was hard to imagine that i had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before looking at my watch i saw that i should go to the station to meet van helsing so i told mrs harker that it was time to leave she came at once after saying pleasantly to mr renfield goodbye and i hope i may see you often under auspices pleasanter to yourself to which to my astonishment he replied ,Dracula
when i went to the station to meet van helsing i left the boys behind me poor art seemed more cheerful than he has been since lucy first took ill and quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day ,Dracula
ah friend john how goes all well so i have been busy for i come here to stay if need be all affairs are settled with me and i have much to tell madam mina is with you yes and her so fine husband and arthur and my friend quincey they are with you too good ,Dracula
ah that wonderful madam mina she has mans braina brain that a man should have were he much giftedand a womans heart the good god fashioned her for a purpose believe me when he made that so good combination friend john up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us after tonight she must not have to do with this so terrible affair it is not good that she run a risk so great we men are determinednay are we not pledgedto destroy this monster but it is no part for a woman even if she be not harmed her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may sufferboth in waking from her nerves and in sleep from her dreams and besides she is young woman and not so long married there may be other things to think of some time if not now you tell me she has wrote all then she must consult with us but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work and we go alone i agreed heartily with him and then i told him what we had found in his absence that the house which dracula had bought was the very next one to my own he was amazed and a great concern seemed to come on him oh that we had known it before he said for then we might have reached him in time to save poor lucy however the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards as you say we shall not think of that but go on our way to the end then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway before we went to prepare for dinner he said to mrs harker ,Dracula
dr van helsing will you read this and tell me if it must go in it is my record of today i too have seen the need of putting down at present everything however trivial but there is little in this except what is personal must it go in the professor read it over gravely and handed it back saying ,Dracula
it need not go in if you do not wish it but i pray that it may it can but make your husband love you the more and all us your friends more honour youas well as more esteem and love she took it back with another blush and a bright smile ,Dracula
and so now up to this very hour all the records we have are complete and in order the professor took away one copy to study after dinner and before our meeting which is fixed for nine oclock the rest of us have already read everything so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy ,Dracula
 septemberwhen we met in dr sewards study two hours after dinner which had been at six oclock we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee professor van helsing took the head of the table to which dr seward motioned him as he came into the room he made me sit next to him on his right and asked me to act as secretary jonathan sat next to me opposite us were lord godalming dr seward and mr morrislord godalming being next the professor and dr seward in the centre the professor said ,Dracula
then it were i think good that i tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal i shall then make known to you something of the history of this man which has been ascertained for me so we then can discuss how we shall act and can take our measure according ,Dracula
there are such beings as vampires some of us have evidence that they exist even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience the teachings and the records of the past give proof enough for sane peoples i admit that at the first i was sceptic were it not that through long years i have train myself to keep an open mind i could not have believe until such time as that fact thunder on my ear see see i prove i prove alas had i known at the first what now i knownay had i even guess at himone so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her but that is gone and we must so work that other poor souls perish not whilst we can save the nosferatu do not die like the bee when he sting once he is only stronger and being stronger have yet more power to work evil this vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men he is of cunning more than mortal for his cunning be the growth of ages he have still the aids of necromancy which is as his etymology imply the divination by the dead and all the dead that he can come nigh to are for him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil in callous and the heart of him is not he can within limitations appear at will when and where and in any of the forms that are to him he can within his range direct the elements the storm the fog the thunder he can command all the meaner things the rat and the owl and the batthe moth and the fox and the wolf he can grow and become small and he can at times vanish and come unknown how then are we to begin our strike to destroy him how shall we find his where and having found it how can we destroy my friends this is much it is a terrible task that we undertake and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder for if we fail in this our fight he must surely win and then where end we life is nothings i heed him not but to fail here is not mere life or death it is that we become as him that we henceforward become foul things of the night like himwithout heart or conscience preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best to us for ever are the gates of heaven shut for who shall open them to us again we go on for all time abhorred by all a blot on the face of gods sunshine an arrow in the side of him who died for man but we are face to face with duty and in such case must we shrink for me i say no but then i am old and life with his sunshine his fair places his song of birds his music and his love lie far behind you others are young some have seen sorrow but there are fair days yet in store what say you ,Dracula
whilst he was speaking jonathan had taken my hand i feared oh so much that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when i saw his hand stretch out but it was life to me to feel its touchso strong so selfreliant so resolute a brave mans hand can speak for itself it does not even need a womans love to hear its music ,Dracula
dr seward simply nodded the professor stood up and after laying his golden crucifix on the table held out his hand on either side i took his right hand and lord godalming his left jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to mr morris so as we all took hands our solemn compact was made i felt my heart icy cold but it did not even occur to me to draw back we resumed our places and dr van helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun it was to be taken as gravely and in as businesslike a way as any other transaction of life ,Dracula
well you know what we have to contend against but we too are not without strength we have on our side power of combinationa power denied to the vampire kind we have sources of science we are free to act and think and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally in fact so far as our powers extend they are unfettered and we are free to use them we have selfdevotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one these things are much ,Dracula
all we have to go upon are traditions and superstitions these do not at the first appear much when the matter is one of life and deathnay of more than either life or death yet must we be satisfied in the first place because we have to beno other means is at our controland secondly because after all these thingstradition and superstitionare everything does not the belief in vampires rest for othersthough not alas for uson them a year ago which of us would have received such a possibility in the midst of our scientific sceptical matteroffact nineteenth century we even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes take it then that the vampire and the belief in his limitations and his cure rest for the moment on the same base for let me tell you he is known everywhere that men have been in old greece in old rome he flourish in germany all over in france in india even in the chernosese and in china so far from us in all ways there even is he and the peoples fear him at this day he have follow the wake of the berserker icelander the devilbegotten hun the slav the saxon the magyar so far then we have all we may act upon and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience the vampire live on and cannot die by mere passing of the time he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living even more we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger that his vital faculties grow strenuous and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pabulum is plenty but he cannot flourish without this diet he eat not as others even friend jonathan who lived with him for weeks did never see him to eat never he throws no shadow he make in the mirror no reflect as again jonathan observe he has the strength of many of his handwitness again jonathan when he shut the door against the wolfs and when he help him from the diligence too he can transform himself to wolf as we gather from the ship arrival in whitby when he tear open the dog he can be as bat as madam mina saw him on the window at whitby and as friend john saw him fly from this so near house and as my friend quincey saw him at the window of miss lucy he can come in mist which he createthat noble ships captain proved him of this but from what we know the distance he can make this mist is limited and it can only be round himself he come on moonlight rays as elemental dustas again jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of dracula he become so smallwe ourselves saw miss lucy ere she was at peace slip through a hairbreadth space at the tomb door he can when once he find his way come out from anything or into anything no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with firesolder you call it he can see in the darkno small power this in a world which is one half shut from the light ah but hear me through he can do all these things yet he is not free nay he is even more prisoner than the slave of the galley than the madman in his cell he cannot go where he lists he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of natures lawswhy we know not he may not enter anywhere at the first unless there be some one of the household who bid him to come though afterwards he can come as he please his power ceases as does that of all evil things at the coming of the day only at certain times can he have limited freedom if he be not at the place whither he is bound he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset these things are we told and in this record of ours we have proof by inference thus whereas he can do as he will within his limit when he have his earthhome his coffinhome his hellhome the place unhallowed as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at whitby still at other time he can only change when the time come it is said too that he can only pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power as the garlic that we know of and as for things sacred as this symbol my crucifix that was amongst us even now when we resolve to them he is nothing but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect there are others too which i shall tell you of lest in our seeking we may need them the branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it a sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead and as for the stake through him we know already of its peace or the cutoff head that giveth rest we have seen it with our eyes ,Dracula
thus when we find the habitation of this manthatwas we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him if we obey what we know but he is clever i have asked my friend arminius of budapesth university to make his record and from all the means that are he tell me of what he has been he must indeed have been that voivode dracula who won his name against the turk over the great river on the very frontier of turkeyland if it be so then was he no common man for in that time and for centuries after he was spoken of as the cleverest and the most cunning as well as the bravest of the sons of the land beyond the forest that mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave and are even now arrayed against us the draculas were says arminius a great and noble race though now and again were scions who were held by their coevals to have had dealings with the evil one they learned his secrets in the scholomance amongst the mountains over lake hermanstadt where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due in the records are such words as stregoicawitch ordog and pokolsatan and hell and in one manuscript this very dracula is spoken of as wampyr which we all understand too well there have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women and their graves make sacred the earth where alone this foulness can dwell for it is not the least of its terrors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good in soil barren of holy memories it cannot rest ,Dracula
and now we must settle what we do we have here much data and we must proceed to lay out our campaign we know from the inquiry of jonathan that from the castle to whitby came fifty boxes of earth all of which were delivered at carfax we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed it seems to me that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look today or whether any more have been removed if the latter we must trace ,Dracula
here we were interrupted in a very startling way outside the house came the sound of a pistolshot the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet which ricochetting from the top of the embrasure struck the far wall of the room i am afraid i am at heart a coward for i shrieked out the men all jumped to their feet lord godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash as he did so we heard mr morriss voice without ,Dracula
it was an idiotic thing of me to do and i ask your pardon mrs harker most sincerely i fear i must have frightened you terribly but the fact is that whilst the professor was talking there came a big bat and sat on the windowsill i have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that i cannot stand them and i went out to have a shot as i have been doing of late of evenings whenever i have seen one you used to laugh at me for it then art ,Dracula
we must trace each of these boxes and when we are ready we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must so to speak sterilise the earth so that no more he can seek safety in it thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noon and sunset and so engage with him when he is at his most weak ,Dracula
and now for you madam mina this night is the end until all be well you are too precious to us to have such risk when we part tonight you no more must question we shall tell you all in good time we are men and are able to bear but you must be our star and our hope and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger such as we are ,Dracula
all the men even jonathan seemed relieved but it did not seem to me good that they should brave danger and perhaps lessen their safetystrength being the best safetythrough care of me but their minds were made up and though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow i could say nothing save to accept their chivalrous care of me ,Dracula
i own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close but i did not say anything for i had a greater fear that if i appeared as a drag or a hindrance to their work they might even leave me out of their counsels altogether they have now gone off to carfax with means to get into the house ,Dracula
 october  a mjust as we were about to leave the house an urgent message was brought to me from renfield to know if i would see him at once as he had something of the utmost importance to say to me i told the messenger to say that i would attend to his wishes in the morning i was busy just at the moment the attendant added ,Dracula
he seems very importunate sir i have never seen him so eager i dont know but what if you dont see him soon he will have one of his violent fits i knew the man would not have said this without some cause so i said all right ill go now and i asked the others to wait a few minutes for me as i had to go and see my patient ,Dracula
take me with you friend john said the professor his case in your diary interest me much and it had bearing too now and again on our case i should much like to see him and especial when his mind is disturbed ,Dracula
we found him in a state of considerable excitement but far more rational in his speech and manner than i had ever seen him there was an unusual understanding of himself which was unlike anything i had ever met with in a lunatic and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely sane we all four went into the room but none of the others at first said anything his request was that i would at once release him from the asylum and send him home this he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery and adduced his own existing sanity i appeal to your friends he said they will perhaps not mind sitting in judgment on my case by the way you have not introduced me i was so much astonished that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment and besides there was a certain dignity in the mans manner so much of the habit of equality that i at once made the introduction lord godalming professor van helsing mr quincey morris of texas mr renfield he shook hands with each of them saying in turn ,Dracula
lord godalming i had the honour of seconding your father at the windham i grieve to know by your holding the title that he is no more he was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him and in his youth was i have heard the inventor of a burnt rum punch much patronised on derby night mr morris you should be proud of your great state its reception into the union was a precedent which may have farreaching effects hereafter when the pole and the tropics may hold alliance to the stars and stripes the power of treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement when the monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political fable what shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting van helsing sir i make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix when an individual has revolutionised therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brainmatter conventional forms are unfitting since they would seem to limit him to one of a class you gentlemen who by nationality by heredity or by the possession of natural gifts are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world i take to witness that i am as sane as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties and i am sure that you dr seward humanitarian and medicojurist as well as scientist will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances he made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm ,Dracula
i think we were all staggered for my own part i was under the conviction despite my knowledge of the mans character and history that his reason had been restored and i felt under a strong impulse to tell him that i was satisfied as to his sanity and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning i thought it better to wait however before making so grave a statement for of old i knew the sudden changes to which this particular patient was liable so i contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly that i would have a longer chat with him in the morning and would then see what i could do in the direction of meeting his wishes this did not at all satisfy him for he said quickly ,Dracula
but i fear dr seward that you hardly apprehend my wish i desire to go at onceherenowthis very hourthis very moment if i may time presses and in our implied agreement with the old scytheman it is of the essence of the contract i am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as dr seward so simple yet so momentous a wish to ensure its fulfilment he looked at me keenly and seeing the negative in my face turned to the others and scrutinised them closely not meeting any sufficient response he went on ,Dracula
then i suppose i must only shift my ground of request let me ask for this concessionboon privilege what you will i am content to implore in such a case not on personal grounds but for the sake of others i am not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons but you may i assure you take it from me that they are good ones sound and unselfish and spring from the highest sense of duty could you look sir into my heart you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me nay more you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends again he looked at us all keenly i had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another form or phase of his madness and so determined to let him go on a little longer knowing from experience that he would like all lunatics give himself away in the end van helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look he said to renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time but only when i thought of it afterwardsfor it was as of one addressing an equal ,Dracula
can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight i will undertake that if you will satisfy even mea stranger without prejudice and with the habit of keeping an open minddr seward will give you at his own risk and on his own responsibility the privilege you seek he shook his head sadly and with a look of poignant regret on his face the professor went on ,Dracula
come sir bethink yourself you claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness you do this whose sanity we have reason to doubt since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect if you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us be wise and help us and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish he still shook his head as he said ,Dracula
dr van helsing i have nothing to say your argument is complete and if i were free to speak i should not hesitate a moment but i am not my own master in the matter i can only ask you to trust me if i am refused the responsibility does not rest with me i thought it was now time to end the scene which was becoming too comically grave so i went towards the door simply saying ,Dracula
as however i got near the door a new change came over the patient he moved towards me so quickly that for the moment i feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack my fears however were groundless for he held up his two hands imploringly and made his petition in a moving manner as he saw that the very excess of his emotion was militating against him by restoring us more to our old relations he became still more demonstrative i glanced at van helsing and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes so i became a little more fixed in my manner if not more stern and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing i had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much such for instance as when he wanted a cat and i was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion my expectation was not realised for when he found that his appeal would not be successful he got into quite a frantic condition he threw himself on his knees and held up his hands wringing them in plaintive supplication and poured forth a torrent of entreaty with the tears rolling down his cheeks and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion ,Dracula
let me entreat you dr seward oh let me implore you to let me out of this house at once send me away how you will and where you will send keepers with me with whips and chains let them take me in a straitwaistcoat manacled and legironed even to a gaol but let me go out of this you dont know what you do by keeping me here i am speaking from the depths of my heartof my very soul you dont know whom you wrong or how and i may not tell woe is me i may not tell by all you hold sacredby all you hold dearby your love that is lostby your hope that livesfor the sake of the almighty take me out of this and save my soul from guilt cant you hear me man cant you understand will you never learn dont you know that i am sane and earnest now that i am no lunatic in a mad fit but a sane man fighting for his soul oh hear me hear me let me go let me go let me go ,Dracula
he suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments then without a word he rose and moving over sat down on the side of the bed the collapse had come as on former occasion just as i had expected ,Dracula
 october  a mi went with the party to the search with an easy mind for i think i never saw mina so absolutely strong and well i am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men do the work somehow it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all but now that her work is done and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells she may well feel that her part is finished and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us we were i think all a little upset by the scene with mr renfield when we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study then mr morris said to dr seward ,Dracula
say jack if that man wasnt attempting a bluff he is about the sanest lunatic i ever saw im not sure but i believe that he had some serious purpose and if he had it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance lord godalming and i were silent but dr van helsing added ,Dracula
friend john you know more of lunatics than i do and im glad of it for i fear that if it had been to me to decide i would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free but we live and learn and in our present task we must take no chance as my friend quincey would say all is best as they are dr seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of way ,Dracula
i dont know but that i agree with you if that man had been an ordinary lunatic i would have taken my chance of trusting him but he seems so mixed up with the count in an indexy kind of way that i am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads i cant forget how he prayed with almost equal fervour for a cat and then tried to tear my throat out with his teeth besides he called the count lord and master and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way that horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him so i suppose he isnt above trying to use a respectable lunatic he certainly did seem earnest though i only hope we have done what is best these things in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand help to unnerve a man the professor stepped over and laying his hand on his shoulder said in his grave kindly way ,Dracula
friend john have no fear we are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case we can only do as we deem best what else have we to hope for except the pity of the good god lord godalming had slipped away for a few minutes but now he returned he held up a little silver whistle as he remarked ,Dracula
that old place may be full of rats and if so ive got an antidote on call having passed the wall we took our way to the house taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moonlight shone out when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things which he laid on the step sorting them into four little groups evidently one for each then he spoke ,Dracula
my friends we are going into a terrible danger and we need arms of many kinds our enemy is not merely spiritual remember that he has the strength of twenty men and that though our necks or our windpipes are of the common kindand therefore breakable or crushablehis are not amenable to mere strength a stronger man or a body of men more strong in all than him can at certain times hold him but they cannot hurt him as we can be hurt by him we must therefore guard ourselves from his touch keep this near your heartas he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me i being nearest to himput these flowers round your neckhere he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossomsfor other enemies more mundane this revolver and this knife and for aid in all these so small electric lamps which you can fasten to your breast and for all and above all at the last this which we must not desecrate needless this was a portion of sacred wafer which he put in an envelope and handed to me each of the others was similarly equipped now he said friend john where are the skeleton keys if so that we can open the door we need not break house by the window as before at miss lucys ,Dracula
dr seward tried one or two skeleton keys his mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead presently he got one to suit after a little play back and forward the bolt yielded and with a rusty clang shot back we pressed on the door the rusty hinges creaked and it slowly opened it was startlingly like the image conveyed to me in dr sewards diary of the opening of miss westenras tomb i fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others for with one accord they shrank back the professor was the first to move forward and stepped into the open door ,Dracula
in manus tuas domine he said crossing himself as he passed over the threshold we closed the door behind us lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road the professor carefully tried the lock lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit then we all lit our lamps and proceeded on our search ,Dracula
the light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms as the rays crossed each other or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows i could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was some one else amongst us i suppose it was the recollection so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings of that terrible experience in transylvania i think the feeling was common to us all for i noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow just as i felt myself doing ,Dracula
the whole place was thick with dust the floor was seemingly inches deep except where there were recent footsteps in which on holding down my lamp i could see marks of hobnails where the dust was cracked the walls were fluffy and heavy with dust and in the corners were masses of spiders webs whereon the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered rags as the weight had torn them partly down on a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys with a timeyellowed label on each they had been used several times for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust similar to that exposed when the professor lifted them he turned to me and said ,Dracula
you know this place jonathan you have copied maps of it and you know it at least more than we do which is the way to the chapel i had an idea of its direction though on my former visit i had not been able to get admission to it so i led the way and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite a low arched oaken door ribbed with iron bands this is the spot said the professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase with a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door we were prepared for some unpleasantness for as we were opening the door a faint malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered none of the others had met the count at all at close quarters and when i had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his rooms or when he was gloated with fresh blood in a ruined building open to the air but here the place was small and close and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul there was an earthy smell as of some dry miasma which came through the fouler air but as to the odour itself how shall i describe it it was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell of blood but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt faugh it sickens me to think of it every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsomeness ,Dracula
under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to an end but this was no ordinary case and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considerations after the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses ,Dracula
the first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we cannot get some clue as to what has become of the rest a glance was sufficient to show how many remained for the great earth chests were bulky and there was no mistaking them ,Dracula
there were only twentynine left out of the fifty once i got a fright for seeing lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond i looked too and for an instant my heart stood still somewhere looking out from the shadow i seemed to see the high lights of the counts evil face the ridge of the nose the red eyes the red lips the awful pallor it was only for a moment for as lord godalming said i thought i saw a face but it was only the shadows and resumed his inquiry i turned my lamp in the direction and stepped into the passage there was no sign of any one and as there were no corners no doors no aperture of any kind but only the solid walls of the passage there could be no hidingplace even for him i took it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing ,Dracula
a few minutes later i saw morris step suddenly back from a corner which he was examining we all followed his movements with our eyes for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence which twinkled like stars we all instinctively drew back the whole place was becoming alive with rats ,Dracula
for a moment or two we stood appalled all save lord godalming who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency rushing over to the great ironbound oaken door which dr seward had described from the outside and which i had seen myself he turned the key in the lock drew the huge bolts and swung the door open then taking his little silver whistle from his pocket he blew a low shrill call it was answered from behind dr sewards house by the yelping of dogs and after about a minute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house unconsciously we had all moved towards the door and as we moved i noticed that the dust had been much disturbed the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way but even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased they seemed to swarm over the place all at once till the lamplight shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering baleful eyes made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies the dogs dashed on but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled and then simultaneously lifting their noses began to howl in most lugubrious fashion the rats were multiplying in thousands and we moved out ,Dracula
lord godalming lifted one of the dogs and carrying him in placed him on the floor the instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage and rushed at his natural enemies they fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score the other dogs who had by now been lifted in the same manner had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished ,Dracula
with their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate foes and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes we all seemed to find our spirits rise whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open i know not but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution we closed the outer door and barred and locked it and bringing the dogs with us began our search of the house we found nothing throughout except dust in extraordinary proportions and all untouched save for my own footsteps when i had made my first visit never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbithunting in a summer wood ,Dracula
the morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front dr van helsing had taken the key of the halldoor from the bunch and locked the door in orthodox fashion putting the key into his pocket when he had done ,Dracula
so far he said our night has been eminently successful no harm has come to us such as i feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing more than all do i rejoice that this our firstand perhaps our most difficult and dangerousstep has been accomplished without the bringing thereinto our most sweet madam mina or troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget one lesson too we have learned if it be allowable to argue a particulari that the brute beasts which are to the counts command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power for look these rats that would come to his call just as from his castle top he summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mothers cry though they come to him they run pellmell from the so little dogs of my friend arthur we have other matters before us other dangers other fears and that monsterhe has not used his power over the brute world for the only or the last time tonight so be it that he has gone elsewhere good it has given us opportunity to cry check in some ways in this chess game which we play for the stake of human souls and now let us go home the dawn is close at hand and we have reason to be content with our first nights work it may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow if full of peril but we must go on and from no danger shall we shrink ,Dracula
the house was silent when we got back save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards and a low moaning sound from renfields room the poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself after the manner of the insane with needless thoughts of pain ,Dracula
i came tiptoe into our own room and found mina asleep breathing so softly that i had to put my ear down to hear it she looks paler than usual i hope the meeting tonight has not upset her i am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work and even of our deliberations it is too great a strain for a woman to bear i did not think so at first but i know better now therefore i am glad that it is settled there may be things which would frighten her to hear and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished and the earth free from a monster of the nether world i daresay it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours but i must be resolute and tomorrow i shall keep dark over tonights doings and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened i rest on the sofa so as not to disturb her ,Dracula
 october lateri suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves for the day was a busy one and the night had no rest at all even mina must have felt its exhaustion for though i slept till the sun was high i was awake before her and had to call two or three times before she awoke indeed she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me but looked at me with a sort of blank terror as one looks who has been waked out of a bad dream she complained a little of being tired and i let her rest till later in the day we now know of twentyone boxes having been removed and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace them all such will of course immensely simplify our labour and the sooner the matter is attended to the better i shall look up thomas snelling today ,Dracula
 octoberit was towards noon when i was awakened by the professor walking into my room he was more jolly and cheerful than usual and it is quite evident that last nights work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind after going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said ,Dracula
your patient interests me much may it be that with you i visit him this morning or if that you are too occupy i can go alone if it may be it is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy and reason so sound i had some work to do which pressed so i told him that if he would go alone i would be glad as then i should not have to keep him waiting so i called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions before the professor left the room i cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient but he answered i want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things he said to madam mina as i see in your diary of yesterday that he had once had such a belief why do you smile friend john ,Dracula
excuse me i said but the answer is here i laid my hand on the typewritten matter when our sane and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before mrs harker entered the room van helsing smiled in turn good he said your memory is true friend john i should have remembered and yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than i shall from the teaching of the most wise who knows i went on with my work and before long was through that in hand it seemed that the time had been very short indeed but there was van helsing back in the study do i interrupt he asked politely as he stood at the door ,Dracula
i fear that he does not appraise me at much our interview was short when i entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre with his elbows on his knees and his face was the picture of sullen discontent i spoke to him as cheerfully as i could and with such a measure of respect as i could assume he made no reply whatever dont you know me i asked his answer was not reassuring i know you well enough you are the old fool van helsing i wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else damn all thickheaded dutchmen not a word more would he say but sat in his implacable sullenness as indifferent to me as though i had not been in the room at all thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic so i shall go if i may and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul madam mina friend john it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained no more to be worried with our terrible things though we shall much miss her help it is better so ,Dracula
i agree with you with all my heart i answered earnestly for i did not want him to weaken in this matter mrs harker is better out of it things are quite bad enough for us all men of the world and who have been in many tight places in our time but it is no place for a woman and if she had remained in touch with the affair it would in time infallibly have wrecked her ,Dracula
 octoberit is strange to me to be kept in the dark as i am today after jonathans full confidence for so many years to see him manifestly avoid certain matters and those the most vital of all this morning i slept late after the fatigues of yesterday and though jonathan was late too he was the earlier he spoke to me before he went out never more sweetly or tenderly but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the counts house and yet he must have known how terribly anxious i was poor dear fellow i suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me they all agreed that it was best that i should not be drawn further into this awful work and i acquiesced but to think that he keeps anything from me and now i am crying like a silly fool when i know it comes from my husbands great love and from the good good wishes of those other strong men ,Dracula
that has done me good well some day jonathan will tell me all and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that i kept anything from him i still keep my journal as usual then if he has feared of my trust i shall show it to him with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read i feel strangely sad and lowspirited today i suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement ,Dracula
last night i went to bed when the men had gone simply because they told me to i didnt feel sleepy and i did feel full of devouring anxiety i kept thinking over everything that has been ever since jonathan came to see me in london and it all seems like a horrible tragedy with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end everything that one does seems no matter how right it may be to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored if i hadnt gone to whitby perhaps poor dear lucy would be with us now she hadnt taken to visiting the churchyard till i came and if she hadnt come there in the daytime with me she wouldnt have walked there in her sleep and if she hadnt gone there at night and asleep that monster couldnt have destroyed her as he did oh why did i ever go to whitby there now crying again i wonder what has come over me today i must hide it from jonathan for if he knew that i had been crying twice in one morningi who never cried on my own account and whom he has never caused to shed a tearthe dear fellow would fret his heart out i shall put a bold face on and if i do feel weepy he shall never see it i suppose it is one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn ,Dracula
i cant quite remember how i fell asleep last night i remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds like praying on a very tumultuous scale from mr renfields room which is somewhere under this and then there was silence over everything silence so profound that it startled me and i got up and looked out of the window all was dark and silent the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of their own not a thing seemed to be stirring but all to be grim and fixed as death or fate so that a thin streak of white mist that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own i think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good for when i got back to bed i found a lethargy creeping over me i lay a while but could not quite sleep so i got out and looked out of the window again the mist was spreading and was now close up to the house so that i could see it lying thick against the wall as though it were stealing up to the windows the poor man was more loud than ever and though i could not distinguish a word he said i could in some way recognise in his tones some passionate entreaty on his part then there was the sound of a struggle and i knew that the attendants were dealing with him i was so frightened that i crept into bed and pulled the clothes over my head putting my fingers in my ears i was not then a bit sleepy at least so i thought but i must have fallen asleep for except dreams i do not remember anything until the morning when jonathan woke me i think that it took me an effort and a little time to realise where i was and that it was jonathan who was bending over me my dream was very peculiar and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in or continued in dreams ,Dracula
i thought that i was asleep and waiting for jonathan to come back i was very anxious about him and i was powerless to act my feet and my hands and my brain were weighted so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace and so i slept uneasily and thought then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy and dank and cold i put back the clothes from my face and found to my surprise that all was dim around the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan but turned down came only like a tiny red spark through the fog which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room then it occurred to me that i had shut the window before i had come to bed i would have got out to make certain on the point but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will i lay still and endured that was all i closed my eyes but could still see through my eyelids it is wonderful what tricks our dreams play us and how conveniently we can imagine the mist grew thicker and thicker and i could see now how it came in for i could see it like smokeor with the white energy of boiling waterpouring in not through the window but through the joinings of the door it got thicker and thicker till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room through the top of which i could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room and through it all came the scriptural words a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night was it indeed some such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep but the pillar was composed of both the day and the nightguiding for the fire was in the red eye which at the thought got a new fascination for me till as i looked the fire divided and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes such as lucy told me of in her momentary mental wandering when on the cliff the dying sunlight struck the windows of st marys church suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight and in my dream i must have fainted for all became black darkness the last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist i must be careful of such dreams for they would unseat ones reason if there were too much of them i would get dr van helsing or dr seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep only that i fear to alarm them such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me tonight i shall strive hard to sleep naturally if i do not i shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral that cannot hurt me for once and it will give me a good nights sleep last night tired me more than if i had not slept at all ,Dracula
 october  p mlast night i slept but did not dream i must have slept soundly for i was not waked by jonathan coming to bed but the sleep has not refreshed me for today i feel terribly weak and spiritless i spent all yesterday trying to read or lying down dozing in the afternoon mr renfield asked if he might see me poor man he was very gentle and when i came away he kissed my hand and bade god bless me some way it affected me much i am crying when i think of him this is a new weakness of which i must be careful jonathan would be miserable if he knew i had been crying he and the others were out till dinnertime and they all came in tired i did what i could to brighten them up and i suppose that the effort did me good for i forgot how tired i was after dinner they sent me to bed and all went off to smoke together as they said but i knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day i could see from jonathans manner that he had something important to communicate i was not so sleepy as i should have been so before they went i asked dr seward to give me a little opiate of some kind as i had not slept well the night before he very kindly made me up a sleeping draught which he gave to me telling me that it would do me no harm as it was very mild i have taken it and am waiting for sleep which still keeps aloof i hope i have not done wrong for as sleep begins to flirt with me a new fear comes that i may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking i might want it here comes sleep goodnight ,Dracula
 october eveningi found thomas snelling in his house at bethnal green but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything the very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much and he had begun too early on his expected debauch i learned however from his wife who seemed a decent poor soul that he was only the assistant to smollet who of the two mates was the responsible person so off i drove to walworth and found mr joseph smollet at home and in his shirtsleeves taking a late tea out of a saucer he is a decent intelligent fellow distinctly a good reliable type of workman and with a headpiece of his own he remembered all about the incident of the boxes and from a wonderful dogseared notebook which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers and which had hieroglyphical entries in thick halfobliterated pencil he gave me the destinations of the boxes there were he said six in the cartload which he took from carfax and left at  chicksand street mile end new town and another six which he deposited at jamaica lane bermondsey if then the count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over london these places were chosen as the first of delivery so that later he might distribute more fully the systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of london he was now fixed on the far east of the northern shore on the east of the southern shore and on the south the north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical schemelet alone the city itself and the very heart of fashionable london in the southwest and west i went back to smollet and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from carfax ,Dracula
well guvnor youve treated me wery ansomei had given him half a sovereignan ill tell yer all i know i heard a man by the name of bloxam say four nights ago in the are an ounds in pinchers alley as ow he an his mate ad ad a rare dusty job in a old ouse at purfect there aint amany such jobs as this ere an im thinkin that maybe sam bloxam could tell ye summut i asked if he could tell me where to find him i told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another halfsovereign to him so he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up saying that he was going to begin the search then and there at the door he stopped and said ,Dracula
look ere guvnor there aint no sense in me akeepin you ere i may find sam soon or i maynt but anyhow he aint like to be in a way to tell ye much tonight sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze if you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it and put yer address on it ill find out where sam is to be found and post it ye tonight but yed better be up arter im soon in the mornin or maybe ye wont ketch im for sam gets off main early never mind the booze the night afore ,Dracula
this was all practical so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper and to keep the change when she came back i addressed the envelope and stamped it and when smollet had again faithfully promised to post the address when found i took my way to home were on the track anyhow i am tired tonight and want sleep mina is fast asleep and looks a little too pale her eyes look as though she had been crying poor dear ive no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others but it is best as it is it is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken the doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business i must be firm for on me this particular burden of silence must rest i shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances indeed it may not be a hard task after all for she herself has become reticent on the subject and has not spoken of the count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision ,Dracula
i got the letter in bed and rose without waking mina she looked heavy and sleepy and pale and far from well i determined not to wake her but that when i should return from this new search i would arrange for her going back to exeter i think she would be happier in our own home with her daily tasks to interest her than in being here amongst us and in ignorance i only saw dr seward for a moment and told him where i was off to promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as i should have found out anything i drove to walworth and found with some difficulty potters court mr smollets spelling misled me as i asked for poters court instead of potters court however when i had found the court i had no difficulty in discovering corcorans lodginghouse when i asked the man who came to the door for the depite he shook his head and said i dunno im there aint no such a person ere i never eard of im in all my bloomin days dont believe there aint nobody of that kind livin ere or anywheres i took out smollets letter and as i read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me what are you i asked ,Dracula
im the depity he answered i saw at once that i was on the right track phonetic spelling had again misled me a halfcrown tip put the deputys knowledge at my disposal and i learned that mr bloxam who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at corcorans had left for his work at poplar at five oclock that morning he could not tell me where the place of work was situated but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a newfangled wareus and with this slender clue i had to start for poplar it was twelve oclock before i got any satisfactory hint of such a building and this i got at a coffeeshop where some workmen were having their dinner one of these suggested that there was being erected at cross angel street a new cold storage building and as this suited the condition of a newfangled wareus i at once drove to it an interview with a surly gatekeeper and a surlier foreman both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm put me on the track of bloxam he was sent for on my suggesting that i was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter he was a smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bearing when i had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest he told me that he had made two journeys between carfax and a house in piccadilly and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxesmain heavy oneswith a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose i asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in piccadilly to which he replied ,Dracula
well guvnor i forgits the number but it was only a few doors from a big white church or somethink of the kind not long built it was a dusty old ouse too though nothin to the dustiness of the ouse we tooked the bloomin boxes from ,Dracula
there was the old party what engaged me awaitin in the ouse at purfleet he elped me to lift the boxes and put them in the dray curse me but he was the strongest chap i ever struck an him a old feller with a white moustache one that thin you would think he couldnt throw a shadder ,Dracula
no sir but ye neednt have no difficulty about that its a igh un with a stone front with a bow on it an igh steps up to the door i know them steps avin ad to carry the boxes up with three loafers what come round to earn a copper the old gent give them shillins an they seein they got so much they wanted more but e took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw im down the steps till the lot of them went away cussin i thought that with this description i could find the house so having paid my friend for his information i started off for piccadilly i had gained a new painful experience the count could it was evident handle the earthboxes himself if so time was precious for now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution he could by choosing his own time complete the task unobserved at piccadilly circus i discharged my cab and walked westward beyond the junior constitutional i came across the house described and was satisfied that this was the next of the lairs arranged by dracula the house looked as though it had been long untenanted the windows were encrusted with dust and the shutters were up all the framework was black with time and from the iron the paint had mostly scaled away it was evident that up to lately there had been a large noticeboard in front of the balcony it had however been roughly torn away the uprights which had supported it still remaining behind the rails of the balcony i saw there were some loose boards whose raw edges looked white i would have given a good deal to have been able to see the noticeboard intact as it would perhaps have given some clue to the ownership of the house i remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of carfax and i could not but feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house ,Dracula
there was at present nothing to be learned from the piccadilly side and nothing could be done so i went round to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter the mews were active the piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation i asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom i saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house one of them said that he heard it had lately been taken but he couldnt say from whom he told me however that up to very lately there had been a noticeboard of for sale up and that perhaps mitchell sons  candy the house agents could tell me something as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board i did not wish to seem too eager or to let my informant know or guess too much so thanking him in the usual manner i strolled away it was now growing dusk and the autumn night was closing in so i did not lose any time having learned the address of mitchell sons  candy from a directory at the berkeley i was soon at their office in sackville street ,Dracula
the gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner but uncommunicative in equal proportion having once told me that the piccadilly housewhich throughout our interview he called a mansionwas sold he considered my business as concluded when i asked who had purchased it he opened his eyes a thought wider and paused a few seconds before replying ,Dracula
but i do mind he answered the affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of mitchell sons  candy this was manifestly a prig of the first water and there was no use arguing with him i thought i had best meet him on his own ground so i said ,Dracula
your clients sir are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence i am myself a professional man here i handed him my card in this instance i am not prompted by curiosity i act on the part of lord godalming who wishes to know something of the property which was he understood lately for sale these words put a different complexion on affairs he said ,Dracula
i would like to oblige you if i could mr harker and especially would i like to oblige his lordship we once carried out a small matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the honourable arthur holmwood if you will let me have his lordships address i will consult the house on the subject and will in any case communicate with his lordship by tonights post it will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship ,Dracula
i wanted to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so i thanked him gave the address at dr sewards and came away it was now dark and i was tired and hungry i got a cup of tea at the arated bread company and came down to purfleet by the next train ,Dracula
i found all the others at home mina was looking tired and pale but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful it wrung my heart to think that i had had to keep anything from her and so caused her inquietude thank god this will be the last night of her looking on at our conferences and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence it took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our grim task she seems somehow more reconciled or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders i am glad we made our resolution in time as with such a feeling as this our growing knowledge would be torture to her ,Dracula
i could not tell the others of the days discovery till we were alone so after dinnerfollowed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselvesi took mina to her room and left her to go to bed the dear girl was more affectionate with me than ever and clung to me as though she would detain me but there was much to be talked of and i came away thank god the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us ,Dracula
when i came down again i found the others all gathered round the fire in the study in the train i had written my diary so far and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information when i had finished van helsing said ,Dracula
this has been a great days work friend jonathan doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes if we find them all in that house then our work is near the end but if there be some missing we must search until we find them then shall we make our final coup and hunt the wretch to his real death we all sat silent awhile and all at once mr morris spoke ,Dracula
but art this is different we broke house at carfax but we had night and a walled park to protect us it will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in piccadilly either by day or night i confess i dont see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort perhaps we shall know when you get his letter in the morning lord godalmings brows contracted and he stood up and walked about the room byandby he stopped and said turning from one to another of us ,Dracula
as nothing could well be done before morning and as it would be at least advisable to wait till lord godalming should hear from mitchells we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time for a good while we sat and smoked discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings i took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment i am very sleepy and shall go to bed ,Dracula
just a line mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles as though she thinks even in her sleep she is still too pale but does not look so haggard as she did this morning tomorrow will i hope mend all this she will be herself at home in exeter oh but i am sleepy ,Dracula
 octoberi am puzzled afresh about renfield his moods change so rapidly that i find it difficult to keep touch of them and as they always mean something more than his own wellbeing they form a more than interesting study this morning when i went to see him after his repulse of van helsing his manner was that of a man commanding destiny he was in fact commanding destinysubjectively he did not really care for any of the things of mere earth he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals i thought i would improve the occasion and learn something so i asked him ,Dracula
oh no oh no i want no souls life is all i want here he brightened up i am pretty indifferent about it at present life is all right i have all i want you must get a new patient doctor if you wish to study zophagy ,Dracula
oh no far be it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the deity i am not even concerned in his especially spiritual doings if i may state my intellectual position i am so far as concerns things purely terrestrial somewhat in the position which enoch occupied spiritually this was a poser to me i could not at the moment recall enochs appositeness so i had to ask a simple question though i felt that by so doing i was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic ,Dracula
so you dont care about life and you dont want souls why not i put my question quickly and somewhat sternly on purpose to disconcert him the effort succeeded for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner bent low before me and actually fawned upon me as he replied ,Dracula
i dont want any souls indeed indeed i dont i couldnt use them if i had them they would be no manner of use to me i couldnt eat them or he suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face like a windsweep on the surface of the water and doctor as to life what is it after all when youve got all you require and you know that you will never want that is all i have friendsgood friendslike you dr seward this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning i know that i shall never lack the means of life ,Dracula
i think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me for he at once fell back on the last refuge of such as hea dogged silence after a short time i saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him he was sulky and so i came away ,Dracula
later in the day he sent for me ordinarily i would not have come without special reason but just at present i am so interested in him that i would gladly make an effort besides i am glad to have anything to help to pass the time harker is out following up clues and so are lord godalming and quincey van helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the harkers he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue he does not wish to be disturbed in the work without cause i would have taken him with me to see the patient only i thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again there was also another reason renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and i were alone ,Dracula
i found him sitting out in the middle of the floor on his stool a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part when i came in he said at once as though the question had been waiting on his lips ,Dracula
what about souls it was evident then that my surmise had been correct unconscious cerebration was doing its work even with the lunatic i determined to have the matter out what about them yourself i asked he did not reply for a moment but looked all round him and up and down as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer ,Dracula
a nice time youll have some time when youre flying out there with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and miauing all round you youve got their lives you know and you must put up with their souls something seemed to affect his imagination for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes screwing them up tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being soaped there was something pathetic in it that touched me it also gave me a lesson for it seemed that before me was a childonly a child though the features were worn and the stubble on the jaws was white it was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance and knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself i thought i would enter into his mind as well as i could and go with him the first step was to restore confidence so i asked him speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears ,Dracula
so so i thought to myself this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word drink what does it mean renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse for he hurried on as though to distract my attention from it ,Dracula
i dont take any stock at all in such matters rats and mice and such small deer as shakespeare has it chickenfeed of the larder they might be called im past all that sort of nonsense you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks as to try to interest me about the lesser carnivora when i know of what is before me ,Dracula
i dont want an elephants soul or any soul at all he said for a few moments he sat despondently suddenly he jumped to his feet with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement to hell with you and your souls he shouted why do you plague me about souls havent i got enough to worry and pain and distract me already without thinking of souls he looked so hostile that i thought he was in for another homicidal fit so i blew my whistle the instant however that i did so he became calm and said apologetically ,Dracula
forgive me doctor i forgot myself you do not need any help i am so worried in my mind that i am apt to be irritable if you only knew the problem i have to face and that i am working out you would pity and tolerate and pardon me pray do not put me in a straitwaistcoat i want to think and i cannot think freely when my body is confined i am sure you will understand he had evidently selfcontrol so when the attendants came i told them not to mind and they withdrew renfield watched them go when the door was closed he said with considerable dignity and sweetness ,Dracula
dr seward you have been very considerate towards me believe me that i am very very grateful to you i thought it well to leave him in this mood and so i came away there is certainly something to ponder over in this mans state several points seem to make what the american interviewer calls a story if one could only get them in proper order here they are ,Dracula
lateri went after my round to van helsing and told him my suspicion he grew very grave and after thinking the matter over for a while asked me to take him to renfield i did so as we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago when we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old the flies lethargic with the autumn were beginning to buzz into the room we tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation but he would not attend he went on with his singing just as though we had not been present he had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a notebook we had to come away as ignorant as we went in ,Dracula
we are at all times only too happy to meet your wishes we beg with regard to the desire of your lordship expressed by mr harker on your behalf to supply the following information concerning the sale and purchase of no  piccadilly the original vendors are the executors of the late mr archibald wintersuffield the purchaser is a foreign nobleman count de ville who effected the purchase himself paying the purchase money in notes over the counter if your lordship will pardon us using so vulgar an expression beyond this we know nothing whatever of him ,Dracula
 octoberi placed a man in the corridor last night and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from renfields room and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me after dinner when we had all gathered round the fire in the studymrs harker having gone to bedwe discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day harker was the only one who had any result and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one ,Dracula
this morning the man on duty reported to me that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly i asked him if that was all he replied that it was all he heard there was something about his manner so suspicious that i asked him point blank if he had been asleep he denied sleep but admitted to having dozed for a while it is too bad that men cannot be trusted unless they are watched ,Dracula
today harker is out following up his clue and art and quincey are looking after horses godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose we must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset we shall thus catch the count at his weakest and without a refuge to fly to van helsing is off to the british museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine the old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept and the professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later ,Dracula
laterwe have met again we seem at last to be on the track and our work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end i wonder if renfields quiet has anything to do with this his moods have so followed the doings of the count that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him in some subtle way if we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind between the time of my argument with him today and his resumption of flycatching it might afford us a valuable clue he is now seemingly quiet for a spell is he that wild yell seemed to come from his room ,Dracula
the attendant came bursting into my room and told me that renfield had somehow met with some accident he had heard him yell and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor all covered with blood i must go at once ,Dracula
when i came to renfields room i found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood when i went to move him it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries there seemed none of that unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity as the face was exposed i could see that it was horribly bruised as though it had been beaten against the floorindeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated the attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over ,Dracula
i think sir his back is broken see both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed how such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure he seemed quite bewildered and his brows were gathered in as he said ,Dracula
i cant understand the two things he could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor i saw a young woman do it once at the eversfield asylum before anyone could lay hands on her and i suppose he might have broke his neck by falling out of bed if he got in an awkward kink but for the life of me i cant imagine how the two things occurred if his back was broke he couldnt beat his head and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed there would be marks of it i said to him ,Dracula
go to dr van helsing and ask him to kindly come here at once i want him without an instants delay the man ran off and within a few minutes the professor in his dressing gown and slippers appeared when he saw renfield on the ground he looked keenly at him a moment and then turned to me i think he recognised my thought in my eyes for he said very quietly manifestly for the ears of the attendant ,Dracula
the patient was now breathing stertorously and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury van helsing returned with extraordinary celerity bearing with him a surgical case he had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up for almost before he looked at the patient he whispered to me ,Dracula
the man withdrew and we went into a strict examination of the patient the wounds of the face was superficial the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull extending right up through the motor area the professor thought a moment and said ,Dracula
we must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions as far as can be the rapidity of the suffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury the whole motor area seems affected the suffusion of the brain will increase quickly so we must trephine at once or it may be too late as he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door i went over and opened it and found in the corridor without arthur and quincey in pajamas and slippers the former spoke ,Dracula
i heard your man call up dr van helsing and tell him of an accident so i woke quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times ive been thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as they have been well have to look backand forward a little more than we have done may we come in i nodded and held the door open till they had entered then i closed it again when quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient and noted the horrible pool on the floor he said softly ,Dracula
my god what has happened to him poor poor devil i told him briefly and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operationfor a short time at all events he went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed with godalming beside him we all watched in patience ,Dracula
the minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness i had a horrible sinking in my heart and from van helsings face i gathered that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come i dreaded the words that renfield might speak i was positively afraid to think but the conviction of what was coming was on me as i have read of men who have heard the deathwatch the poor mans breathing came in uncertain gasps each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak but then would follow a prolonged stertorous breath and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility inured as i was to sick beds and death this suspense grew and grew upon me i could almost hear the beating of my own heart and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer the silence finally became agonising i looked at my companions one after another and saw from their flushed faces and damp brows that they were enduring equal torture there was a nervous suspense over us all as though overhead some dread bell would peal out powerfully when we should least expect it ,Dracula
at last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast he might die at any moment i looked up at the professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine his face was sternly set as he spoke ,Dracula
without another word he made the operation for a few moments the breathing continued to be stertorous then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest suddenly his eyes opened and became fixed in a wild helpless stare this was continued for a few moments then it softened into a glad surprise and from the lips came a sigh of relief he moved convulsively and as he did so said ,Dracula
ill be quiet doctor tell them to take off the straitwaistcoat i have had a terrible dream and it has left me so weak that i cannot move whats wrong with my face it feels all swollen and it smarts dreadfully he tried to turn his head but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so i gently put it back then van helsing said in a quiet grave tone ,Dracula
that is dr van helsing how good it is of you to be here give me some water my lips are dry and i shall try to tell you i dreamedhe stopped and seemed fainting i called quietly to quinceythe brandyit is in my studyquick he flew and returned with a glass the decanter of brandy and a carafe of water we moistened the parched lips and the patient quickly revived it seemed however that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval for when he was quite conscious he looked at me piercingly with an agonised confusion which i shall never forget and said ,Dracula
if i were not sure already i would know from them for an instant his eyes closednot with pain or sleep but voluntarily as though he were bringing all his faculties to bear when he opened them he said hurriedly and with more energy than he had yet displayed ,Dracula
quick doctor quick i am dying i feel that i have but a few minutes and then i must go back to deathor worse wet my lips with brandy again i have something that i must say before i die or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow thank you it was that night after you left me when i implored you to let me go away i couldnt speak then for i felt my tongue was tied but i was as sane then except in that way as i am now i was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me it seemed hours then there came a sudden peace to me my brain seemed to become cool again and i realised where i was i heard the dogs bark behind our house but not where he was as he spoke van helsings eyes never blinked but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard he did not however betray himself he nodded slightly and said go on in a low voice renfield proceeded ,Dracula
he came up to the window in the mist as i had seen him often before but he was solid thennot a ghost and his eyes were fierce like a mans when angry he was laughing with his red mouth the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees to where the dogs were barking i wouldnt ask him to come in at first though i knew he wanted tojust as he had wanted all along then he began promising me thingsnot in words but by doing them he was interrupted by a word from the professor ,Dracula
by making them happen just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings and big moths in the night with skull and crossbones on their backs van helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously ,Dracula
then he began to whisper rats rats rats hundreds thousands millions of them and every one a life and dogs to eat them and cats too all lives all red blood with years of life in it and not merely buzzing flies i laughed at him for i wanted to see what he could do then the dogs howled away beyond the dark trees in his house he beckoned me to the window i got up and looked out and he raised his hands and seemed to call out without using any words a dark mass spread over the grass coming on like the shape of a flame of fire and then he moved the mist to the right and left and i could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing redlike his only smaller he held up his hand and they all stopped and i thought he seemed to be saying all these lives will i give you ay and many more and greater through countless ages if you will fall down and worship me and then a red cloud like the colour of blood seemed to close over my eyes and before i knew what i was doing i found myself opening the sash and saying to him come in lord and master the rats were all gone but he slid into the room through the sash though it was only open an inch widejust as the moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour ,Dracula
his voice was weaker so i moistened his lips with the brandy again and he continued but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced i was about to call him back to the point but van helsing whispered to me let him go on do not interrupt him he cannot go back and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought he proceeded ,Dracula
all day i waited to hear from him but he did not send me anything not even a blowfly and when the moon got up i was pretty angry with him when he slid in through the window though it was shut and did not even knock i got mad with him he sneered at me and his white face looked out of the mist with his red eyes gleaming and he went on as though he owned the whole place and i was no one he didnt even smell the same as he went by me i couldnt hold him i thought that somehow mrs harker had come into the room ,Dracula
the two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over standing behind him so that he could not see them but where they could hear better they were both silent but the professor started and quivered his face however grew grimmer and sterner still renfield went on without noticing ,Dracula
i didnt know that she was here till she spoke and she didnt look the same i dont care for the pale people i like them with lots of blood in them and hers had all seemed to have run out i didnt think of it at the time but when she went away i began to think and it made me mad to know that he had been taking the life out of her i could feel that the rest quivered as i did but we remained otherwise still so when he came tonight i was ready for him i saw the mist stealing in and i grabbed it tight i had heard that madmen have unnatural strength and as i knew i was a madmanat times anyhowi resolved to use my power ay and he felt it too for he had to come out of the mist to struggle with me i held tight and i thought i was going to win for i didnt mean him to take any more of her life till i saw his eyes they burned into me and my strength became like water he slipped through it and when i tried to cling to him he raised me up and flung me down there was a red cloud before me and a noise like thunder and the mist seemed to steal away under the door his voice was becoming fainter and his breath more stertorous van helsing stood up instinctively ,Dracula
we know the worst now he said he is here and we know his purpose it may not be too late let us be armedthe same as we were the other night but lose no time there is not an instant to spare there was no need to put our fear nay our conviction into wordswe shared them in common we all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the counts house the professor had his ready and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said ,Dracula
they never leave me and they shall not till this unhappy business is over be wise also my friends it is no common enemy that we deal with alas alas that that dear madam mina should suffer he stopped his voice was breaking and i do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart ,Dracula
van helsing said solemnly you are always right but this is life and death all chambers are alike to the doctor and even were they not they are all as one to me tonight friend john when i turn the handle if the door does not open do you put your shoulder down and shove and you too my friends now ,Dracula
he turned the handle as he spoke but the door did not yield we threw ourselves against it with a crash it burst open and we almost fell headlong into the room the professor did actually fall and i saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees what i saw appalled me i felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck and my heart seemed to stand still ,Dracula
the moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see on the bed beside the window lay jonathan harker his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outwards was the whiteclad figure of his wife by her side stood a tall thin man clad in black his face was turned from us but the instant we saw we all recognised the countin every way even to the scar on his forehead with his left hand he held both mrs harkers hands keeping them away with her arms at full tension his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck forcing her face down on his bosom her white nightdress was smeared with blood and a thin stream trickled down the mans bare breast which was shown by his tornopen dress the attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kittens nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink as we burst into the room the count turned his face and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leap into it his eyes flamed red with devilish passion the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge and the white sharp teeth behind the full lips of the blooddripping mouth champed together like those of a wild beast with a wrench which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height he turned and sprang at us but by this time the professor had gained his feet and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacred wafer the count suddenly stopped just as poor lucy had done outside the tomb and cowered back further and further back he cowered as we lifting our crucifixes advanced the moonlight suddenly failed as a great black cloud sailed across the sky and when the gaslight sprang up under quinceys match we saw nothing but a faint vapour this as we looked trailed under the door which with the recoil from its bursting open had swung back to its old position van helsing art and i moved forward to mrs harker who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild so earpiercing so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day for a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray her face was ghastly with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood her eyes were mad with terror then she put before her face her poor crushed hands which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the counts terrible grip and from behind them came a low desolate wail which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief van helsing stepped forward and drew the coverlet gently over her body whilst art after looking at her face for an instant despairingly ran out of the room van helsing whispered to me ,Dracula
jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the vampire can produce we can do nothing with poor madam mina for a few moments till she recovers herself i must wake him he dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to flick him on the face his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heartbreaking to hear i raised the blind and looked out of the window there was much moonshine and as i looked i could see quincey morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yewtree it puzzled me to think why he was doing this but at the instant i heard harkers quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness and turned to the bed on his face as there might well be was a look of wild amazement he seemed dazed for a few seconds and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once and he started up his wife was aroused by the quick movement and turned to him with her arms stretched out as though to embrace him instantly however she drew them in again and putting her elbows together held her hands before her face and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook ,Dracula
in gods name what does this mean harker cried out dr seward dr van helsing what is it what has happened what is wrong mina dear what is it what does that blood mean my god my god has it come to this and raising himself to his knees he beat his hands wildly together good god help us help her oh help her with a quick movement he jumped from bed and began to pull on his clothesall the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion what has happened tell me all about it he cried without pausing dr van helsing you love mina i know oh do something to save her it cannot have gone too far yet guard her while i look for him his wife through her terror and horror and distress saw some sure danger to him instantly forgetting her own grief she seized hold of him and cried out ,Dracula
no no jonathan you must not leave me i have suffered enough tonight god knows without the dread of his harming you you must stay with me stay with these friends who will watch over you her expression became frantic as she spoke and he yielding to her she pulled him down sitting on the bed side and clung to him fiercely ,Dracula
do not fear my dear we are here and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach you are safe for tonight and we must be calm and take counsel together she shuddered and was silent holding down her head on her husbands breast when she raised it his white nightrobe was stained with blood where her lips had touched and where the thin open wound in her neck had sent forth drops the instant she saw it she drew back with a low wail and whispered amidst choking sobs ,Dracula
nonsense mina it is a shame to me to hear such a word i would not hear it of you and i shall not hear it from you may god judge me by my deserts and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour if by any act or will of mine anything ever come between us he put out his arms and folded her to his breast and for a while she lay there sobbing he looked at us over her bowed head with eyes that blinked damply above his quivering nostrils his mouth was set as steel after a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint and then he said to me speaking with a studied calmness which i felt tried his nervous power to the utmost ,Dracula
and now dr seward tell me all about it too well i know the broad fact tell me all that has been i told him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming impassiveness but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed as i told how the ruthless hands of the count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position with her mouth to the open wound in his breast it interested me even at that moment to see that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair just as i had finished quincey and godalming knocked at the door they entered in obedience to our summons van helsing looked at me questioningly i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from each other and from themselves so on nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done to which lord godalming answered ,Dracula
i could not see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms i looked in the study but though he had been there he had gone he had however he stopped suddenly looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed van helsing said gravely ,Dracula
he had been there and though it could only have been for a few seconds he made rare hay of the place all the manuscript had been burned and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire and the wax had helped the flames here i interrupted thank god there is the other copy in the safe his face lit for a moment but fell again as he went on i ran downstairs then but could see no sign of him i looked into renfields room but there was no trace there except again he paused go on said harker hoarsely so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue added except that the poor fellow is dead mrs harker raised her head looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly ,Dracula
a little he answered it may be much eventually but at present i cant say i thought it well to know if possible where the count would go when he left the house i did not see him but i saw a bat rise from renfields window and flap westward i expected to see him in some shape go back to carfax but he evidently sought some other lair he will not be back tonight for the sky is reddening in the east and the dawn is close we must work tomorrow ,Dracula
he said the latter words through his shut teeth for a space of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence and i could fancy that i could hear the sound of our hearts beating then van helsing said placing his hand very tenderly on mrs harkers head ,Dracula
and now madam minapoor dear dear madam minatell us exactly what happened god knows that i do not want that you be pained but it is need that we know all for now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp and in deadly earnest the day is close to us that must end all if it may be so and now is the chance that we may live and learn ,Dracula
the poor dear lady shivered and i could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast then she raised her head proudly and held out one hand to van helsing who took it in his and after stooping and kissing it reverently held it fast the other hand was locked in that of her husband who held his other arm thrown round her protectingly after a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts she began ,Dracula
i took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me but for a long time it did not act i seemed to become more wakeful and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mindall of them connected with death and vampires with blood and pain and trouble her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly do not fret dear you must be brave and strong and help me through the horrible task if you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all you would understand how much i need your help well i saw i must try to help the medicine to its work with my will if it was to do me any good so i resolutely set myself to sleep sure enough sleep must soon have come to me for i remember no more jonathan coming in had not waked me for he lay by my side when next i remember there was in the room the same thin white mist that i had before noticed but i forget now if you know of this you will find it in my diary which i shall show you later i felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence i turned to wake jonathan but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught and not i i tried but i could not wake him this caused me a great fear and i looked around terrified then indeed my heart sank within me beside the bed as if he had stepped out of the mistor rather as if the mist had turned into his figure for it had entirely disappearedstood a tall thin man all in black i knew him at once from the description of the others the waxen face the high aquiline nose on which the light fell in a thin white line the parted red lips with the sharp white teeth showing between and the red eyes that i had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of st marys church at whitby i knew too the red scar on his forehead where jonathan had struck him for an instant my heart stood still and i would have screamed out only that i was paralysed in the pause he spoke in a sort of keen cutting whisper pointing as he spoke to jonathan ,Dracula
silence if you make a sound i shall take him and dash his brains out before your very eyes i was appalled and was too bewildered to do or say anything with a mocking smile he placed one hand upon my shoulder and holding me tight bared my throat with the other saying as he did so first a little refreshment to reward my exertions you may as well be quiet it is not the first time or the second that your veins have appeased my thirst i was bewildered and strangely enough i did not want to hinder him i suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is when his touch is on his victim and oh my god my god pity me he placed his reeking lips upon my throat her husband groaned again she clasped his hand harder and looked at him pityingly as if he were the injured one and went on ,Dracula
i felt my strength fading away and i was in a half swoon how long this horrible thing lasted i know not but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul awful sneering mouth away i saw it drip with the fresh blood the remembrance seemed for a while to overpower her and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husbands sustaining arm with a great effort she recovered herself and went on ,Dracula
then he spoke to me mockingly and so you like the others would play your brains against mine you would help these men to hunt me and frustrate me in my designs you know now and they know in part already and will know in full before long what it is to cross my path they should have kept their energies for use closer to home whilst they played wits against meagainst me who commanded nations and intrigued for them and fought for them hundreds of years before they were borni was countermining them and you their best beloved one are now to me flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kin my bountiful winepress for a while and shall be later on my companion and my helper you shall be avenged in turn for not one of them but shall minister to your needs but as yet you are to be punished for what you have done you have aided in thwarting me now you shall come to my call when my brain says come to you you shall cross land or sea to do my bidding and to that end this with that he pulled open his shirt and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast when the blood began to spurt out he took my hands in one of his holding them tight and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the wound so that i must either suffocate or swallow some of the oh my god my god what have i done what have i done to deserve such a fate i who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days god pity me look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril and in mercy pity those to whom she is dear then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution ,Dracula
as she was telling her terrible story the eastern sky began to quicken and everything became more and more clear harker was still and quiet but over his face as the awful narrative went on came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light till when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair ,Dracula
 octoberas i must do something or go mad i write this diary it is now six oclock and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat for dr van helsing and dr seward are agreed that if we do not eat we cannot work our best our best will be god knows required today i must keep writing at every chance for i dare not stop to think all big and little must go down perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most the teaching big or little could not have landed mina or me anywhere worse than we are today however we must trust and hope poor mina told me just now with the tears running down her dear cheeks that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is testedthat we must keep on trusting and that god will aid us up to the end the end oh my god what end to work to work ,Dracula
when dr van helsing and dr seward had come back from seeing poor renfield we went gravely into what was to be done first dr seward told us that when he and dr van helsing had gone down to the room below they had found renfield lying on the floor all in a heap his face was all bruised and crushed in and the bones of the neck were broken ,Dracula
dr seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything he said that he had been sitting downhe confessed to half dozingwhen he heard loud voices in the room and then renfield had called out loudly several times god god god after that there was a sound of falling and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor face down just as the doctors had seen him van helsing asked if he had heard voices or a voice and he said he could not say that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one he could swear to it if required that the word god was spoken by the patient dr seward said to us when we were alone that he did not wish to go into the matter the question of an inquest had to be considered and it would never do to put forward the truth as no one would believe it as it was he thought that on the attendants evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed in case the coroner should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarily to the same result ,Dracula
when the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step the very first thing we decided was that mina should be in full confidence that nothing of any sortno matter how painfulshould be kept from her she herself agreed as to its wisdom and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful and in such a depth of despair there must be no concealment she said alas we have had too much already and besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than i have already enduredthan i suffer now whatever may happen it must be of new hope or of new courage to me van helsing was looking at her fixedly as she spoke and said suddenly but quietly ,Dracula
but dear madam mina are you not afraid not for yourself but for others from yourself after what has happened her face grew set in its lines but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered ,Dracula
i would if there were no friend who loved me who would save me such a pain and so desperate an effort she looked at him meaningly as she spoke he was sitting down but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly ,Dracula
my child there is such an one if it were for your good for myself i could hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for you even at this moment if it were best nay were it safe but my child for a moment he seemed choked and a great sob rose in his throat he gulped it down and went on ,Dracula
there are here some who would stand between you and death you must not die you must not die by any hand but least of all by your own until the other who has fouled your sweet life is true dead you must not die for if he is still with the quick undead your death would make you even as he is no you must live you must struggle and strive to live though death would seem a boon unspeakable you must fight death himself though he come to you in pain or in joy by the day or the night in safety or in peril on your living soul i charge you that you do not dienay nor think of deathtill this great evil be past the poor dear grew white as death and shock and shivered as i have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide we were all silent we could do nothing at length she grew more calm and turning to him said sweetly but oh so sorrowfully as she held out her hand ,Dracula
i promise you my dear friend that if god will let me live i shall strive to do so till if it may be in his good time this horror may have passed away from me she was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her and we began to discuss what we were to do i told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use and was to keep the record as she had done before she was pleased with the prospect of anything to doif pleased could be used in connection with so grim an interest ,Dracula
it is perhaps well he said that at our meeting after our visit to carfax we decided not to do anything with the earthboxes that lay there had we done so the count must have guessed our purpose and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others but now he does not know our intentions nay more in all probability he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilise his lairs so that he cannot use them as of old we are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to their disposition that when we have examined the house in piccadilly we may track the very last of them today then is ours and in it rests our hope the sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course until it sets tonight that monster must retain whatever form he now has he is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope he cannot melt into thin air nor disappear through cracks or chinks or crannies if he go through a doorway he must open the door like a mortal and so we have this day to hunt out all his lairs and sterilise them so we shall if we have not yet catch him and destroy him drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be in time sure here i started up for i could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so preciously laden with minas life and happiness were flying from us since whilst we talked action was impossible but van helsing held up his hand warningly nay friend jonathan he said in this the quickest way home is the longest way so your proverb say we shall all act and act with desperate quick when the time has come but think in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in piccadilly the count may have many houses which he has bought of them he will have deeds of purchase keys and other things he will have paper that he write on he will have his book of cheques there are many belongings that he must have somewhere why not in this place so central so quiet where he come and go by the front or the back at all hour when in the very vast of the traffic there is none to notice we shall go there and search that house and when we learn what it holds then we do what our friend arthur call in his phrases of hunt stop the earths and so we run down our old foxso is it not ,Dracula
ah my child that i do and indeed there is no wish of me to add to your anguish but just think what can we do until all the world be at movement then will come our time i have thought and thought and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all now we wish to get into the house but we have no key is it not so i nodded ,Dracula
then he looked at me as keenly as he spoke all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer and the belief of your policemen as to whether or no that employer has a good conscience or a bad one your police must indeed be zealous men and cleveroh so cleverin reading the heart that they trouble themselves in such matter no no my friend jonathan you go take the lock off a hundred empty house in this your london or of any city in the world and if you do it as such things are rightly done and at the time such things are rightly done no one will interfere i have read of a gentleman who owned a so fine house in london and when he went for months of summer to switzerland and lock up his house some burglar came and broke window at back and got in then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door before the very eyes of the police then he have an auction in that house and advertise it and put up big notice and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them then he go to a builder and he sell him that house making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time and your police and other authority help him all they can and when that owner come back from his holiday in switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been this was all done en rgle and in our work we shall be en rgle too we shall not go so early that the policemen who have then little to think of shall deem it strange but we shall go after ten oclock when there are many about and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house ,Dracula
look here old fellow said morris it is a capital idea to have all ready in case we want to go horsebacking but dont you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in a byway of walworth or mile end would attract too much attention for our purposes it seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to ,Dracula
mina took a growing interest in everything and i was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night she was very very palealmost ghastly and so thin that her lips were drawn away showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence i did not mention this last lest it should give her needless pain but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor lucy when the count had sucked her blood as yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper but the time as yet was short and there was time for fear ,Dracula
when we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces there were new sources of doubt it was finally agreed that before starting for piccadilly we should destroy the counts lair close at hand in case he should find it out too soon we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction and his presence in his purely material shape and at his weakest might give us some new clue ,Dracula
as to the disposal of forces it was suggested by the professor that after our visit to carfax we should all enter the house in piccadilly that the two doctors and i should remain there whilst lord godalming and quincey found the lairs at walworth and mile end and destroyed them it was possible if not likely the professor urged that the count might appear in piccadilly during the day and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there at any rate we might be able to follow him in force to this plan i strenuously objected and so far as my going was concerned for i said that i intended to stay and protect mina i thought that my mind was made up on the subject but mina would not listen to my objection she said that there might be some law matter in which i could be useful that amongst the counts papers might be some clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvania and that as it was all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the counts extraordinary power i had to give in for minas resolution was fixed she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together as for me she said i have no fear things have been as bad as they can be and whatever may happen must have in it some element of hope or comfort go my husband god can if he wishes it guard me as well alone as with any one present so i started up crying out then in gods name let us come at once for we are losing time the count may come to piccadilly earlier than we think ,Dracula
did i forget shall i evercan i ever can any of us ever forget that terrible scene mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance but the pain overmastered her and she put her hands before her face and shuddered whilst she moaned van helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience he had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort when it struck him what he said he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her oh madam mina he said dear dear madam mina alas that i of all who so reverence you should have said anything so forgetful these stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so but you will forget it will you not he bent low beside her as he spoke she took his hand and looking at him through her tears said hoarsely ,Dracula
no i shall not forget for it is well that i remember and with it i have so much in memory of you that is sweet that i take it all together now you must all be going soon breakfast is ready and we must all eat that we may be strong ,Dracula
now my dear friends we go forth to our terrible enterprise are we all armed as we were on that night when first we visited our enemys lair armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack we all assured him then it is well now madam mina you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset and before then we shall returnif we shall return but before we go let me see you armed against personal attack i have myself since you came down prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know so that he may not enter now let me guard yourself on your forehead i touch this piece of sacred wafer in the name of the father the son and ,Dracula
there was a fearful scream which almost froze our hearts to hear as he had placed the wafer on minas forehead it had seared ithad burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of whitehot metal my poor darlings brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves received the pain of it and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream but the words to her thought came quickly the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement pulling her beautiful hair over her face as the leper of old his mantle she wailed out ,Dracula
unclean unclean even the almighty shuns my polluted flesh i must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgment day they all paused i had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief and putting my arms around held her tight for a few minutes our sorrowful hearts beat together whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that ran tears silently then van helsing turned and said gravely so gravely that i could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired and was stating things outside himself ,Dracula
it may be that you may have to bear that mark till god himself see fit as he most surely shall on the judgment day to redress all wrongs of the earth and of his children that he has placed thereon and oh madam mina my dear my dear may we who love you be there to see when that red scar the sign of gods knowledge of what has been shall pass away and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know for so surely as we live that scar shall pass away when god sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us till then we bear our cross as his son did in obedience to his will it may be that we are chosen instruments of his good pleasure and that we ascend to his bidding as that other through stripes and shame through tears and blood through doubts and fears and all that makes the difference between god and man ,Dracula
there was hope in his words and comfort and they made for resignation mina and i both felt so and simultaneously we each took one of the old mans hands and bent over and kissed it then without a word we all knelt down together and all holding hands swore to be true to each other we men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom each in his own way we loved and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us ,Dracula
to one thing i have made up my mind if we find out that mina must be a vampire in the end then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone i suppose it is thus that in old times one vampire meant many just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks ,Dracula
we entered carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion it was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew had not our minds been made up and had there not been terrible memories to spur us on we could hardly have proceeded with our task we found no papers or any sign of use in the house and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last dr van helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before them ,Dracula
and now my friends we have a duty here to do we must sterilise this earth so sacred of holy memories that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use he has chosen this earth because it has been holy thus we defeat him with his own weapon for we make it more holy still it was sanctified to such use of man now we sanctify it to god as he spoke he took from his bag a screwdriver and a wrench and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open the earth smelled musty and close but we did not somehow seem to mind for our attention was concentrated on the professor taking from his box a piece of the sacred wafer he laid it reverently on the earth and then shutting down the lid began to screw it home we aiding him as he worked ,Dracula
as we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum i looked eagerly and in the window of my own room saw mina i waved my hand to her and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished she nodded in reply to show that she understood the last i saw she was waving her hand in farewell it was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train which was steaming in as we reached the platform ,Dracula
quincey and i will find a locksmith you had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty for under the circumstances it wouldnt seem so bad for us to break into an empty house but you are a solicitor and the incorporated law society might tell you that you should have known better i demurred as to my not sharing any danger even of odium but he went on besides it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us my title will make it all right with the locksmith and with any policeman that may come along you had better go with jack and the professor and stay in the green park somewhere in sight of the house and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away do you all come across we shall be on the lookout for you and shall let you in ,Dracula
the advice is good said van helsing so we said no more godalming and morris hurried off in a cab we following in another at the corner of arlington street our contingent got out and strolled into the green park my heart beat as i saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred looming up grim and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and sprucelooking neighbours we sat down on a bench within good view and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible the minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others ,Dracula
at length we saw a fourwheeler drive up out of it in leisurely fashion got lord godalming and morris and down from the box descended a thickset working man with his rushwoven basket of tools morris paid the cabman who touched his hat and drove away together the two ascended the steps and lord godalming pointed out what he wanted done the workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along the policeman nodded acquiescence and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him after searching through it he took out a selection of tools which he produced to lay beside him in orderly fashion then he stood up looked into the keyhole blew into it and turning to his employers made some remark lord godalming smiled and the man lifted a goodsized bunch of keys selecting one of them he began to probe the lock as if feeling his way with it after fumbling about for a bit he tried a second and then a third all at once the door opened under a slight push from him and he and the two others entered the hall we sat still my own cigar burnt furiously but van helsings went cold altogether we waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring in his bag then he held the door partly open steadying it with his knees whilst he fitted a key to the lock this he finally handed to lord godalming who took out his purse and gave him something the man touched his hat took his bag put on his coat and departed not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction ,Dracula
the place smells so vilely said the latter as we came in it did indeed smell vilelylike the old chapel at carfaxand with our previous experience it was plain to us that the count had been using the place pretty freely we moved to explore the house all keeping together in case of attack for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with and as yet we did not know whether the count might not be in the house in the diningroom which lay at the back of the hall we found eight boxes of earth eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought our work was not over and would never be until we should have found the missing box first we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stoneflagged yard at the blank face of a stable pointed to look like the front of a miniature house there were no windows in it so we were not afraid of being overlooked we did not lose any time in examining the chests with the tools which we had brought with us we opened them one by one and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel it was evident to us that the count was not at present in the house and we proceeded to search for any of his effects ,Dracula
after a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms from basement to attic we came to the conclusion that the diningroom contained any effects which might belong to the count and so we proceeded to minutely examine them they lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great diningroom table there were title deeds of the piccadilly house in a great bundle deeds of the purchase of the houses at mile end and bermondsey notepaper envelopes and pens and ink all were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust there were also a clothes brush a brush and comb and a jug and basinthe latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes probably those belonging to the other houses when we had examined this last find lord godalming and quincey morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the houses in the east and the south took with them the keys in a great bunch and set out to destroy the boxes in these places the rest of us are with what patience we can waiting their returnor the coming of the count ,Dracula
 octoberthe time seemed terrible long whilst we were waiting for the coming of godalming and quincey morris the professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time i could see his beneficent purpose by the side glances which he threw from time to time at harker the poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see last night he was a frank happylooking man with strong youthful face full of energy and with dark brown hair today he is a drawn haggard old man whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and griefwritten lines of his face his energy is still intact in fact he is like a living flame this may yet be his salvation for if all go well it will tide him over the despairing period he will then in a kind of way wake again to the realities of life poor fellow i thought my own trouble was bad enough but his the professor knows this well enough and is doing his best to keep his mind active what he has been saying was under the circumstances of absorbing interest so well as i can remember here it is ,Dracula
i have studied over and over again since they came into my hands all the papers relating to this monster and the more i have studied the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out all through there are signs of his advance not only of his power but of his knowledge of it as i learned from the researches of my friend arminus of budapesth he was in life a most wonderful man soldier statesman and alchemistwhich latter was the highest development of the scienceknowledge of his time he had a mighty brain a learning beyond compare and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse he dared even to attend the scholomance and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay well in him the brain powers survived the physical death though it would seem that memory was not all complete in some faculties of mind he has been and is only a child but he is growing and some things that were childish at the first are now of mans stature he is experimenting and doing it well and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yethe may be yet if we failthe father or furtherer of a new order of beings whose road must lead through death not life ,Dracula
he has all along since his coming been trying his power slowly but surely that big childbrain of his is working well for us it is as yet a childbrain for had he dared at the first to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power however he means to succeed and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow festina lente may well be his motto ,Dracula
ah my child i will be plain do you not see how of late this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally how he has been making use of the zophagous patient to effect his entry into friend johns home for your vampire though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will must at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate but these are not his most important experiments do we not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others he knew not then but that must be so but all the time that so great childbrain of his was growing and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box so he began to help and then when he found that this be allright he try to move them all alone and so he progress and he scatter these graves of him and none but he know where they are hidden he may have intend to bury them deep in the ground so that he only use them in the night or at such time as he can change his form they do him equal well and none may know these are his hidingplace but my child do not despair this knowledge come to him just too late already all of his lairs but one be sterilise as for him and before the sunset this shall be so then he have no place where he can move and hide i delayed this morning that so we might be sure is there not more at stake for us than for him then why we not be even more careful than him by my clock it is one hour and already if all be well friend arthur and quincey are on their way to us today is our day and we must go sure if slow and lose no chance see there are five of us when those absent ones return ,Dracula
whilst he was speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door the double postmans knock of the telegraph boy we all moved out to the hall with one impulse and van helsing holding up his hand to us to keep silence stepped to the door and opened it the boy handed in a despatch the professor closed the door again and after looking at the direction opened it and read aloud ,Dracula
oh hush hush my child said van helsing god does not purchase souls in this wise and the devil though he may purchase does not keep faith but god is merciful and just and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear madam mina think you how her pain would be doubled did she but hear your wild words do not fear any of us we are all devoted to this cause and today shall see the end the time is coming for action today this vampire is limit to the powers of man and till sunset he may not change it will take him time to arrive heresee it is twenty minutes past oneand there are yet some times before he can hither come be he never so quick what we must hope for is that my lord arthur and quincey arrive first ,Dracula
about half an hour after we had received mrs harkers telegram there came a quiet resolute knock at the hall door it was just an ordinary knock such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen but it made the professors heart and mine beat loudly we looked at each other and together moved out into the hall we each held ready to use our various armamentsthe spiritual in the left hand the mortal in the right van helsing pulled back the latch and holding the door half open stood back having both hands ready for action the gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step close to the door we saw lord godalming and quincey morris they came quickly in and closed the door behind them the former saying as they moved along the hall ,Dracula
he will be here before long now said van helsing who had been consulting his pocketbook nota bene in madams telegram he went south from carfax that means he went to cross the river and he could only do so at slack of tide which should be something before one oclock that he went south has a meaning for us he is as yet only suspicious and he went from carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least you must have been at bermondsey only a short time before him that he is not here already shows that he went to mile end next this took him some time for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way believe me my friends we shall not have long to wait now we should have ready some plan of attack so that we may throw away no chance hush there is no time now have all your arms be ready he held up a warning hand as he spoke for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door ,Dracula
i could not but admire even at such a moment the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself in all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world quincey morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action and arthur and i had been accustomed to obey him implicitly now the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively with a swift glance around the room he at once laid out our plan of attack and without speaking a word with a gesture placed us each in position van helsing harker and i were just behind the door so that when it was opened the professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the incomer and the door godalming behind and quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window we waited in a suspense that made the seconds pass with nightmare slowness the slow careful steps came along the hall the count was evidently prepared for some surpriseat least he feared it ,Dracula
suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him there was something so pantherlike in the movementsomething so unhuman that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming the first to act was harker who with a quick movement threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house as the count saw us a horrible sort of snarl passed over his face showing the eyeteeth long and pointed but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold stare of lionlike disdain his expression again changed as with a single impulse we all advanced upon him it was a pity that we had not some better organised plan of attack for even at the moment i wondered what we were to do i did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything harker evidently meant to try the matter for he had ready his great kukri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him the blow was a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the counts leap back saved him a second less and the trenchant blade had shorne through his heart as it was the point just cut the cloth of his coat making a wide gap whence a bundle of banknotes and a stream of gold fell out the expression of the counts face was so hellish that for a moment i feared for harker though i saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke instinctively i moved forward with a protective impulse holding the crucifix and wafer in my left hand i felt a mighty power fly along my arm and it was without surprise that i saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us it would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignityof anger and hellish ragewhich came over the counts face his waxen hue became greenishyellow by the contrast of his burning eyes and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound the next instant with a sinuous dive he swept under harkers arm ere his blow could fall and grasping a handful of the money from the floor dashed across the room threw himself at the window amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass he tumbled into the flagged area below through the sound of the shivering glass i could hear the ting of the gold as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging ,Dracula
you think to baffle me youwith your pale faces all in a row like sheep in a butchers you shall be sorry yet each one of you you think you have left me without a place to rest but i have more my revenge is just begun i spread it over centuries and time is on my side your girls that you all love are mine already and through them you and others shall yet be minemy creatures to do my bidding and to be my jackals when i want to feed bah with a contemptuous sneer he passed quickly through the door and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him a door beyond opened and shut the first of us to speak was the professor as realising the difficulty of following him through the stable we moved toward the hall ,Dracula
we have learnt somethingmuch notwithstanding his brave words he fears us he fear time he fear want for if not why he hurry so his very tone betray him or my ears deceive why take that money you follow quick you are hunters of wild beast and understand it so for me i make sure that nothing here may be of use to him if so that he return as he spoke he put the money remaining into his pocket took the titledeeds in the bundle as harker had left them and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace where he set fire to them with a match ,Dracula
godalming and morris had rushed out into the yard and harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the count he had however bolted the stable door and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him van helsing and i tried to make inquiry at the back of the house but the mews was deserted and no one had seen him depart ,Dracula
let us go back to madam minapoor poor dear madam mina all we can do just now is done and we can there at least protect her but we need not despair there is but one more earthbox and we must try to find it when that is done all may yet be well i could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort harker the poor fellow was quite broken down now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppresshe was thinking of his wife ,Dracula
with sad hearts we came back to my house where we found mrs harker waiting us with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness when she saw our faces her own became as pale as death for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer and then she said cheerfully ,Dracula
i can never thank you all enough oh my poor darling as she spoke she took her husbands grey head in her hands and kissed itlay your poor head here and rest it all will yet be well dear god will protect us if he so will it in his good intent the poor fellow groaned there was no place for words in his sublime misery ,Dracula
we had a sort of perfunctory supper together and i think it cheered us all up somewhat it was perhaps the mere animal heat of food to hungry peoplefor none of us had eaten anything since breakfastor the sense of companionship may have helped us but anyhow we were all less miserable and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope true to our promise we told mrs harker everything which had passed and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband and red at others when his devotion to her was manifested she listened bravely and with calmness when we came to the part where harker had rushed at the count so recklessly she clung to her husbands arm and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come she said nothing however till the narration was all done and matters had been brought right up to the present time then without letting go her husbands hand she stood up amongst us and spoke oh that i could give any idea of the scene of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation with the red scar on her forehead of which she was conscious and which we saw with grinding of our teethremembering whence and how it came her loving kindness against our grim hate her tender faith against all our fears and doubting and we knowing that so far as symbols went she with all her goodness and purity and faith was outcast from god ,Dracula
jonathan she said and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness jonathan dear and you all my true true friends i want you to bear something in mind through all this dreadful time i know that you must fightthat you must destroy even as you destroyed the false lucy so that the true lucy might live hereafter but it is not a work of hate that poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all just think what will be his joy when he too is destroyed in his worser part that his better part may have spiritual immortality you must be pitiful to him too though it may not hold your hands from his destruction ,Dracula
as she spoke i could see her husbands face darken and draw together as though the passion in him were shrivelling his being to its core instinctively the clasp on his wifes hand grew closer till his knuckles looked white she did not flinch from the pain which i knew she must have suffered but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever as she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet almost tearing his hand from hers as he spoke ,Dracula
oh hush oh hush in the name of the good god dont say such things jonathan my husband or you will crush me with fear and horror just think my deari have been thinking all this long long day of itthat  perhaps  some day  i too may need such pity and that some other like youand with equal cause for angermay deny it to me oh my husband my husband indeed i would have spared you such a thought had there been another way but i pray that god may not have treasured your wild words except as the heartbroken wail of a very loving and sorely stricken man oh god let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered who all his life has done no wrong and on whom so many sorrows have come ,Dracula
we men were all in tears now there was no resisting them and we wept openly she wept too to see that her sweeter counsels had prevailed her husband flung himself on his knees beside her and putting his arms round her hid his face in the folds of her dress van helsing beckoned to us and we stole out of the room leaving the two loving hearts alone with their god ,Dracula
before they retired the professor fixed up the room against any coming of the vampire and assured mrs harker that she might rest in peace she tried to school herself to the belief and manifestly for her husbands sake tried to seem content it was a brave struggle and was i think and believe not without its reward van helsing had placed at hand a bell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency when they had retired quincey godalming and i arranged that we should sit up dividing the night between us and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady the first watch falls to quincey so the rest of us shall be off to bed as soon as we can godalming has already turned in for his is the second watch now that my work is done i too shall go to bed ,Dracula
 october close to midnighti thought yesterday would never end there was over me a yearning for sleep in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed and that any change must now be for the better before we parted we discussed what our next step was to be but we could arrive at no result all we knew was that one earthbox remained and that the count alone knew where it was if he chooses to lie hidden he may baffle us for years and in the meantimethe thought is too horrible i dare not think of it even now this i know that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection that one is my poor wronged darling i love her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable surely god will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature this is hope to me we are all drifting reefwards now and faith is our only anchor thank god mina is sleeping and sleeping without dreams i fear what her dreams might be like with such terrible memories to ground them in she has not been so calm within my seeing since the sunset then for a while there came over her face a repose which was like spring after the blasts of march i thought at the time that it was the softness of the red sunset on her face but somehow now i think it has a deeper meaning i am not sleepy myself though i am wearyweary to death however i must try to sleep for there is tomorrow to think of and there is no rest for me until ,Dracula
lateri must have fallen asleep for i was awaked by mina who was sitting up in bed with a startled look on her face i could see easily for we did not leave the room in darkness she had placed a warning hand over my mouth and now she whispered in my ear ,Dracula
 october morningonce again during the night i was wakened by mina this time we had all had a good sleep for the grey of the coming dawn was making the windows into sharp oblongs and the gas flame was like a speck rather than a disc of light she said to me hurriedly ,Dracula
i have an idea i suppose it must have come in the night and matured without my knowing it he must hypnotise me before the dawn and then i shall be able to speak go quick dearest the time is getting close i went to the door dr seward was resting on the mattress and seeing me he sprang to his feet ,Dracula
in two or three minutes later van helsing was in the room in his dressinggown and mr morris and lord godalming were with dr seward at the door asking questions when the professor saw mina smilea positive smile ousted the anxiety of his face he rubbed his hands as he said ,Dracula
oh my dear madam mina this is indeed a change see friend jonathan we have got our dear madam mina as of old back to us today then turning to her he said cheerfully and what am i do for you for at this hour you do not want me for nothings ,Dracula
looking fixedly at her he commenced to make passes in front of her from over the top of her head downward with each hand in turn mina gazed at him fixedly for a few minutes during which my own heart beat like a trip hammer for i felt that some crisis was at hand gradually her eyes closed and she sat stock still only by the gentle heaving of her bosom could one know that she was alive the professor made a few more passes and then stopped and i could see that his forehead was covered with great beads of perspiration mina opened her eyes but she did not seem the same woman there was a faraway look in her eyes and her voice had a sad dreaminess which was new to me raising his hand to impose silence the professor motioned to me to bring the others in they came on tiptoe closing the door behind them and stood at the foot of the bed looking on mina appeared not to see them the stillness was broken by van helsings voice speaking in a low level tone which would not break the current of her thoughts ,Dracula
i do not know sleep has no place it can call its own for several minutes there was silence mina sat rigid and the professor stood staring at her fixedly the rest of us hardly dared to breathe the room was growing lighter without taking his eyes from minas face dr van helsing motioned me to pull up the blind i did so and the day seemed just upon us a red streak shot up and a rosy light seemed to diffuse itself through the room on the instant the professor spoke again ,Dracula
by this time the sun had risen and we were all in the full light of day dr van helsing placed his hands on minas shoulders and laid her head down softly on her pillow she lay like a sleeping child for a few moments and then with a long sigh awoke and stared in wonder to see us all around her have i been talking in my sleep was all she said she seemed however to know the situation without telling though she was eager to know what she had told the professor repeated the conversation and she said ,Dracula
stay my friends that ship wherever it was was weighing anchor whilst she spoke there are many ships weighing anchor at the moment in your so great port of london which of them is it that you seek god be thanked that we have once again a clue though whither it may lead us we know not we have been blind somewhat blind after the manner of men since when we can look back we see what we might have seen looking forward if we had been able to see what we might have seen alas but that sentence is a puddle is it not we can know now what was in the counts mind when he seize that money though jonathans so fierce knife put him in the danger that even he dread he meant escape hear me escape he saw that with but one earthbox left and a pack of men following like dogs after a fox this london was no place for him he have take his last earthbox on board a ship and he leave the land he think to escape but no we follow him tally ho as friend arthur would say when he put on his red frock our old fox is wily oh so wily and we must follow with wile i too am wily and i think his mind in a little while in meantime we may rest and in peace for there are waters between us which he do not want to pass and which he could not if he wouldunless the ship were to touch the land and then only at full or slack tide see and the sun is just rose and all day to sunset is to us let us take bath and dress and have breakfast which we all need and which we can eat comfortably since he be not in the same land with us mina looked at him appealingly as she asked ,Dracula
you are to stay with your dear madam mina we shall go to make our searchif i can call it so for it is not search but knowing and we seek confirmation only but do you stay and take care of her today this is your best and most holiest office this day nothing can find him here let me tell you that so you will know what we four know already for i have tell them he our enemy have gone away he have gone back to his castle in transylvania i know it so well as if a great hand of fire wrote it on the wall he have prepare for this in some way and that last earthbox was ready to ship somewheres for this he took the money for this he hurry at the last lest we catch him before the sun go down it was his last hope save that he might hide in the tomb that he think poor miss lucy being as he thought like him keep open to him but there was not of time when that fail he make straight for his last resourcehis last earthwork i might say did i wish double entente he is clever oh so clever he know that his game here was finish and so he decide he go back home he find ship going by the route he came and he go in it we go off now to find what ship and whither bound when we have discover that we come back and tell you all then we will comfort you and poor dear madam mina with new hope for it will be hope when you think it over that all is not lost this very creature that we pursue he take hundreds of years to get so far as london and yet in one day when we know of the disposal of him we drive him out he is finite though he is powerful to do much harm and suffers not as we do but we are strong each in our purpose and we are all more strong together take heart afresh dear husband of madam mina this battle is but begun and in the end we shall winso sure as that god sits on high to watch over his children therefore be of much comfort till we return ,Dracula
 octoberwhen i read to mina van helsings message in the phonograph the poor girl brightened up considerably already the certainty that the count is out of the country has given her comfort and comfort is strength to her for my own part now that his horrible danger is not face to face with us it seems almost impossible to believe in it even my own terrible experiences in castle dracula seem like a longforgotten dream here in the crisp autumn air in the bright sunlight ,Dracula
alas how can i disbelieve in the midst of my thought my eye fell on the red scar on my poor darlings white forehead whilst that lasts there can be no disbelief and afterwards the very memory of it will keep faith crystal clear mina and i fear to be idle so we have been over all the diaries again and again somehow although the reality seems greater each time the pain and the fear seem less there is something of a guiding purpose manifest throughout which is comforting mina says that perhaps we are the instruments of ultimate good it may be i shall try to think as she does we have never spoken to each other yet of the future it is better to wait till we see the professor and the others after their investigations ,Dracula
as i knew that he wanted to get back to transylvania i felt sure that he must go by the danube mouth or by somewhere in the black sea since by that way he come it was a dreary blank that was before us omne ignotum pro magnifico and so with heavy hearts we start to find what ships leave for the black sea last night he was in sailing ship since madam mina tell of sails being set these not so important as to go in your list of the shipping in the times and so we go by suggestion of lord godalming to your lloyds where are note of all ships that sail however so small there we find that only one blackseabound ship go out with the tide she is the czarina catherine and she sail from doolittles wharf for varna and thence on to other parts and up the danube soh said i this is the ship whereon is the count so off we go to doolittles wharf and there we find a man in an office of wood so small that the man look bigger than the office from him we inquire of the goings of the czarina catherine he swear much and he red face and loud of voice but he good fellow all the same and when quincey give him something from his pocket which crackle as he roll it up and put it in a so small bag which he have hid deep in his clothing he still better fellow and humble servant to us he come with us and ask many men who are rough and hot these be better fellows too when they have been no more thirsty they say much of blood and bloom and of others which i comprehend not though i guess what they mean but nevertheless they tell us all things which we want to know ,Dracula
they make known to us among them how last afternoon at about five oclock comes a man so hurry a tall man thin and pale with high nose and teeth so white and eyes that seem to be burning that he be all in black except that he have a hat of straw which suit not him or the time that he scatter his money in making quick inquiry as to what ship sails for the black sea and for where some took him to the office and then to the ship where he will not go aboard but halt at shore end of gangplank and ask that the captain come to him the captain come when told that he will be pay well and though he swear much at the first he agree to term then the thin man go and some one tell him where horse and cart can be hired he go there and soon he come again himself driving cart on which a great box this he himself lift down though it take several to put it on truck for the ship he give much talk to captain as to how and where his box is to be place but the captain like it not and swear at him in many tongues and tell him that if he like he can come and see where it shall be but he say no that he come not yet for that he have much to do whereupon the captain tell him that he had better be quickwith bloodfor that his ship will leave the placeof bloodbefore the turn of the tidewith blood then the thin man smile and say that of course he must go when he think fit but he will be surprise if he go quite so soon the captain swear again polyglot and the thin man make him bow and thank him and say that he will so far intrude on his kindness as to come aboard before the sailing final the captain more red than ever and in more tongues tell him that he doesnt want no frenchmenwith bloom upon them and also with bloodin his shipwith blood on her also and so after asking where there might be close at hand a ship where he might purchase ship forms he departed ,Dracula
no one knew where he went or bloomin well cared as they said for they had something else to think ofwell with blood again for it soon became apparent to all that the czarina catherine would not sail as was expected a thin mist began to creep up from the river and it grew and grew till soon a dense fog enveloped the ship and all around her the captain swore polyglotvery polyglotpolyglot with bloom and blood but he could do nothing the water rose and rose and he began to fear that he would lose the tide altogether he was in no friendly mood when just at full tide the thin man came up the gangplank again and asked to see where his box had been stowed then the captain replied that he wished that he and his boxold and with much bloom and bloodwere in hell but the thin man did not be offend and went down with the mate and saw where it was place and came up and stood awhile on deck in fog he must have come off by himself for none notice him indeed they thought not of him for soon the fog begin to melt away and all was clear again my friends of the thirst and the language that was of bloom and blood laughed as they told how the captains swears exceeded even his usual polyglot and was more than ever full of picturesque when on questioning other mariners who were on movement up and down on the river that hour he found that few of them had seen any of fog at all except where it lay round the wharf however the ship went out on the ebb tide and was doubtless by morning far down the river mouth she was by then when they told us well out to sea ,Dracula
and so my dear madam mina it is that we have to rest for a time for our enemy is on the sea with the fog at his command on his way to the danube mouth to sail a ship takes time go she never so quick and when we start we go on land more quick and we meet him there our best hope is to come on him when in the box between sunrise and sunset for then he can make no struggle and we may deal with him as we should there are days for us in which we can make ready our plan we know all about where he go for we have seen the owner of the ship who have shown us invoices and all papers that can be the box we seek is to be landed in varna and to be given to an agent one ristics who will there present his credentials and so our merchant friend will have done his part when he ask if there be any wrong for that so he can telegraph and have inquiry made at varna we say no for what is to be done is not for police or of the customs it must be done by us alone and in our own way ,Dracula
when dr van helsing had done speaking i asked him if he were certain that the count had remained on board the ship he replied we have the best proof of that your own evidence when in the hypnotic trance this morning i asked him again if it were really necessary that they should pursue the count for oh i dread jonathan leaving me and i know that he would surely go if the others went he answered in growing passion at first quietly as he went on however he grew more angry and more forceful till in the end we could not but see wherein was at least some of that personal dominance which made him so long a master amongst men ,Dracula
yes it is necessarynecessarynecessary for your sake in the first and then for the sake of humanity this monster has done much harm already in the narrow scope where he find himself and in the short time when as yet he was only as a body groping his so small measure in darkness and not knowing all this have i told these others you my dear madam mina will learn it in the phonograph of my friend john or in that of your husband i have told them how the measure of leaving his own barren landbarren of peoplesand coming to a new land where life of man teems till they are like the multitude of standing corn was the work of centuries were another of the undead like him to try to do what he has done perhaps not all the centuries of the world that have been or that will be could aid him with this one all the forces of nature that are occult and deep and strong must have worked together in some wondrous way the very place where he have been alive undead for all these centuries is full of strangeness of the geologic and chemical world there are deep caverns and fissures that reach none know whither there have been volcanoes some of whose openings still send out waters of strange properties and gases that kill or make to vivify doubtless there is something magnetic or electric in some of these combinations of occult forces which work for physical life in strange way and in himself were from the first some great qualities in a hard and warlike time he was celebrate that he have more iron nerve more subtle brain more braver heart than any man in him some vital principle have in strange way found their utmost and as his body keep strong and grow and thrive so his brain grow too all this without that diabolic aid which is surely to him for it have to yield to the powers that come from and are symbolic of good and now this is what he is to us he have infect youoh forgive me my dear that i must say such but it is for good of you that i speak he infect you in such wise that even if he do no more you have only to liveto live in your own old sweet way and so in time death which is of mans common lot and with gods sanction shall make you like to him this must not be we have sworn together that it must not thus are we ministers of gods own wish that the world and men for whom his son die will not be given over to monsters whose very existence would defame him he have allowed us to redeem one soul already and we go out as the old knights of the cross to redeem more like them we shall travel towards the sunrise and like them if we fall we fall in good cause he paused and i said ,Dracula
aha he said your simile of the tiger good for me and i shall adopt him your maneater as they of india call the tiger who has once tasted blood of the human care no more for the other prey but prowl unceasing till he get him this that we hunt from our village is a tiger too a maneater and he never cease to prowl nay in himself he is not one to retire and stay afar in his life his living life he go over the turkey frontier and attack his enemy on his own ground he be beaten back but did he stay no he come again and again and again look at his persistence and endurance with the childbrain that was to him he have long since conceive the idea of coming to a great city what does he do he find out the place of all the world most of promise for him then he deliberately set himself down to prepare for the task he find in patience just how is his strength and what are his powers he study new tongues he learn new social life new environment of old ways the politic the law the finance the science the habit of a new land and a new people who have come to be since he was his glimpse that he have had whet his appetite only and enkeen his desire nay it help him to grow as to his brain for it all prove to him how right he was at the first in his surmises he have done this alone all alone from a ruin tomb in a forgotten land what more may he not do when the greater world of thought is open to him he that can smile at death as we know him who can flourish in the midst of diseases that kill off whole peoples oh if such an one was to come from god and not the devil what a force for good might he not be in this old world of ours but we are pledged to set the world free our toil must be in silence and our efforts all in secret for in this enlightened age when men believe not even what they see the doubting of wise men would be his greatest strength it would be at once his sheath and his armour and his weapons to destroy us his enemies who are willing to peril even our own souls for the safety of one we lovefor the good of mankind and for the honour and glory of god ,Dracula
after a general discussion it was determined that for tonight nothing be definitely settled that we should all sleep on the facts and try to think out the proper conclusions tomorrow at breakfast we are to meet again and after making our conclusions known to one another we shall decide on some definite cause of action ,Dracula
 octoberwe all rose early and i think that sleep did much for each and all of us when we met at early breakfast there was more general cheerfulness than any of us had ever expected to experience again ,Dracula
it is really wonderful how much resilience there is in human nature let any obstructing cause no matter what be removed in any wayeven by deathand we fly back to first principles of hope and enjoyment more than once as we sat around the table my eyes opened in wonder whether the whole of the past days had not been a dream it was only when i caught sight of the red blotch on mrs harkers forehead that i was brought back to reality even now when i am gravely revolving the matter it is almost impossible to realise that the cause of all our trouble is still existent even mrs harker seems to lose sight of her trouble for whole spells it is only now and again when something recalls it to her mind that she thinks of her terrible scar we are to meet here in my study in half an hour and decide on our course of action i see only one immediate difficulty i know it by instinct rather than reason we shall all have to speak frankly and yet i fear that in some mysterious way poor mrs harkers tongue is tied i know that she forms conclusions of her own and from all that has been i can guess how brilliant and how true they must be but she will not or cannot give them utterance i have mentioned this to van helsing and he and i are to talk it over when we are alone i suppose it is some of that horrid poison which has got into her veins beginning to work the count had his own purposes when he gave her what van helsing called the vampires baptism of blood well there may be a poison that distils itself out of good things in an age when the existence of ptomaines is a mystery we should not wonder at anything one thing i know that if my instinct be true regarding poor mrs harkers silences then there is a terrible difficultyan unknown dangerin the work before us the same power that compels her silence may compel her speech i dare not think further for so i should in my thoughts dishonour a noble woman ,Dracula
laterwhen the professor came in we talked over the state of things i could see that he had something on his mind which he wanted to say but felt some hesitancy about broaching the subject after beating about the bush a little he said suddenly ,Dracula
with the sad experience of miss lucy we must this time be warned before things go too far our task is now in reality more difficult than ever and this new trouble makes every hour of the direst importance i can see the characteristics of the vampire coming in her face it is now but very very slight but it is to be seen if we have eyes to notice without to prejudge her teeth are some sharper and at times her eyes are more hard but these are not all there is to her the silence now often as so it was with miss lucy she did not speak even when she wrote that which she wished to be known later now my fear is this if it be that she can by our hypnotic trance tell what the count see and hear is it not more true that he who have hypnotise her first and who have drink of her very blood and make her drink of his should if he will compel her mind to disclose to him that which she know i nodded acquiescence he went on ,Dracula
then what we must do is to prevent this we must keep her ignorant of our intent and so she cannot tell what she know not this is a painful task oh so painful that it heartbreak me to think of but it must be when today we meet i must tell her that for reason which we will not to speak she must not more be of our council but be simply guarded by us he wiped his forehead which had broken out in profuse perspiration at the thought of the pain which he might have to inflict upon the poor soul already so tortured i knew that it would be some sort of comfort to him if i told him that i also had come to the same conclusion for at any rate it would take away the pain of doubt i told him and the effect was as i expected ,Dracula
laterat the very outset of our meeting a great personal relief was experienced by both van helsing and myself mrs harker had sent a message by her husband to say that she would not join us at present as she thought it better that we should be free to discuss our movements without her presence to embarrass us the professor and i looked at each other for an instant and somehow we both seemed relieved for my own part i thought that if mrs harker realised the danger herself it was much pain as well as much danger averted under the circumstances we agreed by a questioning look and answer with finger on lip to preserve silence in our suspicions until we should have been able to confer alone again we went at once into our plan of campaign van helsing roughly put the facts before us first ,Dracula
the czarina catherine left the thames yesterday morning it will take her at the quickest speed she has ever made at least three weeks to reach varna but we can travel overland to the same place in three days now if we allow for two days less for the ships voyage owing to such weather influences as we know that the count can bring to bear and if we allow a whole day and night for any delays which may occur to us then we have a margin of nearly two weeks thus in order to be quite safe we must leave here on th at latest then we shall at any rate be in varna a day before the ship arrives and able to make such preparations as may be necessary of course we shall all go armedarmed against evil things spiritual as well as physical here quincey morris added ,Dracula
i understand that the count comes from a wolf country and it may be that he shall get there before us i propose that we add winchesters to our armament i have a kind of belief in a winchester when there is any trouble of that sort around do you remember art when we had the pack after us at tobolsk what wouldnt we have given then for a repeater apiece ,Dracula
good said van helsing winchesters it shall be quinceys head is level at all times but most so when there is to hunt metaphor be more dishonour to science than wolves be of danger to man in the meantime we can do nothing here and as i think that varna is not familiar to any of us why not go there more soon it is as long to wait here as there tonight and tomorrow we can get ready and then if all be well we four can set out on our journey ,Dracula
let us talk of that part of it in the morning i want to consult with mina i thought that now was the time for van helsing to warn him not to disclose our plans to her but he took no notice i looked at him significantly and coughed for answer he put his finger on his lips and turned away ,Dracula
 october afternoonfor some time after our meeting this morning i could not think the new phases of things leave my mind in a state of wonder which allows no room for active thought minas determination not to take any part in the discussion set me thinking and as i could not argue the matter with her i could only guess i am as far as ever from a solution now the way the others received it too puzzled me the last time we talked of the subject we agreed that there was to be no more concealment of anything amongst us mina is sleeping now calmly and sweetly like a little child her lips are curved and her face beams with happiness thank god there are such moments still for her ,Dracula
laterhow strange it all is i sat watching minas happy sleep and came as near to being happy myself as i suppose i shall ever be as the evening drew on and the earth took its shadows from the sun sinking lower the silence of the room grew more and more solemn to me all at once mina opened her eyes and looking at me tenderly said ,Dracula
jonathan i want you to promise me something on your word of honour a promise made to me but made holily in gods hearing and not to be broken though i should go down on my knees and implore you with bitter tears quick you must make it to me at once ,Dracula
but dear one she said with such spiritual intensity that her eyes were like pole stars it is i who wish it and it is not for myself you can ask dr van helsing if i am not right if he disagrees you may do as you will nay more if you all agree later you are absolved from the promise ,Dracula
promise me that you will not tell me anything of the plans formed for the campaign against the count not by word or inference or implication not at any time whilst this remains to me and she solemnly pointed to the scar i saw that she was in earnest and said solemnly ,Dracula
later midnightmina has been bright and cheerful all the evening so much so that all the rest seemed to take courage as if infected somewhat with her gaiety as a result even i myself felt as if the pall of gloom which weighs us down were somewhat lifted we all retired early mina is now sleeping like a little child it is a wonderful thing that her faculty of sleep remains to her in the midst of her terrible trouble thank god for it for then at least she can forget her care perhaps her example may affect me as her gaiety did tonight i shall try it oh for a dreamless sleep ,Dracula
 october morninganother surprise mina woke me early about the same time as yesterday and asked me to bring dr van helsing i thought that it was another occasion for hypnotism and without question went for the professor he had evidently expected some such call for i found him dressed in his room his door was ajar so that he could hear the opening of the door of our room he came at once as he passed into the room he asked mina if the others might come too ,Dracula
but why dear madam mina you know that your safety is our solemnest duty we go into danger to which you are or may be more liable than any of us fromfrom circumstancesthings that have been he paused embarrassed ,Dracula
i know that is why i must go i can tell you now whilst the sun is coming up i may not be able again i know that when the count wills me i must go i know that if he tells me to come in secret i must come by wile by any device to hoodwinkeven jonathan god saw the look that she turned on me as she spoke and if there be indeed a recording angel that look is noted to her everlasting honour i could only clasp her hand i could not speak my emotion was too great for even the relief of tears she went on ,Dracula
you men are brave and strong you are strong in your numbers for you can defy that which would break down the human endurance of one who had to guard alone besides i may be of service since you can hypnotise me and so learn that which even i myself do not know dr van helsing said very gravely ,Dracula
madam mina you are as always most wise you shall with us come and together we shall do that which we go forth to achieve when he had spoken minas long spell of silence made me look at her she had fallen back on her pillow asleep she did not even wake when i had pulled up the blind and let in the sunlight which flooded the room van helsing motioned to me to come with him quietly we went to his room and within a minute lord godalming dr seward and mr morris were with us also he told them what mina had said and went on ,Dracula
in the morning we shall leave for varna we have now to deal with a new factor madam mina oh but her soul is true it is to her an agony to tell us so much as she has done but it is most right and we are warned in time there must be no chance lost and in varna we must be ready to act the instant when that ship arrives ,Dracula
we shall at the first board that ship then when we have identified the box we shall place a branch of the wild rose on it this we shall fasten for when it is there none can emerge so at least says the superstition and to superstition must we trust at the first it was mans faith in the early and it have its root in faith still then when we get the opportunity that we seek when none are near to see we shall open the box andand all will be well ,Dracula
i shall not wait for any opportunity said morris when i see the box i shall open it and destroy the monster though there were a thousand men looking on and if i am to be wiped out for it the next moment i grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm as a piece of steel i think he understood my look i hope he did ,Dracula
good boy said dr van helsing brave boy quincey is all man god bless him for it my child believe me none of us shall lag behind or pause from any fear i do but say what we may dowhat we must do but indeed indeed we cannot say what we shall do there are so many things which may happen and their ways and their ends are so various that until the moment we may not say we shall all be armed in all ways and when the time for the end has come our effort shall not be lack now let us today put all our affairs in order let all things which touch on others dear to us and who on us depend be complete for none of us can tell what or when or how the end may be as for me my own affairs are regulate and as i have nothing else to do i shall go make arrangements for the travel i shall have all tickets and so forth for our journey ,Dracula
it is now drawing towards the sunset minas uneasiness calls my attention to it i am sure that there is something on her mind which the time of exact sunset will reveal these occasions are becoming harrowing times for us all for each sunrise and sunset opens up some new dangersome new pain which however may in gods will be means to a good end i write all these things in the diary since my darling must not hear them now but if it may be that she can see them again they shall be ready ,Dracula
i think that none of us were surprised when we were asked to see mrs harker a little before the time of sunset we have of late come to understand that sunrise and sunset are to her times of peculiar freedom when her old self can be manifest without any controlling force subduing or restraining her or inciting her to action this mood or condition begins some half hour or more before actual sunrise or sunset and lasts till either the sun is high or whilst the clouds are still aglow with the rays streaming above the horizon at first there is a sort of negative condition as if some tie were loosened and then the absolute freedom quickly follows when however the freedom ceases the changeback or relapse comes quickly preceded only by a spell of warning silence ,Dracula
tonight when we met she was somewhat constrained and bore all the signs of an internal struggle i put it down myself to her making a violent effort at the earliest instant she could do so a very few minutes however gave her complete control of herself then motioning her husband to sit beside her on the sofa where she was half reclining she made the rest of us bring chairs up close taking her husbands hand in hers began ,Dracula
we are all here together in freedom for perhaps the last time i know dear i know that you will always be with me to the end this was to her husband whose hand had as we could see tightened upon hers in the morning we go out upon our task and god alone knows what may be in store for any of us you are going to be so good to me as to take me with you i know that all that brave earnest men can do for a poor weak woman whose soul perhaps is lostno no not yet but is at any rate at stakeyou will do but you must remember that i am not as you are there is a poison in my blood in my soul which may destroy me which must destroy me unless some relief comes to us oh my friends you know as well as i do that my soul is at stake and though i know there is one way out for me you must not and i must not take it she looked appealingly to us all in turn beginning and ending with her husband ,Dracula
that i may die now either by my own hand or that of another before the greater evil is entirely wrought i know and you know that were i once dead you could and would set free my immortal spirit even as you did my poor lucys were death or the fear of death the only thing that stood in the way i would not shrink to die here now amidst the friends who love me but death is not all i cannot believe that to die in such a case when there is hope before us and a bitter task to be done is gods will therefore i on my part give up here the certainty of eternal rest and go out into the dark where may be the blackest things that the world or the nether world holds we were all silent for we knew instinctively that this was only a prelude the faces of the others were set and harkers grew ashen grey perhaps he guessed better than any of us what was coming she continued ,Dracula
this is what i can give into the hotchpot i could not but note the quaint legal phrase which she used in such a place and with all seriousness what will each of you give your lives i know she went on quickly that is easy for brave men your lives are gods and you can give them back to him but what will you give to me she looked again questioningly but this time avoided her husbands face quincey seemed to understand he nodded and her face lit up then i shall tell you plainly what i want for there must be no doubtful matter in this connection between us now you must promise me one and alleven you my beloved husbandthat should the time come you will kill me ,Dracula
when you shall be convinced that i am so changed that it is better that i die than i may live when i am thus dead in the flesh then you will without a moments delay drive a stake through me and cut off my head or do whatever else may be wanting to give me rest ,Dracula
im only a rough fellow who hasnt perhaps lived as a man should to win such a distinction but i swear to you by all that i hold sacred and dear that should the time ever come i shall not flinch from the duty that you have set us and i promise you too that i shall make all certain for if i am only doubtful i shall take it that the time has come ,Dracula
and i said lord godalming each of them in turn kneeling to her to take the oath i followed myself then her husband turned to her waneyed and with a greenish pallor which subdued the snowy whiteness of his hair and asked ,Dracula
you too my dearest she said with infinite yearning of pity in her voice and eyes you must not shrink you are nearest and dearest and all the world to me our souls are knit into one for all life and all time think dear that there have been times when brave men have killed their wives and their womenkind to keep them from falling into the hands of the enemy their hands did not falter any the more because those that they loved implored them to slay them it is mens duty towards those whom they love in such times of sore trial and oh my dear if it is to be that i must meet death at any hand let it be at the hand of him that loves me best dr van helsing i have not forgotten your mercy in poor lucys case to him who lovedshe stopped with a flying blush and changed her phraseto him who had best right to give her peace if that time shall come again i look to you to make it a happy memory of my husbands life that it was his loving hand which set me free from the awful thrall upon me ,Dracula
and now one word of warning a warning which you must never forget this time if it ever come may come quickly and unexpectedly and in such case you must lose no time in using your opportunity at such a time i myself might benay if the time ever comes shall beleagued with your enemy against you ,Dracula
one more request she became very solemn as she said this it is not vital and necessary like the other but i want you to do one thing for me if you will we all acquiesced but no one spoke there was no need to speak ,Dracula
i want you to read the burial service she was interrupted by a deep groan from her husband taking his hand in hers she held it over her heart and continued you must read it over me some day whatever may be the issue of all this fearful state of things it will be a sweet thought to all or some of us you my dearest will i hope read it for then it will be in your voice in my memory for evercome what may ,Dracula
how can ihow could any onetell of that strange scene its solemnity its gloom its sadness its horror and withal its sweetness even a sceptic who can see nothing but a travesty of bitter truth in anything holy or emotional would have been melted to the heart had he seen that little group of loving and devoted friends kneeling round that stricken and sorrowing lady or heard the tender passion of her husbands voice as in tones so broken with emotion that often he had to pause he read the simple and beautiful service from the burial of the dead ii cannot go onwordsandvvoiceffail mme ,Dracula
she was right in her instinct strange as it all was bizarre as it may hereafter seem even to us who felt its potent influence at the time it comforted us much and the silence which showed mrs harkers coming relapse from her freedom of soul did not seem so full of despair to any of us as we had dreaded ,Dracula
 october varnawe left charing cross on the morning of the th got to paris the same night and took the places secured for us in the orient express we travelled night and day arriving here at about five oclock lord godalming went to the consulate to see if any telegram had arrived for him whilst the rest of us came on to this hotelthe odessus the journey may have had incidents i was however too eager to get on to care for them until the czarina catherine comes into port there will be no interest for me in anything in the wide world thank god mina is well and looks to be getting stronger her colour is coming back she sleeps a great deal throughout the journey she slept nearly all the time before sunrise and sunset however she is very wakeful and alert and it has become a habit for van helsing to hypnotise her at such times at first some effort was needed and he had to make many passes but now she seems to yield at once as if by habit and scarcely any action is needed he seems to have power at these particular moments to simply will and her thoughts obey him he always asks her what she can see and hear she answers to the first ,Dracula
i can hear the waves lapping against the ship and the water rushing by canvas and cordage strain and masts and yards creak the wind is highi can hear it in the shrouds and the bow throws back the foam it is evident that the czarina catherine is still at sea hastening on her way to varna lord godalming has just returned he had four telegrams one each day since we started and all to the same effect that the czarina catherine had not been reported to lloyds from anywhere he had arranged before leaving london that his agent should send him every day a telegram saying if the ship had been reported he was to have a message even if she were not reported so that he might be sure that there was a watch being kept at the other end of the wire ,Dracula
we had dinner and went to bed early tomorrow we are to see the viceconsul and to arrange if we can about getting on board the ship as soon as she arrives van helsing says that our chance will be to get on the boat between sunrise and sunset the count even if he takes the form of a bat cannot cross the running water of his own volition and so cannot leave the ship as he dare not change to mans form without suspicionwhich he evidently wishes to avoidhe must remain in the box if then we can come on board after sunrise he is at our mercy for we can open the box and make sure of him as we did of poor lucy before he wakes what mercy he shall get from us will not count for much we think that we shall not have much trouble with officials or the seamen thank god this is the country where bribery can do anything and we are well supplied with money we have only to make sure that the ship cannot come into port between sunset and sunrise without our being warned and we shall be safe judge moneybag will settle this case i think ,Dracula
 octoberminas report still the same lapping waves and rushing water darkness and favouring winds we are evidently in good time and when we hear of the czarina catherine we shall be ready as she must pass the dardanelles we are sure to have some report ,Dracula
 octobereverything is pretty well fixed now i think to welcome the count on his return from his tour godalming told the shippers that he fancied that the box sent aboard might contain something stolen from a friend of his and got a half consent that he might open it at his own risk the owner gave him a paper telling the captain to give him every facility in doing whatever he chose on board the ship and also a similar authorisation to his agent at varna we have seen the agent who was much impressed with godalmings kindly manner to him and we are all satisfied that whatever he can do to aid our wishes will be done we have already arranged what to do in case we get the box open if the count is there van helsing and seward will cut off his head at once and drive a stake through his heart morris and godalming and i shall prevent interference even if we have to use the arms which we shall have ready the professor says that if we can so treat the counts body it will soon after fall into dust in such case there would be no evidence against us in case any suspicion of murder were aroused but even if it were not we should stand or fall by our act and perhaps some day this very script may be evidence to come between some of us and a rope for myself i should take the chance only too thankfully if it were to come we mean to leave no stone unturned to carry out our intent we have arranged with certain officials that the instant the czarina catherine is seen we are to be informed by a special messenger ,Dracula
 octobera whole week of waiting daily telegrams to godalming but only the same story not yet reported minas morning and evening hypnotic answer is unvaried lapping waves rushing water and creaking masts ,Dracula
 octoberhow i miss my phonograph to write diary with a pen is irksome to me but van helsing says i must we were all wild with excitement yesterday when godalming got his telegram from lloyds i know now what men feel in battle when the call to action is heard mrs harker alone of our party did not show any signs of emotion after all it is not strange that she did not for we took special care not to let her know anything about it and we all tried not to show any excitement when we were in her presence in old days she would i am sure have noticed no matter how we might have tried to conceal it but in this way she is greatly changed during the past three weeks the lethargy grows upon her and though she seems strong and well and is getting back some of her colour van helsing and i are not satisfied we talk of her often we have not however said a word to the others it would break poor harkers heartcertainly his nerveif he knew that we had even a suspicion on the subject van helsing examines he tells me her teeth very carefully whilst she is in the hypnotic condition for he says that so long as they do not begin to sharpen there is no active danger of a change in her if this change should come it would be necessary to take steps we both know what those steps would have to be though we do not mention our thoughts to each other we should neither of us shrink from the taskawful though it be to contemplate euthanasia is an excellent and a comforting word i am grateful to whoever invented it ,Dracula
it is only about  hours sail from the dardanelles to here at the rate the czarina catherine has come from london she should therefore arrive some time in the morning but as she cannot possibly get in before then we are all about to retire early we shall get up at one oclock so as to be ready ,Dracula
 october noonno news yet of the ships arrival mrs harkers hypnotic report this morning was the same as usual so it is possible that we may get news at any moment we men are all in a fever of excitement except harker who is calm his hands are cold as ice and an hour ago i found him whetting the edge of the great ghoorka knife which he now always carries with him it will be a bad lookout for the count if the edge of that kukri ever touches his throat driven by that stern icecold hand ,Dracula
van helsing and i were a little alarmed about mrs harker today about noon she got into a sort of lethargy which we did not like although we kept silence to the others we were neither of us happy about it she had been restless all the morning so that we were at first glad to know that she was sleeping when however her husband mentioned casually that she was sleeping so soundly that he could not wake her we went to her room to see for ourselves she was breathing naturally and looked so well and peaceful that we agreed that the sleep was better for her than anything else poor girl she has so much to forget that it is no wonder that sleep if it brings oblivion to her does her good ,Dracula
laterour opinion was justified for when after a refreshing sleep of some hours she woke up she seemed brighter and better than she had been for days at sunset she made the usual hypnotic report wherever he may be in the black sea the count is hurrying to his destination to his doom i trust ,Dracula
 octoberanother day and no tidings of the czarina catherine she ought to be here by now that she is still journeying somewhere is apparent for mrs harkers hypnotic report at sunrise was still the same it is possible that the vessel may be lying by at times for fog some of the steamers which came in last evening reported patches of fog both to north and south of the port we must continue our watching as the ship may now be signalled any moment ,Dracula
 october noonmost strange no news yet of the ship we wait for mrs harker reported last night and this morning as usual lapping waves and rushing water though she added that the waves were very faint the telegrams from london have been the same no further report van helsing is terribly anxious and told me just now that he fears the count is escaping us he added significantly ,Dracula
i did not like that lethargy of madam minas souls and memories can do strange things during trance i was about to ask him more but harker just then came in and he held up a warning hand we must try tonight at sunset to make her speak more fully when in her hypnotic state ,Dracula
 octoberwhen the telegram came announcing the arrival in galatz i do not think it was such a shock to any of us as might have been expected true we did not know whence or how or when the bolt would come but i think we all expected that something strange would happen the delay of arrival at varna made us individually satisfied that things would not be just as we had expected we only waited to learn where the change would occur none the less however was it a surprise i suppose that nature works on such a hopeful basis that we believe against ourselves that things will be as they ought to be not as we should know that they will be transcendentalism is a beacon to the angels even if it be a willothewisp to man it was an odd experience and we all took it differently van helsing raised his hand over his head for a moment as though in remonstrance with the almighty but he said not a word and in a few seconds stood up with his face sternly set lord godalming grew very pale and sat breathing heavily i was myself half stunned and looked in wonder at one after another quincey morris tightened his belt with that quick movement which i knew so well in our old wandering days it meant action mrs harker grew ghastly white so that the scar on her forehead seemed to burn but she folded her hands meekly and looked up in prayer harker smiledactually smiledthe dark bitter smile of one who is without hope but at the same time his action belied his words for his hands instinctively sought the hilt of the great kukri knife and rested there when does the next train start for galatz said van helsing to us generally ,Dracula
you forgetor perhaps you do not know though jonathan does and so does dr van helsingthat i am the train fiend at home in exeter i always used to make up the timetables so as to be helpful to my husband i found it so useful sometimes that i always make a study of the timetables now i knew that if anything were to take us to castle dracula we should go by galatz or at any rate through bucharest so i learned the times very carefully unhappily there are not many to learn as the only train tomorrow leaves as i say ,Dracula
cant we get a special asked lord godalming van helsing shook his head i fear not this land is very different from yours or mine even if we did have a special it would probably not arrive as soon as our regular train moreover we have something to prepare we must think now let us organize you friend arthur go to the train and get the tickets and arrange that all be ready for us to go in the morning do you friend jonathan go to the agent of the ship and get from him letters to the agent in galatz with authority to make search the ship just as it was here morris quincey you see the viceconsul and get his aid with his fellow in galatz and all he can do to make our way smooth so that no times be lost when over the danube john will stay with madam mina and me and we shall consult for so if time be long you may be delayed and it will not matter when the sun set since i am here with madam to make report ,Dracula
and i said mrs harker brightly and more like her old self than she had been for many a long day shall try to be of use in all ways and shall think and write for you as i used to do something is shifting from me in some strange way and i feel freer than i have been of late the three younger men looked happier at the moment as they seemed to realise the significance of her words but van helsing and i turning to each other met each a grave and troubled glance we said nothing at the time however ,Dracula
when the three men had gone out to their tasks van helsing asked mrs harker to look up the copy of the diaries and find him the part of harkers journal at the castle she went away to get it when the door was shut upon her he said to me ,Dracula
you are in part right friend john but only in part i want to tell you something and oh my friend i am taking a greata terriblerisk but i believe it is right in the moment when madam mina said those words that arrest both our understanding an inspiration came to me in the trance of three days ago the count sent her his spirit to read her mind or more like he took her to see him in his earthbox in the ship with water rushing just as it go free at rise and set of sun he learn then that we are here for she have more to tell in her open life with eyes to see and ears to hear than he shut as he is in his coffinbox now he make his most effort to escape us at present he want her not ,Dracula
he is sure with his so great knowledge that she will come at his call but he cut her offtake her as he can do out of his own power that so she come not to him ah there i have hope that our manbrains that have been of man so long and that have not lost the grace of god will come higher than his childbrain that lie in his tomb for centuries that grow not yet to our stature and that do only work selfish and therefore small here comes madam mina not a word to her of her trance she know it not and it would overwhelm her and make despair just when we want all her hope all her courage when most we want all her great brain which is trained like mans brain but is of sweet woman and have a special power which the count give her and which he may not take away altogetherthough he think not so hush let me speak and you shall learn oh john my friend we are in awful straits i fear as i never feared before we can only trust the good god silence here she comes ,Dracula
i thought that the professor was going to break down and have hysterics just as he had when lucy died but with a great effort he controlled himself and was at perfect nervous poise when mrs harker tripped into the room bright and happylooking and in the doing of work seemingly forgetful of her misery as she came in she handed a number of sheets of typewriting to van helsing he looked over them gravely his face brightening up as he read then holding the pages between his finger and thumb he said ,Dracula
friend john to you with so much of experience alreadyand you too dear madam mina that are younghere is a lesson do not fear ever to think a halfthought has been buzzing often in my brain but i fear to let him loose his wings here now with more knowledge i go back to where that halfthought come from and i find that he be no halfthought at all that be a whole thought though so young that he is not yet strong to use his little wings nay like the ugly duck of my friend hans andersen he be no duckthought at all but a big swanthought that sail nobly on big wings when the time come for him to try them see i read here what jonathan have written ,Dracula
that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkey land who when he was beaten back came again and again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph ,Dracula
what does this tell us not much no the counts childthought see nothing therefore he speak so free your manthought see nothing my manthought see nothing till just now no but there comes another word from some one who speak without thought because she too know not what it meanwhat it might mean just as there are elements which rest yet when in natures course they move on their way and they touchthen pouf and there comes a flash of light heaven wide that blind and kill and destroy some but that show up all earth below for leagues and leagues is it not so well i shall explain to begin have you ever study the philosophy of crime yes and no you john yes for it is a study of insanity you no madam mina for crime touch you notnot but once still your mind works true and argues not a particulari ad universale there is this peculiarity in criminals it is so constant in all countries and at all times that even police who know not much from philosophy come to know it empirically that it is that is to be empiric the criminal always work at one crimethat is the true criminal who seems predestinate to crime and who will of none other this criminal has not full manbrain he is clever and cunning and resourceful but he be not of manstature as to brain he be of childbrain in much now this criminal of ours is predestinate to crime also he too have childbrain and it is of the child to do what he have done the little bird the little fish the little animal learn not by principle but empirically and when he learn to do then there is to him the ground to start from to do more dos pou sto said archimedes give me a fulcrum and i shall move the world to do once is the fulcrum whereby childbrain become manbrain and until he have the purpose to do more he continue to do the same again every time just as he have done before oh my dear i see that your eyes are opened and that to you the lightning flash show all the leagues for mrs harker began to clap her hands and her eyes sparkled he went on ,Dracula
now you shall speak tell us two dry men of science what you see with those so bright eyes he took her hand and held it whilst she spoke his finger and thumb closed on her pulse as i thought instinctively and unconsciously as she spoke ,Dracula
the count is a criminal and of criminal type nordau and lombroso would so classify him and qu criminal he is of imperfectly formed mind thus in a difficulty he has to seek resource in habit his past is a clue and the one page of it that we knowand that from his own lipstells that once before when in what mr morris would call a tight place he went back to his own country from the land he had tried to invade and thence without losing purpose prepared himself for a new effort he came again better equipped for his work and won so he came to london to invade a new land he was beaten and when all hope of success was lost and his existence in danger he fled back over the sea to his home just as formerly he had fled back over the danube from turkey land ,Dracula
good good oh you so clever lady said van helsing enthusiastically as he stooped and kissed her hand a moment later he said to me as calmly as though we had been having a sickroom consultation ,Dracula
then as he is criminal he is selfish and as his intellect is small and his action is based on selfishness he confines himself to one purpose that purpose is remorseless as he fled back over the danube leaving his forces to be cut to pieces so now he is intent on being safe careless of all so his own selfishness frees my soul somewhat from the terrible power which he acquired over me on that dreadful night i felt it oh i felt it thank god for his great mercy my soul is freer than it has been since that awful hour and all that haunts me is a fear lest in some trance or dream he may have used my knowledge for his ends the professor stood up ,Dracula
he has so used your mind and by it he has left us here in varna whilst the ship that carried him rushed through enveloping fog up to galatz where doubtless he had made preparation for escaping from us but his childmind only saw so far and it may be that as ever is in gods providence the very thing that the evildoer most reckoned on for his selfish good turns out to be his chiefest harm the hunter is taken in his own snare as the great psalmist says for now that he think he is free from every trace of us all and that he has escaped us with so many hours to him then his selfish childbrain will whisper him to sleep he think too that as he cut himself off from knowing your mind there can be no knowledge of him to you there is where he fail that terrible baptism of blood which he give you makes you free to go to him in spirit as you have as yet done in your times of freedom when the sun rise and set at such times you go by my volition and not by his and this power to good of you and others as you have won from your suffering at his hands this is now all the more precious that he know it not and to guard himself have even cut himself off from his knowledge of our where we however are not selfish and we believe that god is with us through all this blackness and these many dark hours we shall follow him and we shall not flinch even if we peril ourselves that we become like him friend john this has been a great hour and it have done much to advance us on our way you must be scribe and write him all down so that when the others return from their work you can give it to them then they shall know as we do ,Dracula
 octoberthis is written in the train from varna to galatz last night we all assembled a little before the time of sunset each of us had done his work as well as he could so far as thought and endeavour and opportunity go we are prepared for the whole of our journey and for our work when we get to galatz when the usual time came round mrs harker prepared herself for her hypnotic effort and after a longer and more serious effort on the part of van helsing than has been usually necessary she sank into the trance usually she speaks on a hint but this time the professor had to ask her questions and to ask them pretty resolutely before we could learn anything at last her answer came ,Dracula
i can see nothing we are still there are no waves lapping but only a steady swirl of water softly running against the hawser i can hear mens voices calling near and far and the roll and creak of oars in the rowlocks a gun is fired somewhere the echo of it seems far away there is tramping of feet overhead and ropes and chains are dragged along what is this there is a gleam of light i can feel the air blowing upon me ,Dracula
here she stopped she had risen as if impulsively from where she lay on the sofa and raised both her hands palms upwards as if lifting a weight van helsing and i looked at each other with understanding quincey raised his eyebrows slightly and looked at her intently whilst harkers hand instinctively closed round the hilt of his kukri there was a long pause we all knew that the time when she could speak was passing but we felt that it was useless to say anything suddenly she sat up and as she opened her eyes said sweetly ,Dracula
you see my friends he is close to land he has left his earthchest but he has yet to get on shore in the night he may lie hidden somewhere but if he be not carried on shore or if the ship do not touch it he cannot achieve the land in such case he can if it be in the night change his form and can jump or fly on shore as he did at whitby but if the day come before he get on shore then unless he be carried he cannot escape and if he be carried then the customs men may discover what the box contain thus in fine if he escape not on shore tonight or before dawn there will be the whole day lost to him we may then arrive in time for if he escape not at night we shall come on him in daytime boxed up and at our mercy for he dare not be his true self awake and visible lest he be discovered ,Dracula
early this morning we listened with breathless anxiety for her response in her trance the hypnotic stage was even longer in coming than before and when it came the time remaining until full sunrise was so short that we began to despair van helsing seemed to throw his whole soul into the effort at last in obedience to his will she made reply ,Dracula
and so it is that we are travelling towards galatz in an agony of expectation we are due to arrive between two and three in the morning but already at bucharest we are three hours late so we cannot possibly get in till well after sunup thus we shall have two more hypnotic messages from mrs harker either or both may possibly throw more light on what is happening ,Dracula
latersunset has come and gone fortunately it came at a time when there was no distraction for had it occurred whilst we were at a station we might not have secured the necessary calm and isolation mrs harker yielded to the hypnotic influence even less readily than this morning i am in fear that her power of reading the counts sensations may die away just when we want it most it seems to me that her imagination is beginning to work whilst she has been in the trance hitherto she has confined herself to the simplest of facts if this goes on it may ultimately mislead us if i thought that the counts power over her would die away equally with her power of knowledge it would be a happy thought but i am afraid that it may not be so when she did speak her words were enigmatical ,Dracula
something is going out i can feel it pass me like a cold wind i can hear far off confused soundsas of men talking in strange tongues fiercefalling water and the howling of wolves she stopped and a shudder ran through her increasing in intensity for a few seconds till at the end she shook as though in a palsy she said no more even in answer to the professors imperative questioning when she woke from the trance she was cold and exhausted and languid but her mind was all alert she could not remember anything but asked what she had said when she was told she pondered over it deeply for a long time and in silence ,Dracula
 october  a mwe are near galatz now and i may not have time to write later sunrise this morning was anxiously looked for by us all knowing of the increasing difficulty of procuring the hypnotic trance van helsing began his passes earlier than usual they produced no effect however until the regular time when she yielded with a still greater difficulty only a minute before the sun rose the professor lost no time in his questioning her answer came with equal quickness ,Dracula
go on go on speak i command you said van helsing in an agonised voice at the same time there was despair in his eyes for the risen sun was reddening even mrs harkers pale face she opened her eyes and we all started as she said sweetly and seemingly with the utmost unconcern ,Dracula
what have i said what have i done i know nothing only that i was lying here half asleep and heard you say go on speak i command you it seemed so funny to hear you order me about as if i were a bad child ,Dracula
oh madam mina he said sadly it is proof if proof be needed of how i love and honour you when a word for your good spoken more earnest than ever can seem so strange because it is to order her whom i am proud to obey ,Dracula
 octobermr morris took me to the hotel where our rooms had been ordered by telegraph he being the one who could best be spared since he does not speak any foreign language the forces were distributed much as they had been at varna except that lord godalming went to the viceconsul as his rank might serve as an immediate guarantee of some sort to the official we being in extreme hurry jonathan and the two doctors went to the shipping agent to learn particulars of the arrival of the czarina catherine ,Dracula
 octoberat nine oclock dr van helsing dr seward and i called on messrs mackenzie  steinkoff the agents of the london firm of hapgood they had received a wire from london in answer to lord godalmings telegraphed request asking us to show them any civility in their power they were more than kind and courteous and took us at once on board the czarina catherine which lay at anchor out in the river harbour there we saw the captain donelson by name who told us of his voyage he said that in all his life he had never had so favourable a run ,Dracula
man he said but it made us afeard for we expeckit that we should have to pay for it wi some rare piece o ill luck so as to keep up the average its no canny to run frae london to the black sea wi a wind ahint ye as though the deil himself were blawin on yer sail for his ain purpose an a the time we could no speer a thing gin we were nigh a ship or a port or a headland a fog fell on us and travelled wi us till when after it had lifted and we looked out the deil a thing could we see we ran by gibraltar wioot bein able to signal an till we came to the dardanelles and had to wait to get our permit to pass we never were within hail o aught at first i inclined to slack off sail and beat about till the fog was lifted but whiles i thocht that if the deil was minded to get us into the black sea quick he was like to do it whether we would or no if we had a quick voyage it would be no to our miscredit wi the owners or no hurt to our traffic an the old mon who had served his ain purpose wad be decently grateful to us for no hinderin him this mixture of simplicity and cunning of superstition and commercial reasoning aroused van helsing who said ,Dracula
when we got past the bosphorus the men began to grumble some o them the roumanians came and asked me to heave overboard a big box which had been put on board by a queer lookin old man just before we had started frae london i had seen them speer at the fellow and put out their twa fingers when they saw him to guard against the evil eye man but the supersteetion of foreigners is pairfectly rideeculous i sent them aboot their business pretty quick but as just after a fog closed in on us i felt a wee bit as they did anent something though i wouldnt say it was agin the big box well on we went and as the fog didnt let up for five days i joost let the wind carry us for if the deil wanted to get somewhereswell he would fetch it up areet an if he didnt well wed keep a sharp lookout anyhow sure eneuch we had a fair way and deep water all the time and two days ago when the mornin sun came through the fog we found ourselves just in the river opposite galatz the roumanians were wild and wanted me right or wrong to take out the box and fling it in the river i had to argy wi them aboot it wi a handspike an when the last o them rose off the deck wi his head in his hand i had convinced them that evil eye or no evil eye the property and the trust of my owners were better in my hands than in the river danube they had mind ye taken the box on the deck ready to fling in and as it was marked galatz via varna i thocht id let it lie till we discharged in the port an get rid ot althegither we didnt do much clearin that day an had to remain the nicht at anchor but in the mornin braw an airly an hour before sunup a man came aboard wi an order written to him from england to receive a box marked for one count dracula sure eneuch the matter was one ready to his hand he had his papers a reet an glad i was to be rid o the dam thing for i was beginnin masel to feel uneasy at it if the deil did have any luggage aboord the ship im thinkin it was nane ither than that same ,Dracula
ill be tellin ye quick he answered and stepping down to his cabin produced a receipt signed immanuel hildesheim burgenstrasse  was the address we found out that this was all the captain knew so with thanks we came away ,Dracula
we found hildesheim in his office a hebrew of rather the adelphi theatre type with a nose like a sheep and a fez his arguments were pointed with speciewe doing the punctuationand with a little bargaining he told us what he knew this turned out to be simple but important he had received a letter from mr de ville of london telling him to receive if possible before sunrise so as to avoid customs a box which would arrive at galatz in the czarina catherine this he was to give in charge to a certain petrof skinsky who dealt with the slovaks who traded down the river to the port he had been paid for his work by an english bank note which had been duly cashed for gold at the danube international bank when skinsky had come to him he had taken him to the ship and handed over the box so as to save porterage that was all he knew ,Dracula
we then sought for skinsky but were unable to find him one of his neighbours who did not seem to bear him any affection said that he had gone away two days before no one knew whither this was corroborated by his landlord who had received by messenger the key of the house together with the rent due in english money this had been between ten and eleven oclock last night we were at a standstill again ,Dracula
whilst we were talking one came running and breathlessly gasped out that the body of skinsky had been found inside the wall of the churchyard of st peter and that the throat had been torn open as if by some wild animal those we had been speaking with ran off to see the horror the women crying out this is the work of a slovak we hurried away lest we should have been in some way drawn into the affair and so detained ,Dracula
as we came home we could arrive at no definite conclusion we were all convinced that the box was on its way by water to somewhere but where that might be we would have to discover with heavy hearts we came home to the hotel to mina ,Dracula
when we met together the first thing was to consult as to taking mina again into our confidence things are getting desperate and it is at least a chance though a hazardous one as a preliminary step i was released from my promise to her ,Dracula
 october eveningthey were so tired and worn out and dispirited that there was nothing to be done till they had some rest so i asked them all to lie down for half an hour whilst i should enter everything up to the moment i feel so grateful to the man who invented the travellers typewriter and to mr morris for getting this one for me i should have felt quite astray doing the work if i had to write with a pen ,Dracula
it is all done poor dear dear jonathan what he must have suffered what must he be suffering now he lies on the sofa hardly seeming to breathe and his whole body appears in collapse his brows are knit his face is drawn with pain poor fellow maybe he is thinking and i can see his face all wrinkled up with the concentration of his thoughts oh if i could only help at all i shall do what i can ,Dracula
i have asked dr van helsing and he has got me all the papers that i have not yet seen whilst they are resting i shall go over all carefully and perhaps i may arrive at some conclusion i shall try to follow the professors example and think without prejudice on the facts before me ,Dracula
a he must be brought back by some one this is evident for had he power to move himself as he wished he could go either as man or wolf or bat or in some other way he evidently fears discovery or interference in the state of helplessness in which he must beconfined as he is between dawn and sunset in his wooden box ,Dracula
 by railthere is no one in charge of the box it would have to take its chance of being delayed and delay would be fatal with enemies on the track true he might escape at night but what would he be if left in a strange place with no refuge that he could fly to this is not what he intends and he does not mean to risk it ,Dracula
 by waterhere is the safest way in one respect but with most danger in another on the water he is powerless except at night even then he can only summon fog and storm and snow and his wolves but were he wrecked the living water would engulf him helpless and he would indeed be lost he could have the vessel drive to land but if it were unfriendly land wherein he was not free to move his position would still be desperate ,Dracula
as to the first he evidently intended to arrive at galatz and sent invoice to varna to deceive us lest we should ascertain his means of exit from england his immediate and sole purpose then was to escape the proof of this is the letter of instructions sent to immanuel hildesheim to clear and take away the box before sunrise there is also the instruction to petrof skinsky these we must only guess at but there must have been some letter or message since skinsky came to hildesheim ,Dracula
that so far his plans were successful we know the czarina catherine made a phenomenally quick journeyso much so that captain donelsons suspicions were aroused but his superstition united with his canniness played the counts game for him and he ran with his favouring wind through fogs and all till he brought up blindfold at galatz that the counts arrangements were well made has been proved hildesheim cleared the box took it off and gave it to skinsky skinsky took itand here we lose the trail we only know that the box is somewhere on the water moving along the customs and the octroi if there be any have been avoided ,Dracula
the box was given to skinsky before sunrise at sunrise the count could appear in his own form here we ask why skinsky was chosen at all to aid in the work in my husbands diary skinsky is mentioned as dealing with the slovaks who trade down the river to the port and the mans remark that the murder was the work of a slovak showed the general feeling against his class the count wanted isolation ,Dracula
my surmise is this that in london the count decided to get back to his castle by water as the most safe and secret way he was brought from the castle by szgany and probably they delivered their cargo to slovaks who took the boxes to varna for there they were shipped for london thus the count had knowledge of the persons who could arrange this service when the box was on land before sunrise or after sunset he came out from his box met skinsky and instructed him what to do as to arranging the carriage of the box up some river when this was done and he knew that all was in train he blotted out his traces as he thought by murdering his agent ,Dracula
i have examined the map and find that the river most suitable for the slovaks to have ascended is either the pruth or the sereth i read in the typescript that in my trance i heard cows low and water swirling level with my ears and the creaking of wood the count in his box then was on a river in an open boatpropelled probably either by oars or poles for the banks are near and it is working against stream there would be no such sound if floating down stream ,Dracula
of course it may not be either the sereth or the pruth but we may possibly investigate further now of these two the pruth is the more easily navigated but the sereth is at fundu joined by the bistritza which runs up round the borgo pass the loop it makes is manifestly as close to draculas castle as can be got by water ,Dracula
our dear madam mina is once more our teacher her eyes have been where we were blinded now we are on the track once again and this time we may succeed our enemy is at his most helpless and if we can come on him by day on the water our task will be over he has a start but he is powerless to hasten as he may not leave his box lest those who carry him may suspect for them to suspect would be to prompt them to throw him in the stream where he perish this he knows and will not now men to our council of war for here and now we must plan what each and all shall do ,Dracula
good said the professor both good but neither must go alone there must be force to overcome force if need be the slovak is strong and rough and he carries rude arms all the men smiled for amongst them they carried a small arsenal said mr morris ,Dracula
i have brought some winchesters they are pretty handy in a crowd and there may be wolves the count if you remember took some other precautions he made some requisitions on others that mrs harker could not quite hear or understand we must be ready at all points dr seward said ,Dracula
i think i had better go with quincey we have been accustomed to hunt together and we two well armed will be a match for whatever may come along you must not be alone art it may be necessary to fight the slovaks and a chance thrustfor i dont suppose these fellows carry gunswould undo all our plans there must be no chances this time we shall not rest until the counts head and body have been separated and we are sure that he cannot reincarnate he looked at jonathan as he spoke and jonathan looked at me i could see that the poor dear was torn about in his mind of course he wanted to be with me but then the boat service would most likely be the one which would destroy the  the  the  vampire why did i hesitate to write the word he was silent awhile and during his silence dr van helsing spoke ,Dracula
friend jonathan this is to you for twice reasons first because you are young and brave and can fight and all energies may be needed at the last and again that it is your right to destroy himthatwhich has wrought such woe to you and yours be not afraid for madam mina she will be my care if i may i am old my legs are not so quick to run as once and i am not used to ride so long or to pursue as need be or to fight with lethal weapons but i can be of other service i can fight in other way and i can die if need be as well as younger men now let me say that what i would is this while you my lord godalming and friend jonathan go in your so swift little steamboat up the river and whilst john and quincey guard the bank where perchance he might be landed i will take madam mina right into the heart of the enemys country whilst the old fox is tied in his box floating on the running stream whence he cannot escape to landwhere he dares not raise the lid of his coffinbox lest his slovak carriers should in fear leave him to perishwe shall go in the track where jonathan wentfrom bistritz over the borgo and find our way to the castle of dracula here madam minas hypnotic power will surely help and we shall find our wayall dark and unknown otherwiseafter the first sunrise when we are near that fateful place there is much to be done and other places to be made sanctify so that that nest of vipers be obliterated here jonathan interrupted him hotly ,Dracula
do you mean to say professor van helsing that you would bring mina in her sad case and tainted as she is with that devils illness right into the jaws of his deathtrap not for the world not for heaven or hell he became almost speechless for a minute and then went on ,Dracula
do you know what the place is have you seen that awful den of hellish infamywith the very moonlight alive with grisly shapes and every speck of dust that whirls in the wind a devouring monster in embryo have you felt the vampires lips upon your throat here he turned to me and as his eyes lit on my forehead he threw up his arms with a cry oh my god what have we done to have this terror upon us and he sank down on the sofa in a collapse of misery the professors voice as he spoke in clear sweet tones which seemed to vibrate in the air calmed us all ,Dracula
oh my friend it is because i would save madam mina from that awful place that i would go god forbid that i should take her into that place there is workwild workto be done there that her eyes may not see we men here all save jonathan have seen with their own eyes what is to be done before that place can be purify remember that we are in terrible straits if the count escape us this timeand he is strong and subtle and cunninghe may choose to sleep him for a century and then in time our dear onehe took my handwould come to him to keep him company and would be as those others that you jonathan saw you have told us of their gloating lips you heard their ribald laugh as they clutched the moving bag that the count threw to them you shudder and well may it be forgive me that i make you so much pain but it is necessary my friend is it not a dire need for the which i am giving possibly my life if it were that any one went into that place to stay it is i who would have to go to keep them company ,Dracula
lateroh it did me good to see the way that these brave men worked how can women help loving men when they are so earnest and so true and so brave and too it made me think of the wonderful power of money what can it not do when it is properly applied and what might it do when basely used i felt so thankful that lord godalming is rich and that both he and mr morris who also has plenty of money are willing to spend it so freely for if they did not our little expedition could not start either so promptly or so well equipped as it will within another hour it is not three hours since it was arranged what part each of us was to do and now lord godalming and jonathan have a lovely steam launch with steam up ready to start at a moments notice dr seward and mr morris have half a dozen good horses well appointed we have all the maps and appliances of various kinds that can be had professor van helsing and i are to leave by the  train tonight for veresti where we are to get a carriage to drive to the borgo pass we are bringing a good deal of ready money as we are to buy a carriage and horses we shall drive ourselves for we have no one whom we can trust in the matter the professor knows something of a great many languages so we shall get on all right we have all got arms even for me a largebore revolver jonathan would not be happy unless i was armed like the rest alas i cannot carry one arm that the rest do the scar on my forehead forbids that dear dr van helsing comforts me by telling me that i am fully armed as there may be wolves the weather is getting colder every hour and there are snowflurries which come and go as warnings ,Dracula
laterit took all my courage to say goodbye to my darling we may never meet again courage mina the professor is looking at you keenly his look is a warning there must be no tears nowunless it may be that god will let them fall in gladness ,Dracula
october  nighti am writing this in the light from the furnace door of the steam launch lord godalming is firing up he is an experienced hand at the work as he has had for years a launch of his own on the thames and another on the norfolk broads regarding our plans we finally decided that minas guess was correct and that if any waterway was chosen for the counts escape back to his castle the sereth and then the bistritza at its junction would be the one we took it that somewhere about the th degree north latitude would be the place chosen for the crossing the country between the river and the carpathians we have no fear in running at good speed up the river at night there is plenty of water and the banks are wide enough apart to make steaming even in the dark easy enough lord godalming tells me to sleep for a while as it is enough for the present for one to be on watch but i cannot sleephow can i with the terrible danger hanging over my darling and her going out into that awful place my only comfort is that we are in the hands of god only for that faith it would be easier to die than to live and so be quit of all the trouble mr morris and dr seward were off on their long ride before we started they are to keep up the right bank far enough off to get on higher lands where they can see a good stretch of river and avoid the following of its curves they have for the first stages two men to ride and lead their spare horsesfour in all so as not to excite curiosity when they dismiss the men which shall be shortly they shall themselves look after the horses it may be necessary for us to join forces if so they can mount our whole party one of the saddles has a movable horn and can be easily adapted for mina if required ,Dracula
it is a wild adventure we are on here as we are rushing along through the darkness with the cold from the river seeming to rise up and strike us with all the mysterious voices of the night around us it all comes home we seem to be drifting into unknown places and unknown ways into a whole world of dark and dreadful things godalming is shutting the furnace door ,Dracula
 octoberstill hurrying along the day has come and godalming is sleeping i am on watch the morning is bitterly cold the furnace heat is grateful though we have heavy fur coats as yet we have passed only a few open boats but none of them had on board any box or package of anything like the size of the one we seek the men were scared every time we turned our electric lamp on them and fell on their knees and prayed ,Dracula
 november eveningno news all day we have found nothing of the kind we seek we have now passed into the bistritza and if we are wrong in our surmise our chance is gone we have overhauled every boat big and little early this morning one crew took us for a government boat and treated us accordingly we saw in this a way of smoothing matters so at fundu where the bistritza runs into the sereth we got a roumanian flag which we now fly conspicuously with every boat which we have overhauled since then this trick has succeeded we have had every deference shown to us and not once any objection to whatever we chose to ask or do some of the slovaks tell us that a big boat passed them going at more than usual speed as she had a double crew on board this was before they came to fundu so they could not tell us whether the boat turned into the bistritza or continued on up the sereth at fundu we could not hear of any such boat so she must have passed there in the night i am feeling very sleepy the cold is perhaps beginning to tell upon me and nature must have rest some time godalming insists that he shall keep the first watch god bless him for all his goodness to poor dear mina and me ,Dracula
 november morningit is broad daylight that good fellow would not wake me he says it would have been a sin to for i slept peacefully and was forgetting my trouble it seems brutally selfish to me to have slept so long and let him watch all night but he was quite right i am a new man this morning and as i sit here and watch him sleeping i can do all that is necessary both as to minding the engine steering and keeping watch i can feel that my strength and energy are coming back to me i wonder where mina is now and van helsing they should have got to veresti about noon on wednesday it would take them some time to get the carriage and horses so if they had started and travelled hard they would be about now at the borgo pass god guide and help them i am afraid to think what may happen if we could only go faster but we cannot the engines are throbbing and doing their utmost i wonder how dr seward and mr morris are getting on there seem to be endless streams running down the mountains into this river but as none of them are very largeat present at all events though they are terrible doubtless in winter and when the snow meltsthe horsemen may not have met much obstruction i hope that before we get to strasba we may see them for if by that time we have not overtaken the count it may be necessary to take counsel together what to do next ,Dracula
 novemberthree days on the road no news and no time to write it if there had been for every moment is precious we have had only the rest needful for the horses but we are both bearing it wonderfully those adventurous days of ours are turning up useful we must push on we shall never feel happy till we get the launch in sight again ,Dracula
 novemberwe heard at fundu that the launch had gone up the bistritza i wish it wasnt so cold there are signs of snow coming and if it falls heavy it will stop us in such case we must get a sledge and go on russian fashion ,Dracula
 novembertoday we heard of the launch having been detained by an accident when trying to force a way up the rapids the slovak boats get up all right by aid of a rope and steering with knowledge some went up only a few hours before godalming is an amateur fitter himself and evidently it was he who put the launch in trim again finally they got up the rapids all right with local help and are off on the chase afresh i fear that the boat is not any better for the accident the peasantry tell us that after she got upon smooth water again she kept stopping every now and again so long as she was in sight we must push on harder than ever our help may be wanted soon ,Dracula
 octoberarrived at veresti at noon the professor tells me that this morning at dawn he could hardly hypnotise me at all and that all i could say was dark and quiet he is off now buying a carriage and horses he says that he will later on try to buy additional horses so that we may be able to change them on the way we have something more than  miles before us the country is lovely and most interesting if only we were under different conditions how delightful it would be to see it all if jonathan and i were driving through it alone what a pleasure it would be to stop and see people and learn something of their life and to fill our minds and memories with all the colour and picturesqueness of the whole wild beautiful country and the quaint people but alas ,Dracula
laterdr van helsing has returned he has got the carriage and horses we are to have some dinner and to start in an hour the landlady is putting us up a huge basket of provisions it seems enough for a company of soldiers the professor encourages her and whispers to me that it may be a week before we can get any good food again he has been shopping too and has sent home such a wonderful lot of fur coats and wraps and all sorts of warm things there will not be any chance of our being cold ,Dracula
we shall soon be off i am afraid to think what may happen to us we are truly in the hands of god he alone knows what may be and i pray him with all the strength of my sad and humble soul that he will watch over my beloved husband that whatever may happen jonathan may know that i loved him and honoured him more than i can say and that my latest and truest thought will be always for him ,Dracula
 novemberall day long we have travelled and at a good speed the horses seem to know that they are being kindly treated for they go willingly their full stage at best speed we have now had so many changes and find the same thing so constantly that we are encouraged to think that the journey will be an easy one dr van helsing is laconic he tells the farmers that he is hurrying to bistritz and pays them well to make the exchange of horses we get hot soup or coffee or tea and off we go it is a lovely country full of beauties of all imaginable kinds and the people are brave and strong and simple and seem full of nice qualities they are very very superstitious in the first house where we stopped when the woman who served us saw the scar on my forehead she crossed herself and put out two fingers towards me to keep off the evil eye i believe they went to the trouble of putting an extra amount of garlic into our food and i cant abide garlic ever since then i have taken care not to take off my hat or veil and so have escaped their suspicions we are travelling fast and as we have no driver with us to carry tales we go ahead of scandal but i daresay that fear of the evil eye will follow hard behind us all the way the professor seems tireless all day he would not take any rest though he made me sleep for a long spell at sunset time he hypnotised me and he says that i answered as usual darkness lapping water and creaking wood so our enemy is still on the river i am afraid to think of jonathan but somehow i have now no fear for him or for myself i write this whilst we wait in a farmhouse for the horses to be got ready dr van helsing is sleeping poor dear he looks very tired and old and grey but his mouth is set as firmly as a conquerors even in his sleep he is instinct with resolution when we have well started i must make him rest whilst i drive i shall tell him that we have days before us and we must not break down when most of all his strength will be needed all is ready we are off shortly ,Dracula
 november morningi was successful and we took turns driving all night now the day is on us bright though cold there is a strange heaviness in the airi say heaviness for want of a better word i mean that it oppresses us both it is very cold and only our warm furs keep us comfortable at dawn van helsing hypnotised me he says i answered darkness creaking wood and roaring water so the river is changing as they ascend i do hope that my darling will not run any chance of dangermore than need be but we are in gods hands ,Dracula
 november nightall day long driving the country gets wilder as we go and the great spurs of the carpathians which at veresti seemed so far from us and so low on the horizon now seem to gather round us and tower in front we both seem in good spirits i think we make an effort each to cheer the other in the doing so we cheer ourselves dr van helsing says that by morning we shall reach the borgo pass the houses are very few here now and the professor says that the last horse we got will have to go on with us as we may not be able to change he got two in addition to the two we changed so that now we have a rude fourinhand the dear horses are patient and good and they give us no trouble we are not worried with other travellers and so even i can drive we shall get to the pass in daylight we do not want to arrive before so we take it easy and have each a long rest in turn oh what will tomorrow bring to us we go to seek the place where my poor darling suffered so much god grant that we may be guided aright and that he will deign to watch over my husband and those dear to us both and who are in such deadly peril as for me i am not worthy in his sight alas i am unclean to his eyes and shall be until he may deign to let me stand forth in his sight as one of those who have not incurred his wrath ,Dracula
 novemberthis to my old and true friend john seward md of purfleet london in case i may not see him it may explain it is morning and i write by a fire which all the night i have kept alivemadam mina aiding me it is cold cold so cold that the grey heavy sky is full of snow which when it falls will settle for all winter as the ground is hardening to receive it it seems to have affected madam mina she has been so heavy of head all day that she was not like herself she sleeps and sleeps and sleeps she who is usual so alert have done literally nothing all the day she even have lost her appetite she make no entry into her little diary she who write so faithful at every pause something whisper to me that all is not well however tonight she is more vif her long sleep all day have refresh and restore her for now she is all sweet and bright as ever at sunset i try to hypnotise her but alas with no effect the power has grown less and less with each day and tonight it fail me altogether well gods will be donewhatever it may be and whithersoever it may lead ,Dracula
we got to the borgo pass just after sunrise yesterday morning when i saw the signs of the dawn i got ready for the hypnotism we stopped our carriage and got down so that there might be no disturbance i made a couch with furs and madam mina lying down yield herself as usual but more slow and more short time than ever to the hypnotic sleep as before came the answer darkness and the swirling of water then she woke bright and radiant and we go on our way and soon reach the pass at this time and place she become all on fire with zeal some new guiding power be in her manifested for she point to a road and say ,Dracula
at first i think somewhat strange but soon i see that there be only one such byroad it is used but little and very different from the coach road from the bukovina to bistritz which is more wide and hard and more of use ,Dracula
so we came down this road when we meet other waysnot always were we sure that they were roads at all for they be neglect and light snow have fallenthe horses know and they only i give rein to them and they go on so patient byandby we find all the things which jonathan have note in that wonderful diary of him then we go on for long long hours and hours at the first i tell madam mina to sleep she try and she succeed she sleep all the time till at the last i feel myself to suspicious grow and attempt to wake her but she sleep on and i may not wake her though i try i do not wish to try too hard lest i harm her for i know that she have suffer much and sleep at times be allinall to her i think i drowse myself for all of sudden i feel guilt as though i have done something i find myself bolt up with the reins in my hand and the good horses go along jog jog just as ever i look down and find madam mina still sleep it is now not far off sunset time and over the snow the light of the sun flow in big yellow flood so that we throw great long shadow on where the mountain rise so steep for we are going up and up and all is oh so wild and rocky as though it were the end of the world ,Dracula
then i arouse madam mina this time she wake with not much trouble and then i try to put her to hypnotic sleep but she sleep not being as though i were not still i try and try till all at once i find her and myself in dark so i look round and find that the sun have gone down madam mina laugh and i turn and look at her she is now quite awake and look so well as i never saw her since that night at carfax when we first enter the counts house i am amaze and not at ease then but she is so bright and tender and thoughtful for me that i forget all fear i light a fire for we have brought supply of wood with us and she prepare food while i undo the horses and set them tethered in shelter to feed then when i return to the fire she have my supper ready i go to help her but she smile and tell me that she have eat alreadythat she was so hungry that she would not wait i like it not and i have grave doubts but i fear to affright her and so i am silent of it she help me and i eat alone and then we wrap in fur and lie beside the fire and i tell her to sleep while i watch but presently i forget all of watching and when i sudden remember that i watch i find her lying quiet but awake and looking at me with so bright eyes once twice more the same occur and i get much sleep till before morning when i wake i try to hypnotise her but alas though she shut her eyes obedient she may not sleep the sun rise up and up and up and then sleep come to her too late but so heavy that she will not wake i have to lift her up and place her sleeping in the carriage when i have harnessed the horses and made all ready madam still sleep and she look in her sleep more healthy and more redder than before and i like it not and i am afraid afraid afraidi am afraid of all thingseven to think but i must go on my way the stake we play for is life and death or more than these and we must not flinch ,Dracula
 november morninglet me be accurate in everything for though you and i have seen some strange things together you may at the first think that i van helsing am madthat the many horrors and the so long strain on nerves has at the last turn my brain ,Dracula
all yesterday we travel ever getting closer to the mountains and moving into a more and more wild and desert land there are great frowning precipices and much falling water and nature seem to have held sometime her carnival madam mina still sleep and sleep and though i did have hunger and appeased it i could not waken hereven for food i began to fear that the fatal spell of the place was upon her tainted as she is with that vampire baptism well said i to myself if it be that she sleep all the day it shall also be that i do not sleep at night as we travel on the rough road for a road of an ancient and imperfect kind there was i held down my head and slept again i waked with a sense of guilt and of time passed and found madam mina still sleeping and the sun low down but all was indeed changed the frowning mountains seemed further away and we were near the top of a steeprising hill on summit of which was such a castle as jonathan tell of in his diary at once i exulted and feared for now for good or ill the end was near ,Dracula
i woke madam mina and again tried to hypnotise her but alas unavailing till too late then ere the great dark came upon usfor even after downsun the heavens reflected the gone sun on the snow and all was for a time in a great twilighti took out the horses and fed them in what shelter i could then i make a fire and near it i make madam mina now awake and more charming than ever sit comfortable amid her rugs i got ready food but she would not eat simply saying that she had not hunger i did not press her knowing her unavailingness but i myself eat for i must needs now be strong for all then with the fear on me of what might be i drew a ring so big for her comfort round where madam mina sat and over the ring i passed some of the wafer and i broke it fine so that all was well guarded she sat still all the timeso still as one dead and she grew whiter and ever whiter till the snow was not more pale and no word she said but when i drew near she clung to me and i could know that the poor soul shook her from head to feet with a tremor that was pain to feel i said to her presently when she had grown more quiet ,Dracula
presently the horses began to scream and tore at their tethers till i came to them and quieted them when they did feel my hands on them they whinnied low as in joy and licked at my hands and were quiet for a time many times through the night did i come to them till it arrive to the cold hour when all nature is at lowest and every time my coming was with quiet of them in the cold hour the fire began to die and i was about stepping forth to replenish it for now the snow came in flying sweeps and with it a chill mist even in the dark there was a light of some kind as there ever is over snow and it seemed as though the snowflurries and the wreaths of mist took shape as of women with trailing garments all was in dead grim silence only that the horses whinnied and cowered as if in terror of the worst i began to fearhorrible fears but then came to me the sense of safety in that ring wherein i stood i began too to think that my imaginings were of the night and the gloom and the unrest that i have gone through and all the terrible anxiety it was as though my memories of all jonathans horrid experience were befooling me for the snow flakes and the mist began to wheel and circle round till i could get as though a shadowy glimpse of those women that would have kissed him and then the horses cowered lower and lower and moaned in terror as men do in pain even the madness of fright was not to them so that they could break away i feared for my dear madam mina when these weird figures drew near and circled round i looked at her but she sat calm and smiled at me when i would have stepped to the fire to replenish it she caught me and held me back and whispered like a voice that one hears in a dream so low it was ,Dracula
fear for me why fear for me none safer in all the world from them than i am and as i wondered at the meaning of her words a puff of wind made the flame leap up and i see the red scar on her forehead then alas i knew did i not i would soon have learned for the wheeling figures of mist and snow came closer but keeping ever without the holy circle then they began to materialise tillif god have not take away my reason for i saw it through my eyesthere were before me in actual flesh the same three women that jonathan saw in the room when they would have kissed his throat i knew the swaying round forms the bright hard eyes the white teeth the ruddy colour the voluptuous lips they smiled ever at poor dear madam mina and as their laugh came through the silence of the night they twined their arms and pointed to her and said in those so sweet tingling tones that jonathan said were of the intolerable sweetness of the waterglasses ,Dracula
come sister come to us come come in fear i turned to my poor madam mina and my heart with gladness leapt like flame for oh the terror in her sweet eyes the repulsion the horror told a story to my heart that was all of hope god be thanked she was not yet of them i seized some of the firewood which was by me and holding out some of the wafer advanced on them towards the fire they drew back before me and laughed their low horrid laugh i fed the fire and feared them not for i knew that we were safe within our protections they could not approach me whilst so armed nor madam mina whilst she remained within the ring which she could not leave no more than they could enter the horses had ceased to moan and lay still on the ground the snow fell on them softly and they grew whiter i knew that there was for the poor beasts no more of terror ,Dracula
and so we remained till the red of the dawn to fall through the snowgloom i was desolate and afraid and full of woe and terror but when that beautiful sun began to climb the horizon life was to me again at the first coming of the dawn the horrid figures melted in the whirling mist and snow the wreaths of transparent gloom moved away towards the castle and were lost ,Dracula
instinctively with the dawn coming i turned to madam mina intending to hypnotise her but she lay in a deep and sudden sleep from which i could not wake her i tried to hypnotise through her sleep but she made no response none at all and the day broke i fear yet to stir i have made my fire and have seen the horses they are all dead today i have much to do here and i keep waiting till the sun is up high for there may be places where i must go where that sunlight though snow and mist obscure it will be to me a safety ,Dracula
 november eveningthe accident to the launch has been a terrible thing for us only for it we should have overtaken the boat long ago and by now my dear mina would have been free i fear to think of her off on the wolds near that horrid place we have got horses and we follow on the track i note this whilst godalming is getting ready we have our arms the szgany must look out if they mean fight oh if only morris and seward were with us we must only hope if i write no more goodbye mina god bless and keep you ,Dracula
 novemberwith the dawn we saw the body of szgany before us dashing away from the river with their leiterwagon they surrounded it in a cluster and hurried along as though beset the snow is falling lightly and there is a strange excitement in the air it may be our own feelings but the depression is strange far off i hear the howling of wolves the snow brings them down from the mountains and there are dangers to all of us and from all sides the horses are nearly ready and we are soon off we ride to death of some one god alone knows who or where or what or when or how it may be ,Dracula
 november afternooni am at least sane thank god for that mercy at all events though the proving it has been dreadful when i left madam mina sleeping within the holy circle i took my way to the castle the blacksmith hammer which i took in the carriage from veresti was useful though the doors were all open i broke them off the rusty hinges lest some illintent or illchance should close them so that being entered i might not get out jonathans bitter experience served me here by memory of his diary i found my way to the old chapel for i knew that here my work lay the air was oppressive it seemed as if there was some sulphurous fume which at times made me dizzy either there was a roaring in my ears or i heard afar off the howl of wolves then i bethought me of my dear madam mina and i was in terrible plight the dilemma had me between his horns ,Dracula
her i had not dare to take into this place but left safe from the vampire in that holy circle and yet even there would be the wolf i resolve me that my work lay here and that as to the wolves we must submit if it were gods will at any rate it was only death and freedom beyond so did i choose for her had it but been for myself the choice had been easy the maw of the wolf were better to rest in than the grave of the vampire so i make my choice to go on with my work ,Dracula
i knew that there were at least three graves to findgraves that are inhabit so i search and search and i find one of them she lay in her vampire sleep so full of life and voluptuous beauty that i shudder as though i have come to do murder ah i doubt not that in old time when such things were many a man who set forth to do such a task as mine found at the last his heart fail him and then his nerve so he delay and delay and delay till the mere beauty and the fascination of the wanton undead have hypnotise him and he remain on and on till sunset come and the vampire sleep be over then the beautiful eyes of the fair woman open and look love and the voluptuous mouth present to a kissand man is weak and there remain one more victim in the vampire fold one more to swell the grim and grisly ranks of the undead ,Dracula
there is some fascination surely when i am moved by the mere presence of such an one even lying as she lay in a tomb fretted with age and heavy with the dust of centuries though there be that horrid odour such as the lairs of the count have had yes i was movedi van helsing with all my purpose and with my motive for hatei was moved to a yearning for delay which seemed to paralyse my faculties and to clog my very soul it may have been that the need of natural sleep and the strange oppression of the air were beginning to overcome me certain it was that i was lapsing into sleep the openeyed sleep of one who yields to a sweet fascination when there came through the snowstilled air a long low wail so full of woe and pity that it woke me like the sound of a clarion for it was the voice of my dear madam mina that i heard ,Dracula
then i braced myself again to my horrid task and found by wrenching away tombtops one other of the sisters the other dark one i dared not pause to look on her as i had on her sister lest once more i should begin to be enthrall but i go on searching until presently i find in a high great tomb as if made to one much beloved that other fair sister which like jonathan i had seen to gather herself out of the atoms of the mist she was so fair to look on so radiantly beautiful so exquisitely voluptuous that the very instinct of man in me which calls some of my sex to love and to protect one of hers made my head whirl with new emotion but god be thanked that soulwail of my dear madam mina had not died out of my ears and before the spell could be wrought further upon me i had nerved myself to my wild work by this time i had searched all the tombs in the chapel so far as i could tell and as there had been only three of these undead phantoms around us in the night i took it that there were no more of active undead existent there was one great tomb more lordly than all the rest huge it was and nobly proportioned on it was but one word ,Dracula
this then was the undead home of the kingvampire to whom so many more were due its emptiness spoke eloquent to make certain what i knew before i began to restore these women to their dead selves through my awful work i laid in draculas tomb some of the wafer and so banished him from it undead for ever ,Dracula
then began my terrible task and i dreaded it had it been but one it had been easy comparative but three to begin twice more after i had been through a deed of horror for if it was terrible with the sweet miss lucy what would it not be with these strange ones who had survived through centuries and who had been strengthened by the passing of the years who would if they could have fought for their foul lives ,Dracula
oh my friend john but it was butcher work had i not been nerved by thoughts of other dead and of the living over whom hung such a pall of fear i could not have gone on i tremble and tremble even yet though till all was over god be thanked my nerve did stand had i not seen the repose in the first place and the gladness that stole over it just ere the final dissolution came as realisation that the soul had been won i could not have gone further with my butchery i could not have endured the horrid screeching as the stake drove home the plunging of writhing form and lips of bloody foam i should have fled in terror and left my work undone but it is over and the poor souls i can pity them now and weep as i think of them placid each in her full sleep of death for a short moment ere fading for friend john hardly had my knife severed the head of each before the whole body began to melt away and crumble in to its native dust as though the death that should have come centuries agone had at last assert himself and say at once and loud i am here ,Dracula
come she said come away from this awful place let us go to meet my husband who is i know coming towards us she was looking thin and pale and weak but her eyes were pure and glowed with fervour i was glad to see her paleness and her illness for my mind was full of the fresh horror of that ruddy vampire sleep ,Dracula
 novemberit was late in the afternoon when the professor and i took our way towards the east whence i knew jonathan was coming we did not go fast though the way was steeply downhill for we had to take heavy rugs and wraps with us we dared not face the possibility of being left without warmth in the cold and the snow we had to take some of our provisions too for we were in a perfect desolation and so far as we could see through the snowfall there was not even the sign of habitation when we had gone about a mile i was tired with the heavy walking and sat down to rest then we looked back and saw where the clear line of draculas castle cut the sky for we were so deep under the hill whereon it was set that the angle of perspective of the carpathian mountains was far below it we saw it in all its grandeur perched a thousand feet on the summit of a sheer precipice and with seemingly a great gap between it and the steep of the adjacent mountain on any side there was something wild and uncanny about the place we could hear the distant howling of wolves they were far off but the sound even though coming muffled through the deadening snowfall was full of terror i knew from the way dr van helsing was searching about that he was trying to seek some strategic point where we would be less exposed in case of attack the rough roadway still led downwards we could trace it through the drifted snow ,Dracula
in a little while the professor signalled to me so i got up and joined him he had found a wonderful spot a sort of natural hollow in a rock with an entrance like a doorway between two boulders he took me by the hand and drew me in see he said here you will be in shelter and if the wolves do come i can meet them one by one he brought in our furs and made a snug nest for me and got out some provisions and forced them upon me but i could not eat to even try to do so was repulsive to me and much as i would have liked to please him i could not bring myself to the attempt he looked very sad but did not reproach me taking his fieldglasses from the case he stood on the top of the rock and began to search the horizon suddenly he called out ,Dracula
look madam mina look look i sprang up and stood beside him on the rock he handed me his glasses and pointed the snow was now falling more heavily and swirled about fiercely for a high wind was beginning to blow however there were times when there were pauses between the snow flurries and i could see a long way round from the height where we were it was possible to see a great distance and far off beyond the white waste of snow i could see the river lying like a black ribbon in kinks and curls as it wound its way straight in front of us and not far offin fact so near that i wondered we had not noticed beforecame a group of mounted men hurrying along in the midst of them was a cart a long leiterwagon which swept from side to side like a dogs tail wagging with each stern inequality of the road outlined against the snow as they were i could see from the mens clothes that they were peasants or gypsies of some kind ,Dracula
on the cart was a great square chest my heart leaped as i saw it for i felt that the end was coming the evening was now drawing close and well i knew that at sunset the thing which was till then imprisoned there would take new freedom and could in any of many forms elude all pursuit in fear i turned to the professor to my consternation however he was not there an instant later i saw him below me round the rock he had drawn a circle such as we had found shelter in last night when he had completed it he stood beside me again saying ,Dracula
at least you shall be safe here from him he took the glasses from me and at the next lull of the snow swept the whole space below us see he said they come quickly they are flogging the horses and galloping as hard as they can he paused and went on in a hollow voice ,Dracula
they are racing for the sunset we may be too late gods will be done down came another blinding rush of driving snow and the whole landscape was blotted out it soon passed however and once more his glasses were fixed on the plain then came a sudden cry ,Dracula
look look look see two horsemen follow fast coming up from the south it must be quincey and john take the glass look before the snow blots it all out i took it and looked the two men might be dr seward and mr morris i knew at all events that neither of them was jonathan at the same time i knew that jonathan was not far off looking around i saw on the north side of the coming party two other men riding at breakneck speed one of them i knew was jonathan and the other i took of course to be lord godalming they too were pursuing the party with the cart when i told the professor he shouted in glee like a schoolboy and after looking intently till a snow fall made sight impossible he laid his winchester rifle ready for use against the boulder at the opening of our shelter they are all converging he said when the time comes we shall have gypsies on all sides i got out my revolver ready to hand for whilst we were speaking the howling of wolves came louder and closer when the snow storm abated a moment we looked again it was strange to see the snow falling in such heavy flakes close to us and beyond the sun shining more and more brightly as it sank down towards the far mountain tops sweeping the glass all around us i could see here and there dots moving singly and in twos and threes and larger numbersthe wolves were gathering for their prey ,Dracula
every instant seemed an age whilst we waited the wind came now in fierce bursts and the snow was driven with fury as it swept upon us in circling eddies at times we could not see an arms length before us but at others as the hollowsounding wind swept by us it seemed to clear the airspace around us so that we could see afar off we had of late been so accustomed to watch for sunrise and sunset that we knew with fair accuracy when it would be and we knew that before long the sun would set it was hard to believe that by our watches it was less than an hour that we waited in that rocky shelter before the various bodies began to converge close upon us the wind came now with fiercer and more bitter sweeps and more steadily from the north it seemingly had driven the snow clouds from us for with only occasional bursts the snow fell we could distinguish clearly the individuals of each party the pursued and the pursuers strangely enough those pursued did not seem to realise or at least to care that they were pursued they seemed however to hasten with redoubled speed as the sun dropped lower and lower on the mountain tops ,Dracula
closer and closer they drew the professor and i crouched down behind our rock and held our weapons ready i could see that he was determined that they should not pass one and all were quite unaware of our presence ,Dracula
all at once two voices shouted out to halt one was my jonathans raised in a high key of passion the other mr morris strong resolute tone of quiet command the gypsies may not have known the language but there was no mistaking the tone in whatever tongue the words were spoken instinctively they reined in and at the instant lord godalming and jonathan dashed up at one side and dr seward and mr morris on the other the leader of the gypsies a splendidlooking fellow who sat his horse like a centaur waved them back and in a fierce voice gave to his companions some word to proceed they lashed the horses which sprang forward but the four men raised their winchester rifles and in an unmistakable way commanded them to stop at the same moment dr van helsing and i rose behind the rock and pointed our weapons at them seeing that they were surrounded the men tightened their reins and drew up the leader turned to them and gave a word at which every man of the gypsy party drew what weapon he carried knife or pistol and held himself in readiness to attack issue was joined in an instant ,Dracula
the leader with a quick movement of his rein threw his horse out in front and pointing first to the sunnow close down on the hill topsand then to the castle said something which i did not understand for answer all four men of our party threw themselves from their horses and dashed towards the cart i should have felt terrible fear at seeing jonathan in such danger but that the ardour of battle must have been upon me as well as the rest of them i felt no fear but only a wild surging desire to do something seeing the quick movement of our parties the leader of the gypsies gave a command his men instantly formed round the cart in a sort of undisciplined endeavour each one shouldering and pushing the other in his eagerness to carry out the order ,Dracula
in the midst of this i could see that jonathan on one side of the ring of men and quincey on the other were forcing a way to the cart it was evident that they were bent on finishing their task before the sun should set nothing seemed to stop or even to hinder them neither the levelled weapons nor the flashing knives of the gypsies in front nor the howling of the wolves behind appeared to even attract their attention jonathans impetuosity and the manifest singleness of his purpose seemed to overawe those in front of him instinctively they cowered aside and let him pass in an instant he had jumped upon the cart and with a strength which seemed incredible raised the great box and flung it over the wheel to the ground in the meantime mr morris had had to use force to pass through his side of the ring of szgany all the time i had been breathlessly watching jonathan i had with the tail of my eye seen him pressing desperately forward and had seen the knives of the gypsies flash as he won a way through them and they cut at him he had parried with his great bowie knife and at first i thought that he too had come through in safety but as he sprang beside jonathan who had by now jumped from the cart i could see that with his left hand he was clutching at his side and that the blood was spurting through his fingers he did not delay notwithstanding this for as jonathan with desperate energy attacked one end of the chest attempting to prize off the lid with his great kukri knife he attacked the other frantically with his bowie under the efforts of both men the lid began to yield the nails drew with a quick screeching sound and the top of the box was thrown back ,Dracula
by this time the gypsies seeing themselves covered by the winchesters and at the mercy of lord godalming and dr seward had given in and made no resistance the sun was almost down on the mountain tops and the shadows of the whole group fell long upon the snow i saw the count lying within the box upon the earth some of which the rude falling from the cart had scattered over him he was deathly pale just like a waxen image and the red eyes glared with the horrible vindictive look which i knew too well ,Dracula
the gypsies taking us as in some way the cause of the extraordinary disappearance of the dead man turned without a word and rode away as if for their lives those who were unmounted jumped upon the leiterwagon and shouted to the horsemen not to desert them the wolves which had withdrawn to a safe distance followed in their wake leaving us alone ,Dracula
mr morris who had sunk to the ground leaned on his elbow holding his hand pressed to his side the blood still gushed through his fingers i flew to him for the holy circle did not now keep me back so did the two doctors jonathan knelt behind him and the wounded man laid back his head on his shoulder with a sigh he took with a feeble effort my hand in that of his own which was unstained he must have seen the anguish of my heart in my face for he smiled at me and said ,Dracula
the sun was now right down upon the mountain top and the red gleams fell upon my face so that it was bathed in rosy light with one impulse the men sank on their knees and a deep and earnest amen broke from all as their eyes followed the pointing of his finger the dying man spoke ,Dracula
seven years ago we all went through the flames and the happiness of some of us since then is we think well worth the pain we endured it is an added joy to mina and to me that our boys birthday is the same day as that on which quincey morris died his mother holds i know the secret belief that some of our brave friends spirit has passed into him his bundle of names links all our little band of men together but we call him quincey ,Dracula
in the summer of this year we made a journey to transylvania and went over the old ground which was and is to us so full of vivid and terrible memories it was almost impossible to believe that the things which we had seen with our own eyes and heard with our own ears were living truths every trace of all that had been was blotted out the castle stood as before reared high above a waste of desolation ,Dracula
when we got home we were talking of the old timewhich we could all look back on without despair for godalming and seward are both happily married i took the papers from the safe where they had been ever since our return so long ago we were struck with the fact that in all the mass of material of which the record is composed there is hardly one authentic document nothing but a mass of typewriting except the later notebooks of mina and seward and myself and van helsings memorandum we could hardly ask any one even did we wish to to accept these as proofs of so wild a story van helsing summed it all up as he said with our boy on his knee ,Dracula
we want no proofs we ask none to believe us this boy will some day know what a brave and gallant woman his mother is already he knows her sweetness and loving care later on he will understand how some men so loved her that they did dare much for her sake ,Dracula

you will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the commencement of an enterprise which you have regarded with such evil forebodings i arrived here yesterday and my first task is to assure my dear sister of my welfare and increasing confidence in the success of my undertaking ,Frankenstein
i am already far north of london and as i walk in the streets of petersburgh i feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks which braces my nerves and fills me with delight do you understand this feeling this breeze which has travelled from the regions towards which i am advancing gives me a foretaste of those icy climes inspirited by this wind of promise my daydreams become more fervent and vivid i try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of frost and desolation it ever presents itself to my imagination as the region of beauty and delight there margaret the sun is for ever visible its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a perpetual splendour therefor with your leave my sister i will put some trust in preceding navigatorsthere snow and frost are banished and sailing over a calm sea we may be wafted to a land surpassing in wonders and in beauty every region hitherto discovered on the habitable globe its productions and features may be without example as the phenomena of the heavenly bodies undoubtedly are in those undiscovered solitudes what may not be expected in a country of eternal light i may there discover the wondrous power which attracts the needle and may regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever i shall satiate my ardent curiosity with the sight of a part of the world never before visited and may tread a land never before imprinted by the foot of man these are my enticements and they are sufficient to conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little boat with his holiday mates on an expedition of discovery up his native river but supposing all these conjectures to be false you cannot contest the inestimable benefit which i shall confer on all mankind to the last generation by discovering a passage near the pole to those countries to reach which at present so many months are requisite or by ascertaining the secret of the magnet which if at all possible can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine ,Frankenstein
these reflections have dispelled the agitation with which i began my letter and i feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me to heaven for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as a steady purposea point on which the soul may fix its intellectual eye this expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years i have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have been made in the prospect of arriving at the north pacific ocean through the seas which surround the pole you may remember that a history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the whole of our good uncle thomas library my education was neglected yet i was passionately fond of reading these volumes were my study day and night and my familiarity with them increased that regret which i had felt as a child on learning that my fathers dying injunction had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life ,Frankenstein
these visions faded when i perused for the first time those poets whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven i also became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation i imagined that i also might obtain a niche in the temple where the names of homer and shakespeare are consecrated you are well acquainted with my failure and how heavily i bore the disappointment but just at that time i inherited the fortune of my cousin and my thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent ,Frankenstein
six years have passed since i resolved on my present undertaking i can even now remember the hour from which i dedicated myself to this great enterprise i commenced by inuring my body to hardship i accompanied the whalefishers on several expeditions to the north sea i voluntarily endured cold famine thirst and want of sleep i often worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my nights to the study of mathematics the theory of medicine and those branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive the greatest practical advantage twice i actually hired myself as an undermate in a greenland whaler and acquitted myself to admiration i must own i felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest earnestness so valuable did he consider my services ,Frankenstein
and now dear margaret do i not deserve to accomplish some great purpose my life might have been passed in ease and luxury but i preferred glory to every enticement that wealth placed in my path oh that some encouraging voice would answer in the affirmative my courage and my resolution is firm but my hopes fluctuate and my spirits are often depressed i am about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage the emergencies of which will demand all my fortitude i am required not only to raise the spirits of others but sometimes to sustain my own when theirs are failing ,Frankenstein
this is the most favourable period for travelling in russia they fly quickly over the snow in their sledges the motion is pleasant and in my opinion far more agreeable than that of an english stagecoach the cold is not excessive if you are wrapped in fursa dress which i have already adopted for there is a great difference between walking the deck and remaining seated motionless for hours when no exercise prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins i have no ambition to lose my life on the postroad between st petersburgh and archangel ,Frankenstein
i shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks and my intention is to hire a ship there which can easily be done by paying the insurance for the owner and to engage as many sailors as i think necessary among those who are accustomed to the whalefishing i do not intend to sail until the month of june and when shall i return ah dear sister how can i answer this question if i succeed many many months perhaps years will pass before you and i may meet if i fail you will see me again soon or never ,Frankenstein
how slowly the time passes here encompassed as i am by frost and snow yet a second step is taken towards my enterprise i have hired a vessel and am occupied in collecting my sailors those whom i have already engaged appear to be men on whom i can depend and are certainly possessed of dauntless courage ,Frankenstein
but i have one want which i have never yet been able to satisfy and the absence of the object of which i now feel as a most severe evil i have no friend margaret when i am glowing with the enthusiasm of success there will be none to participate my joy if i am assailed by disappointment no one will endeavour to sustain me in dejection i shall commit my thoughts to paper it is true but that is a poor medium for the communication of feeling i desire the company of a man who could sympathise with me whose eyes would reply to mine you may deem me romantic my dear sister but i bitterly feel the want of a friend i have no one near me gentle yet courageous possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind whose tastes are like my own to approve or amend my plans how would such a friend repair the faults of your poor brother i am too ardent in execution and too impatient of difficulties but it is a still greater evil to me that i am selfeducated for the first fourteen years of my life i ran wild on a common and read nothing but our uncle thomas books of voyages at that age i became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own country but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its most important benefits from such a conviction that i perceived the necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native country now i am twentyeight and am in reality more illiterate than many schoolboys of fifteen it is true that i have thought more and that my daydreams are more extended and magnificent but they want as the painters call it keeping and i greatly need a friend who would have sense enough not to despise me as romantic and affection enough for me to endeavour to regulate my mind ,Frankenstein
well these are useless complaints i shall certainly find no friend on the wide ocean nor even here in archangel among merchants and seamen yet some feelings unallied to the dross of human nature beat even in these rugged bosoms my lieutenant for instance is a man of wonderful courage and enterprise he is madly desirous of glory or rather to word my phrase more characteristically of advancement in his profession he is an englishman and in the midst of national and professional prejudices unsoftened by cultivation retains some of the noblest endowments of humanity i first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel finding that he was unemployed in this city i easily engaged him to assist in my enterprise ,Frankenstein
the master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline this circumstance added to his wellknown integrity and dauntless courage made me very desirous to engage him a youth passed in solitude my best years spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage has so refined the groundwork of my character that i cannot overcome an intense distaste to the usual brutality exercised on board ship i have never believed it to be necessary and when i heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew i felt myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services i heard of him first in rather a romantic manner from a lady who owes to him the happiness of her life this briefly is his story some years ago he loved a young russian lady of moderate fortune and having amassed a considerable sum in prizemoney the father of the girl consented to the match he saw his mistress once before the destined ceremony but she was bathed in tears and throwing herself at his feet entreated him to spare her confessing at the same time that she loved another but that he was poor and that her father would never consent to the union my generous friend reassured the suppliant and on being informed of the name of her lover instantly abandoned his pursuit he had already bought a farm with his money on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life but he bestowed the whole on his rival together with the remains of his prizemoney to purchase stock and then himself solicited the young womans father to consent to her marriage with her lover but the old man decidedly refused thinking himself bound in honour to my friend who when he found the father inexorable quitted his country nor returned until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her inclinations what a noble fellow you will exclaim he is so but then he is wholly uneducated he is as silent as a turk and a kind of ignorant carelessness attends him which while it renders his conduct the more astonishing detracts from the interest and sympathy which otherwise he would command ,Frankenstein
yet do not suppose because i complain a little or because i can conceive a consolation for my toils which i may never know that i am wavering in my resolutions those are as fixed as fate and my voyage is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation the winter has been dreadfully severe but the spring promises well and it is considered as a remarkably early season so that perhaps i may sail sooner than i expected i shall do nothing rashly you know me sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the safety of others is committed to my care ,Frankenstein
i cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my undertaking it is impossible to communicate to you a conception of the trembling sensation half pleasurable and half fearful with which i am preparing to depart i am going to unexplored regions to the land of mist and snow but i shall kill no albatross therefore do not be alarmed for my safety or if i should come back to you as worn and woeful as the ancient mariner you will smile at my allusion but i will disclose a secret i have often attributed my attachment to my passionate enthusiasm for the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that production of the most imaginative of modern poets there is something at work in my soul which i do not understand i am practically industriouspainstaking a workman to execute with perseverance and labourbut besides this there is a love for the marvellous a belief in the marvellous intertwined in all my projects which hurries me out of the common pathways of men even to the wild sea and unvisited regions i am about to explore ,Frankenstein
but to return to dearer considerations shall i meet you again after having traversed immense seas and returned by the most southern cape of africa or america i dare not expect such success yet i cannot bear to look on the reverse of the picture continue for the present to write to me by every opportunity i may receive your letters on some occasions when i need them most to support my spirits i love you very tenderly  remember me with affection should you never hear from me again ,Frankenstein
i write a few lines in haste to say that i am safeand well advanced on my voyage this letter will reach england by a merchantman now on its homeward voyage from archangel more fortunate than i who may not see my native land perhaps for many years i am however in good spirits my men are bold and apparently firm of purpose nor do the floating sheets of ice that continually pass us indicating the dangers of the region towards which we are advancing appear to dismay them we have already reached a very high latitude but it is the height of summer and although not so warm as in england the southern gales which blow us speedily towards those shores which i so ardently desire to attain breathe a degree of renovating warmth which i had not expected ,Frankenstein
no incidents have hitherto befallen us that would make a figure in a letter one or two stiff gales and the springing of a leak are accidents which experienced navigators scarcely remember to record and i shall be well content if nothing worse happen to us during our voyage ,Frankenstein
but success shall crown my endeavours wherefore not thus far i have gone tracing a secure way over the pathless seas the very stars themselves being witnesses and testimonies of my triumph why not still proceed over the untamed yet obedient element what can stop the determined heart and resolved will of man ,Frankenstein
last monday july st we were nearly surrounded by ice which closed in the ship on all sides scarcely leaving her the searoom in which she floated our situation was somewhat dangerous especially as we were compassed round by a very thick fog we accordingly lay to hoping that some change would take place in the atmosphere and weather ,Frankenstein
about two oclock the mist cleared away and we beheld stretched out in every direction vast and irregular plains of ice which seemed to have no end some of my comrades groaned and my own mind began to grow watchful with anxious thoughts when a strange sight suddenly attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own situation we perceived a low carriage fixed on a sledge and drawn by dogs pass on towards the north at the distance of half a mile a being which had the shape of a man but apparently of gigantic stature sat in the sledge and guided the dogs we watched the rapid progress of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the distant inequalities of the ice ,Frankenstein
this appearance excited our unqualified wonder we were as we believed many hundred miles from any land but this apparition seemed to denote that it was not in reality so distant as we had supposed shut in however by ice it was impossible to follow his track which we had observed with the greatest attention ,Frankenstein
about two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea and before night the ice broke and freed our ship we however lay to until the morning fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which float about after the breaking up of the ice i profited of this time to rest for a few hours ,Frankenstein
in the morning however as soon as it was light i went upon deck and found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel apparently talking to someone in the sea it was in fact a sledge like that we had seen before which had drifted towards us in the night on a large fragment of ice only one dog remained alive but there was a human being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel he was not as the other traveller seemed to be a savage inhabitant of some undiscovered island but a european when i appeared on deck the master said here is our captain and he will not allow you to perish on the open sea ,Frankenstein
you may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom i should have supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford i replied however that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the northern pole ,Frankenstein
upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board good god margaret if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for his safety your surprise would have been boundless his limbs were nearly frozen and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and suffering i never saw a man in so wretched a condition we attempted to carry him into the cabin but as soon as he had quitted the fresh air he fainted we accordingly brought him back to the deck and restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to swallow a small quantity as soon as he showed signs of life we wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the kitchen stove by slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup which restored him wonderfully ,Frankenstein
two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak and i often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding when he had in some measure recovered i removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit i never saw a more interesting creature his eyes have generally an expression of wildness and even madness but there are moments when if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service his whole countenance is lighted up as it were with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that i never saw equalled but he is generally melancholy and despairing and sometimes he gnashes his teeth as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him ,Frankenstein
when my guest was a little recovered i had great trouble to keep off the men who wished to ask him a thousand questions but i would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose once however the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle ,Frankenstein
this aroused the strangers attention and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dmon as he called him had pursued soon after when he was alone with me he said i have doubtless excited your curiosity as well as that of these good people but you are too considerate to make inquiries ,Frankenstein
soon after this he inquired if i thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge i replied that i could not answer with any degree of certainty for the ice had not broken until near midnight and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time but of this i could not judge ,Frankenstein
from this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger he manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared but i have persuaded him to remain in the cabin for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere i have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight ,Frankenstein
such is my journal of what relates to this strange occurrence up to the present day the stranger has gradually improved in health but is very silent and appears uneasy when anyone except myself enters his cabin yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all interested in him although they have had very little communication with him for my own part i begin to love him as a brother and his constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion he must have been a noble creature in his better days being even now in wreck so attractive and amiable ,Frankenstein
i said in one of my letters my dear margaret that i should find no friend on the wide ocean yet i have found a man who before his spirit had been broken by misery i should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart ,Frankenstein
my affection for my guest increases every day he excites at once my admiration and my pity to an astonishing degree how can i see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief he is so gentle yet so wise his mind is so cultivated and when he speaks although his words are culled with the choicest art yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence ,Frankenstein
he is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own yet although unhappy he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others he has frequently conversed with me on mine which i have communicated to him without disguise he entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures i had taken to secure it i was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say with all the fervour that warmed me how gladly i would sacrifice my fortune my existence my every hope to the furtherance of my enterprise one mans life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which i sought for the dominion i should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race as i spoke a dark gloom spread over my listeners countenance at first i perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion he placed his hands before his eyes and my voice quivered and failed me as i beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers a groan burst from his heaving breast i paused at length he spoke in broken accents unhappy man do you share my madness have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught hear me let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips ,Frankenstein
such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure ,Frankenstein
having conquered the violence of his feelings he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion and quelling the dark tyranny of despair he led me again to converse concerning myself personally he asked me the history of my earlier years the tale was quickly told but it awakened various trains of reflection i spoke of my desire of finding a friend of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing ,Frankenstein
i agree with you replied the stranger we are unfashioned creatures but half made up if one wiser better dearer than ourselvessuch a friend ought to bedo not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures i once had a friend the most noble of human creatures and am entitled therefore to judge respecting friendship you have hope and the world before you and have no cause for despair but ii have lost everything and cannot begin life anew ,Frankenstein
even broken in spirit as he is no one can feel more deeply than he does the beauties of nature the starry sky the sea and every sight afforded by these wonderful regions seem still to have the power of elevating his soul from earth such a man has a double existence he may suffer misery and be overwhelmed by disappointments yet when he has retired into himself he will be like a celestial spirit that has a halo around him within whose circle no grief or folly ventures ,Frankenstein
will you smile at the enthusiasm i express concerning this divine wanderer you would not if you saw him you have been tutored and refined by books and retirement from the world and you are therefore somewhat fastidious but this only renders you the more fit to appreciate the extraordinary merits of this wonderful man sometimes i have endeavoured to discover what quality it is which he possesses that elevates him so immeasurably above any other person i ever knew i believe it to be an intuitive discernment a quick but neverfailing power of judgment a penetration into the causes of things unequalled for clearness and precision add to this a facility of expression and a voice whose varied intonations are soulsubduing music ,Frankenstein
yesterday the stranger said to me you may easily perceive captain walton that i have suffered great and unparalleled misfortunes i had determined at one time that the memory of these evils should die with me but you have won me to alter my determination you seek for knowledge and wisdom as i once did and i ardently hope that the gratification of your wishes may not be a serpent to sting you as mine has been i do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you yet when i reflect that you are pursuing the same course exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what i am i imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure prepare to hear of occurrences which are usually deemed marvellous were we among the tamer scenes of nature i might fear to encounter your unbelief perhaps your ridicule but many things will appear possible in these wild and mysterious regions which would provoke the laughter of those unacquainted with the evervaried powers of nature nor can i doubt but that my tale conveys in its series internal evidence of the truth of the events of which it is composed ,Frankenstein
you may easily imagine that i was much gratified by the offered communication yet i could not endure that he should renew his grief by a recital of his misfortunes i felt the greatest eagerness to hear the promised narrative partly from curiosity and partly from a strong desire to ameliorate his fate if it were in my power i expressed these feelings in my answer ,Frankenstein
i thank you he replied for your sympathy but it is useless my fate is nearly fulfilled i wait but for one event and then i shall repose in peace i understand your feeling continued he perceiving that i wished to interrupt him but you are mistaken my friend if thus you will allow me to name you nothing can alter my destiny listen to my history and you will perceive how irrevocably it is determined ,Frankenstein
he then told me that he would commence his narrative the next day when i should be at leisure this promise drew from me the warmest thanks i have resolved every night when i am not imperatively occupied by my duties to record as nearly as possible in his own words what he has related during the day if i should be engaged i will at least make notes this manuscript will doubtless afford you the greatest pleasure but to me who know him and who hear it from his own lipswith what interest and sympathy shall i read it in some future day even now as i commence my task his fulltoned voice swells in my ears his lustrous eyes dwell on me with all their melancholy sweetness i see his thin hand raised in animation while the lineaments of his face are irradiated by the soul within strange and harrowing must be his story frightful the storm which embraced the gallant vessel on its course and wrecked itthus ,Frankenstein
i am by birth a genevese and my family is one of the most distinguished of that republic my ancestors had been for many years counsellors and syndics and my father had filled several public situations with honour and reputation he was respected by all who knew him for his integrity and indefatigable attention to public business he passed his younger days perpetually occupied by the affairs of his country a variety of circumstances had prevented his marrying early nor was it until the decline of life that he became a husband and the father of a family ,Frankenstein
as the circumstances of his marriage illustrate his character i cannot refrain from relating them one of his most intimate friends was a merchant who from a flourishing state fell through numerous mischances into poverty this man whose name was beaufort was of a proud and unbending disposition and could not bear to live in poverty and oblivion in the same country where he had formerly been distinguished for his rank and magnificence having paid his debts therefore in the most honourable manner he retreated with his daughter to the town of lucerne where he lived unknown and in wretchedness my father loved beaufort with the truest friendship and was deeply grieved by his retreat in these unfortunate circumstances he bitterly deplored the false pride which led his friend to a conduct so little worthy of the affection that united them he lost no time in endeavouring to seek him out with the hope of persuading him to begin the world again through his credit and assistance ,Frankenstein
beaufort had taken effectual measures to conceal himself and it was ten months before my father discovered his abode overjoyed at this discovery he hastened to the house which was situated in a mean street near the reuss but when he entered misery and despair alone welcomed him beaufort had saved but a very small sum of money from the wreck of his fortunes but it was sufficient to provide him with sustenance for some months and in the meantime he hoped to procure some respectable employment in a merchants house the interval was consequently spent in inaction his grief only became more deep and rankling when he had leisure for reflection and at length it took so fast hold of his mind that at the end of three months he lay on a bed of sickness incapable of any exertion ,Frankenstein
his daughter attended him with the greatest tenderness but she saw with despair that their little fund was rapidly decreasing and that there was no other prospect of support but caroline beaufort possessed a mind of an uncommon mould and her courage rose to support her in her adversity she procured plain work she plaited straw and by various means contrived to earn a pittance scarcely sufficient to support life ,Frankenstein
several months passed in this manner her father grew worse her time was more entirely occupied in attending him her means of subsistence decreased and in the tenth month her father died in her arms leaving her an orphan and a beggar this last blow overcame her and she knelt by beauforts coffin weeping bitterly when my father entered the chamber he came like a protecting spirit to the poor girl who committed herself to his care and after the interment of his friend he conducted her to geneva and placed her under the protection of a relation two years after this event caroline became his wife ,Frankenstein
there was a considerable difference between the ages of my parents but this circumstance seemed to unite them only closer in bonds of devoted affection there was a sense of justice in my fathers upright mind which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love strongly perhaps during former years he had suffered from the latediscovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set a greater value on tried worth there was a show of gratitude and worship in his attachment to my mother differing wholly from the doting fondness of age for it was inspired by reverence for her virtues and a desire to be the means of in some degree recompensing her for the sorrows she had endured but which gave inexpressible grace to his behaviour to her everything was made to yield to her wishes and her convenience he strove to shelter her as a fair exotic is sheltered by the gardener from every rougher wind and to surround her with all that could tend to excite pleasurable emotion in her soft and benevolent mind her health and even the tranquillity of her hitherto constant spirit had been shaken by what she had gone through during the two years that had elapsed previous to their marriage my father had gradually relinquished all his public functions and immediately after their union they sought the pleasant climate of italy and the change of scene and interest attendant on a tour through that land of wonders as a restorative for her weakened frame ,Frankenstein
from italy they visited germany and france i their eldest child was born at naples and as an infant accompanied them in their rambles i remained for several years their only child much as they were attached to each other they seemed to draw inexhaustible stores of affection from a very mine of love to bestow them upon me my mothers tender caresses and my fathers smile of benevolent pleasure while regarding me are my first recollections i was their plaything and their idol and something bettertheir child the innocent and helpless creature bestowed on them by heaven whom to bring up to good and whose future lot it was in their hands to direct to happiness or misery according as they fulfilled their duties towards me with this deep consciousness of what they owed towards the being to which they had given life added to the active spirit of tenderness that animated both it may be imagined that while during every hour of my infant life i received a lesson of patience of charity and of selfcontrol i was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but one train of enjoyment to me ,Frankenstein
for a long time i was their only care my mother had much desired to have a daughter but i continued their single offspring when i was about five years old while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of italy they passed a week on the shores of the lake of como their benevolent disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor this to my mother was more than a duty it was a necessity a passionremembering what she had suffered and how she had been relievedfor her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the afflicted during one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate while the number of halfclothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst shape one day when my father had gone by himself to milan my mother accompanied by me visited this abode she found a peasant and his wife hard working bent down by care and labour distributing a scanty meal to five hungry babes among these there was one which attracted my mother far above all the rest she appeared of a different stock the four others were darkeyed hardy little vagrants this child was thin and very fair her hair was the brightest living gold and despite the poverty of her clothing seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head her brow was clear and ample her blue eyes cloudless and her lips and the moulding of her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold her without looking on her as of a distinct species a being heavensent and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features ,Frankenstein
the peasant woman perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and admiration on this lovely girl eagerly communicated her history she was not her child but the daughter of a milanese nobleman her mother was a german and had died on giving her birth the infant had been placed with these good people to nurse they were better off then they had not been long married and their eldest child was but just born the father of their charge was one of those italians nursed in the memory of the antique glory of italyone among the schiavi ognor frementi who exerted himself to obtain the liberty of his country he became the victim of its weakness whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of austria was not known his property was confiscated his child became an orphan and a beggar she continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude abode fairer than a garden rose among darkleaved brambles ,Frankenstein
when my father returned from milan he found playing with me in the hall of our villa a child fairer than pictured cheruba creature who seemed to shed radiance from her looks and whose form and motions were lighter than the chamois of the hills the apparition was soon explained with his permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their charge to her they were fond of the sweet orphan her presence had seemed a blessing to them but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty and want when providence afforded her such powerful protection they consulted their village priest and the result was that elizabeth lavenza became the inmate of my parents housemy more than sisterthe beautiful and adored companion of all my occupations and my pleasures ,Frankenstein
everyone loved elizabeth the passionate and almost reverential attachment with which all regarded her became while i shared it my pride and my delight on the evening previous to her being brought to my home my mother had said playfully i have a pretty present for my victortomorrow he shall have it and when on the morrow she presented elizabeth to me as her promised gift i with childish seriousness interpreted her words literally and looked upon elizabeth as minemine to protect love and cherish all praises bestowed on her i received as made to a possession of my own we called each other familiarly by the name of cousin no word no expression could body forth the kind of relation in which she stood to memy more than sister since till death she was to be mine only ,Frankenstein
we were brought up together there was not quite a year difference in our ages i need not say that we were strangers to any species of disunion or dispute harmony was the soul of our companionship and the diversity and contrast that subsisted in our characters drew us nearer together elizabeth was of a calmer and more concentrated disposition but with all my ardour i was capable of a more intense application and was more deeply smitten with the thirst for knowledge she busied herself with following the aerial creations of the poets and in the majestic and wondrous scenes which surrounded our swiss home the sublime shapes of the mountains the changes of the seasons tempest and calm the silence of winter and the life and turbulence of our alpine summersshe found ample scope for admiration and delight while my companion contemplated with a serious and satisfied spirit the magnificent appearances of things i delighted in investigating their causes the world was to me a secret which i desired to divine curiosity earnest research to learn the hidden laws of nature gladness akin to rapture as they were unfolded to me are among the earliest sensations i can remember ,Frankenstein
on the birth of a second son my junior by seven years my parents gave up entirely their wandering life and fixed themselves in their native country we possessed a house in geneva and a campagne on belrive the eastern shore of the lake at the distance of rather more than a league from the city we resided principally in the latter and the lives of my parents were passed in considerable seclusion it was my temper to avoid a crowd and to attach myself fervently to a few i was indifferent therefore to my schoolfellows in general but i united myself in the bonds of the closest friendship to one among them henry clerval was the son of a merchant of geneva he was a boy of singular talent and fancy he loved enterprise hardship and even danger for its own sake he was deeply read in books of chivalry and romance he composed heroic songs and began to write many a tale of enchantment and knightly adventure he tried to make us act plays and to enter into masquerades in which the characters were drawn from the heroes of roncesvalles of the round table of king arthur and the chivalrous train who shed their blood to redeem the holy sepulchre from the hands of the infidels ,Frankenstein
no human being could have passed a happier childhood than myself my parents were possessed by the very spirit of kindness and indulgence we felt that they were not the tyrants to rule our lot according to their caprice but the agents and creators of all the many delights which we enjoyed when i mingled with other families i distinctly discerned how peculiarly fortunate my lot was and gratitude assisted the development of filial love ,Frankenstein
my temper was sometimes violent and my passions vehement but by some law in my temperature they were turned not towards childish pursuits but to an eager desire to learn and not to learn all things indiscriminately i confess that neither the structure of languages nor the code of governments nor the politics of various states possessed attractions for me it was the secrets of heaven and earth that i desired to learn and whether it was the outward substance of things or the inner spirit of nature and the mysterious soul of man that occupied me still my inquiries were directed to the metaphysical or in its highest sense the physical secrets of the world ,Frankenstein
meanwhile clerval occupied himself so to speak with the moral relations of things the busy stage of life the virtues of heroes and the actions of men were his theme and his hope and his dream was to become one among those whose names are recorded in story as the gallant and adventurous benefactors of our species the saintly soul of elizabeth shone like a shrinededicated lamp in our peaceful home her sympathy was ours her smile her soft voice the sweet glance of her celestial eyes were ever there to bless and animate us she was the living spirit of love to soften and attract i might have become sullen in my study rough through the ardour of my nature but that she was there to subdue me to a semblance of her own gentleness and clervalcould aught ill entrench on the noble spirit of clerval yet he might not have been so perfectly humane so thoughtful in his generosity so full of kindness and tenderness amidst his passion for adventurous exploit had she not unfolded to him the real loveliness of beneficence and made the doing good the end and aim of his soaring ambition ,Frankenstein
i feel exquisite pleasure in dwelling on the recollections of childhood before misfortune had tainted my mind and changed its bright visions of extensive usefulness into gloomy and narrow reflections upon self besides in drawing the picture of my early days i also record those events which led by insensible steps to my after tale of misery for when i would account to myself for the birth of that passion which afterwards ruled my destiny i find it arise like a mountain river from ignoble and almost forgotten sources but swelling as it proceeded it became the torrent which in its course has swept away all my hopes and joys ,Frankenstein
natural philosophy is the genius that has regulated my fate i desire therefore in this narration to state those facts which led to my predilection for that science when i was thirteen years of age we all went on a party of pleasure to the baths near thonon the inclemency of the weather obliged us to remain a day confined to the inn in this house i chanced to find a volume of the works of cornelius agrippa i opened it with apathy the theory which he attempts to demonstrate and the wonderful facts which he relates soon changed this feeling into enthusiasm a new light seemed to dawn upon my mind and bounding with joy i communicated my discovery to my father my father looked carelessly at the title page of my book and said ah cornelius agrippa my dear victor do not waste your time upon this it is sad trash ,Frankenstein
if instead of this remark my father had taken the pains to explain to me that the principles of agrippa had been entirely exploded and that a modern system of science had been introduced which possessed much greater powers than the ancient because the powers of the latter were chimerical while those of the former were real and practical under such circumstances i should certainly have thrown agrippa aside and have contented my imagination warmed as it was by returning with greater ardour to my former studies it is even possible that the train of my ideas would never have received the fatal impulse that led to my ruin but the cursory glance my father had taken of my volume by no means assured me that he was acquainted with its contents and i continued to read with the greatest avidity ,Frankenstein
when i returned home my first care was to procure the whole works of this author and afterwards of paracelsus and albertus magnus i read and studied the wild fancies of these writers with delight they appeared to me treasures known to few besides myself i have described myself as always having been imbued with a fervent longing to penetrate the secrets of nature in spite of the intense labour and wonderful discoveries of modern philosophers i always came from my studies discontented and unsatisfied sir isaac newton is said to have avowed that he felt like a child picking up shells beside the great and unexplored ocean of truth those of his successors in each branch of natural philosophy with whom i was acquainted appeared even to my boys apprehensions as tyros engaged in the same pursuit ,Frankenstein
the untaught peasant beheld the elements around him and was acquainted with their practical uses the most learned philosopher knew little more he had partially unveiled the face of nature but her immortal lineaments were still a wonder and a mystery he might dissect anatomise and give names but not to speak of a final cause causes in their secondary and tertiary grades were utterly unknown to him i had gazed upon the fortifications and impediments that seemed to keep human beings from entering the citadel of nature and rashly and ignorantly i had repined ,Frankenstein
but here were books and here were men who had penetrated deeper and knew more i took their word for all that they averred and i became their disciple it may appear strange that such should arise in the eighteenth century but while i followed the routine of education in the schools of geneva i was to a great degree selftaught with regard to my favourite studies my father was not scientific and i was left to struggle with a childs blindness added to a students thirst for knowledge under the guidance of my new preceptors i entered with the greatest diligence into the search of the philosophers stone and the elixir of life but the latter soon obtained my undivided attention wealth was an inferior object but what glory would attend the discovery if i could banish disease from the human frame and render man invulnerable to any but a violent death ,Frankenstein
nor were these my only visions the raising of ghosts or devils was a promise liberally accorded by my favourite authors the fulfilment of which i most eagerly sought and if my incantations were always unsuccessful i attributed the failure rather to my own inexperience and mistake than to a want of skill or fidelity in my instructors and thus for a time i was occupied by exploded systems mingling like an unadept a thousand contradictory theories and floundering desperately in a very slough of multifarious knowledge guided by an ardent imagination and childish reasoning till an accident again changed the current of my ideas ,Frankenstein
when i was about fifteen years old we had retired to our house near belrive when we witnessed a most violent and terrible thunderstorm it advanced from behind the mountains of jura and the thunder burst at once with frightful loudness from various quarters of the heavens i remained while the storm lasted watching its progress with curiosity and delight as i stood at the door on a sudden i beheld a stream of fire issue from an old and beautiful oak which stood about twenty yards from our house and so soon as the dazzling light vanished the oak had disappeared and nothing remained but a blasted stump when we visited it the next morning we found the tree shattered in a singular manner it was not splintered by the shock but entirely reduced to thin ribbons of wood i never beheld anything so utterly destroyed ,Frankenstein
before this i was not unacquainted with the more obvious laws of electricity on this occasion a man of great research in natural philosophy was with us and excited by this catastrophe he entered on the explanation of a theory which he had formed on the subject of electricity and galvanism which was at once new and astonishing to me all that he said threw greatly into the shade cornelius agrippa albertus magnus and paracelsus the lords of my imagination but by some fatality the overthrow of these men disinclined me to pursue my accustomed studies it seemed to me as if nothing would or could ever be known all that had so long engaged my attention suddenly grew despicable by one of those caprices of the mind which we are perhaps most subject to in early youth i at once gave up my former occupations set down natural history and all its progeny as a deformed and abortive creation and entertained the greatest disdain for a wouldbe science which could never even step within the threshold of real knowledge in this mood of mind i betook myself to the mathematics and the branches of study appertaining to that science as being built upon secure foundations and so worthy of my consideration ,Frankenstein
thus strangely are our souls constructed and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin when i look back it seems to me as if this almost miraculous change of inclination and will was the immediate suggestion of the guardian angel of my lifethe last effort made by the spirit of preservation to avert the storm that was even then hanging in the stars and ready to envelop me her victory was announced by an unusual tranquillity and gladness of soul which followed the relinquishing of my ancient and latterly tormenting studies it was thus that i was to be taught to associate evil with their prosecution happiness with their disregard ,Frankenstein
when i had attained the age of seventeen my parents resolved that i should become a student at the university of ingolstadt i had hitherto attended the schools of geneva but my father thought it necessary for the completion of my education that i should be made acquainted with other customs than those of my native country my departure was therefore fixed at an early date but before the day resolved upon could arrive the first misfortune of my life occurredan omen as it were of my future misery ,Frankenstein
elizabeth had caught the scarlet fever her illness was severe and she was in the greatest danger during her illness many arguments had been urged to persuade my mother to refrain from attending upon her she had at first yielded to our entreaties but when she heard that the life of her favourite was menaced she could no longer control her anxiety she attended her sickbed her watchful attentions triumphed over the malignity of the distemperelizabeth was saved but the consequences of this imprudence were fatal to her preserver on the third day my mother sickened her fever was accompanied by the most alarming symptoms and the looks of her medical attendants prognosticated the worst event on her deathbed the fortitude and benignity of this best of women did not desert her she joined the hands of elizabeth and myself my children she said my firmest hopes of future happiness were placed on the prospect of your union this expectation will now be the consolation of your father elizabeth my love you must supply my place to my younger children alas i regret that i am taken from you and happy and beloved as i have been is it not hard to quit you all but these are not thoughts befitting me i will endeavour to resign myself cheerfully to death and will indulge a hope of meeting you in another world ,Frankenstein
she died calmly and her countenance expressed affection even in death i need not describe the feelings of those whose dearest ties are rent by that most irreparable evil the void that presents itself to the soul and the despair that is exhibited on the countenance it is so long before the mind can persuade itself that she whom we saw every day and whose very existence appeared a part of our own can have departed for everthat the brightness of a beloved eye can have been extinguished and the sound of a voice so familiar and dear to the ear can be hushed never more to be heard these are the reflections of the first days but when the lapse of time proves the reality of the evil then the actual bitterness of grief commences yet from whom has not that rude hand rent away some dear connection and why should i describe a sorrow which all have felt and must feel the time at length arrives when grief is rather an indulgence than a necessity and the smile that plays upon the lips although it may be deemed a sacrilege is not banished my mother was dead but we had still duties which we ought to perform we must continue our course with the rest and learn to think ourselves fortunate whilst one remains whom the spoiler has not seized ,Frankenstein
my departure for ingolstadt which had been deferred by these events was now again determined upon i obtained from my father a respite of some weeks it appeared to me sacrilege so soon to leave the repose akin to death of the house of mourning and to rush into the thick of life i was new to sorrow but it did not the less alarm me i was unwilling to quit the sight of those that remained to me and above all i desired to see my sweet elizabeth in some degree consoled ,Frankenstein
she indeed veiled her grief and strove to act the comforter to us all she looked steadily on life and assumed its duties with courage and zeal she devoted herself to those whom she had been taught to call her uncle and cousins never was she so enchanting as at this time when she recalled the sunshine of her smiles and spent them upon us she forgot even her own regret in her endeavours to make us forget ,Frankenstein
the day of my departure at length arrived clerval spent the last evening with us he had endeavoured to persuade his father to permit him to accompany me and to become my fellow student but in vain his father was a narrowminded trader and saw idleness and ruin in the aspirations and ambition of his son henry deeply felt the misfortune of being debarred from a liberal education he said little but when he spoke i read in his kindling eye and in his animated glance a restrained but firm resolve not to be chained to the miserable details of commerce ,Frankenstein
we sat late we could not tear ourselves away from each other nor persuade ourselves to say the word farewell it was said and we retired under the pretence of seeking repose each fancying that the other was deceived but when at mornings dawn i descended to the carriage which was to convey me away they were all theremy father again to bless me clerval to press my hand once more my elizabeth to renew her entreaties that i would write often and to bestow the last feminine attentions on her playmate and friend ,Frankenstein
i threw myself into the chaise that was to convey me away and indulged in the most melancholy reflections i who had ever been surrounded by amiable companions continually engaged in endeavouring to bestow mutual pleasurei was now alone in the university whither i was going i must form my own friends and be my own protector my life had hitherto been remarkably secluded and domestic and this had given me invincible repugnance to new countenances i loved my brothers elizabeth and clerval these were old familiar faces but i believed myself totally unfitted for the company of strangers such were my reflections as i commenced my journey but as i proceeded my spirits and hopes rose i ardently desired the acquisition of knowledge i had often when at home thought it hard to remain during my youth cooped up in one place and had longed to enter the world and take my station among other human beings  now my desires were complied with and it would indeed have been folly to repent ,Frankenstein
i had sufficient leisure for these and many other reflections during my journey to ingolstadt which was long and fatiguing at length the high white steeple of the town met my eyes i alighted and was conducted to my solitary apartment to spend the evening as i pleased ,Frankenstein
the next morning i delivered my letters of introduction and paid a visit to some of the principal professors chanceor rather the evil influence the angel of destruction which asserted omnipotent sway over me from the moment i turned my reluctant steps from my fathers doorled me first to m krempe professor of natural philosophy he was an uncouth man but deeply imbued in the secrets of his science he asked me several questions concerning my progress in the different branches of science appertaining to natural philosophy i replied carelessly and partly in contempt mentioned the names of my alchemists as the principal authors i had studied the professor stared have you he said really spent your time in studying such nonsense ,Frankenstein
i replied in the affirmative every minute continued m krempe with warmth every instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly and entirely lost you have burdened your memory with exploded systems and useless names good god in what desert land have you lived where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they are ancient i little expected in this enlightened and scientific age to find a disciple of albertus magnus and paracelsus my dear sir you must begin your studies entirely anew ,Frankenstein
so saying he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure and dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural philosophy in its general relations and that m waldman a fellow professor would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he omitted ,Frankenstein
i returned home not disappointed for i have said that i had long considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated but i returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any shape m krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a repulsive countenance the teacher therefore did not prepossess me in favour of his pursuits in rather a too philosophical and connected a strain perhaps i have given an account of the conclusions i had come to concerning them in my early years as a child i had not been content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural science with a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters i had retrod the steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists besides i had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy it was very different when the masters of the science sought immortality and power such views although futile were grand but now the scene was changed the ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in science was chiefly founded i was required to exchange chimeras of boundless grandeur for realities of little worth ,Frankenstein
such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my residence at ingolstadt which were chiefly spent in becoming acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new abode but as the ensuing week commenced i thought of the information which m krempe had given me concerning the lectures and although i could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver sentences out of a pulpit i recollected what he had said of m waldman whom i had never seen as he had hitherto been out of town ,Frankenstein
partly from curiosity and partly from idleness i went into the lecturing room which m waldman entered shortly after this professor was very unlike his colleague he appeared about fifty years of age but with an aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence a few grey hairs covered his temples but those at the back of his head were nearly black his person was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest i had ever heard he began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and the various improvements made by different men of learning pronouncing with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers he then took a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of its elementary terms after having made a few preparatory experiments he concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry the terms of which i shall never forget ,Frankenstein
the ancient teachers of this science said he promised impossibilities and performed nothing the modern masters promise very little they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers whose hands seem only made to dabble in dirt and their eyes to pore over the microscope or crucible have indeed performed miracles they penetrate into the recesses of nature and show how she works in her hidingplaces they ascend into the heavens they have discovered how the blood circulates and the nature of the air we breathe they have acquired new and almost unlimited powers they can command the thunders of heaven mimic the earthquake and even mock the invisible world with its own shadows ,Frankenstein
such were the professors wordsrather let me say such the words of the fateenounced to destroy me as he went on i felt as if my soul were grappling with a palpable enemy one by one the various keys were touched which formed the mechanism of my being chord after chord was sounded and soon my mind was filled with one thought one conception one purpose so much has been done exclaimed the soul of frankensteinmore far more will i achieve treading in the steps already marked i will pioneer a new way explore unknown powers and unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation ,Frankenstein
i closed not my eyes that night my internal being was in a state of insurrection and turmoil i felt that order would thence arise but i had no power to produce it by degrees after the mornings dawn sleep came i awoke and my yesternights thoughts were as a dream there only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to devote myself to a science for which i believed myself to possess a natural talent on the same day i paid m waldman a visit his manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness i gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as i had given to his fellow professor he heard with attention the little narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of cornelius agrippa and paracelsus but without the contempt that m krempe had exhibited he said that these were men to whose indefatigable zeal modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their knowledge they had left to us as an easier task to give new names and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light the labours of men of genius however erroneously directed scarcely ever fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind i listened to his statement which was delivered without any presumption or affectation and then added that his lecture had removed my prejudices against modern chemists i expressed myself in measured terms with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his instructor without letting escape inexperience in life would have made me ashamed any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended labours i requested his advice concerning the books i ought to procure ,Frankenstein
i am happy said m waldman to have gained a disciple and if your application equals your ability i have no doubt of your success chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the greatest improvements have been and may be made it is on that account that i have made it my peculiar study but at the same time i have not neglected the other branches of science a man would make but a very sorry chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone if your wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty experimentalist i should advise you to apply to every branch of natural philosophy including mathematics ,Frankenstein
he then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines instructing me as to what i ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when i should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism he also gave me the list of books which i had requested and i took my leave ,Frankenstein
from this day natural philosophy and particularly chemistry in the most comprehensive sense of the term became nearly my sole occupation i read with ardour those works so full of genius and discrimination which modern inquirers have written on these subjects i attended the lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the university and i found even in m krempe a great deal of sound sense and real information combined it is true with a repulsive physiognomy and manners but not on that account the less valuable in m waldman i found a true friend his gentleness was never tinged by dogmatism and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and good nature that banished every idea of pedantry in a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension my application was at first fluctuating and uncertain it gained strength as i proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst i was yet engaged in my laboratory ,Frankenstein
as i applied so closely it may be easily conceived that my progress was rapid my ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students and my proficiency that of the masters professor krempe often asked me with a sly smile how cornelius agrippa went on whilst m waldman expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress two years passed in this manner during which i paid no visit to geneva but was engaged heart and soul in the pursuit of some discoveries which i hoped to make none but those who have experienced them can conceive of the enticements of science in other studies you go as far as others have gone before you and there is nothing more to know but in a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder a mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study and i who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this improved so rapidly that at the end of two years i made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university when i had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at ingolstadt my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements i thought of returning to my friends and my native town when an incident happened that protracted my stay ,Frankenstein
one of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was the structure of the human frame and indeed any animal endued with life whence i often asked myself did the principle of life proceed it was a bold question and one which has ever been considered as a mystery yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming acquainted if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our inquiries i revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of natural philosophy which relate to physiology unless i had been animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm my application to this study would have been irksome and almost intolerable to examine the causes of life we must first have recourse to death i became acquainted with the science of anatomy but this was not sufficient i must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body in my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors i do not ever remember to have trembled at a tale of superstition or to have feared the apparition of a spirit darkness had no effect upon my fancy and a churchyard was to me merely the receptacle of bodies deprived of life which from being the seat of beauty and strength had become food for the worm now i was led to examine the cause and progress of this decay and forced to spend days and nights in vaults and charnelhouses my attention was fixed upon every object the most insupportable to the delicacy of the human feelings i saw how the fine form of man was degraded and wasted i beheld the corruption of death succeed to the blooming cheek of life i saw how the worm inherited the wonders of the eye and brain i paused examining and analysing all the minutiae of causation as exemplified in the change from life to death and death to life until from the midst of this darkness a sudden light broke in upon mea light so brilliant and wondrous yet so simple that while i became dizzy with the immensity of the prospect which it illustrated i was surprised that among so many men of genius who had directed their inquiries towards the same science that i alone should be reserved to discover so astonishing a secret ,Frankenstein
remember i am not recording the vision of a madman the sun does not more certainly shine in the heavens than that which i now affirm is true some miracle might have produced it yet the stages of the discovery were distinct and probable after days and nights of incredible labour and fatigue i succeeded in discovering the cause of generation and life nay more i became myself capable of bestowing animation upon lifeless matter ,Frankenstein
the astonishment which i had at first experienced on this discovery soon gave place to delight and rapture after so much time spent in painful labour to arrive at once at the summit of my desires was the most gratifying consummation of my toils but this discovery was so great and overwhelming that all the steps by which i had been progressively led to it were obliterated and i beheld only the result what had been the study and desire of the wisest men since the creation of the world was now within my grasp not that like a magic scene it all opened upon me at once the information i had obtained was of a nature rather to direct my endeavours so soon as i should point them towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already accomplished i was like the arabian who had been buried with the dead and found a passage to life aided only by one glimmering and seemingly ineffectual light ,Frankenstein
i see by your eagerness and the wonder and hope which your eyes express my friend that you expect to be informed of the secret with which i am acquainted that cannot be listen patiently until the end of my story and you will easily perceive why i am reserved upon that subject i will not lead you on unguarded and ardent as i then was to your destruction and infallible misery learn from me if not by my precepts at least by my example how dangerous is the acquirement of knowledge and how much happier that man is who believes his native town to be the world than he who aspires to become greater than his nature will allow ,Frankenstein
when i found so astonishing a power placed within my hands i hesitated a long time concerning the manner in which i should employ it although i possessed the capacity of bestowing animation yet to prepare a frame for the reception of it with all its intricacies of fibres muscles and veins still remained a work of inconceivable difficulty and labour i doubted at first whether i should attempt the creation of a being like myself or one of simpler organization but my imagination was too much exalted by my first success to permit me to doubt of my ability to give life to an animal as complex and wonderful as man the materials at present within my command hardly appeared adequate to so arduous an undertaking but i doubted not that i should ultimately succeed i prepared myself for a multitude of reverses my operations might be incessantly baffled and at last my work be imperfect yet when i considered the improvement which every day takes place in science and mechanics i was encouraged to hope my present attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success nor could i consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any argument of its impracticability it was with these feelings that i began the creation of a human being as the minuteness of the parts formed a great hindrance to my speed i resolved contrary to my first intention to make the being of a gigantic stature that is to say about eight feet in height and proportionably large after having formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully collecting and arranging my materials i began ,Frankenstein
no one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards like a hurricane in the first enthusiasm of success life and death appeared to me ideal bounds which i should first break through and pour a torrent of light into our dark world a new species would bless me as its creator and source many happy and excellent natures would owe their being to me no father could claim the gratitude of his child so completely as i should deserve theirs pursuing these reflections i thought that if i could bestow animation upon lifeless matter i might in process of time although i now found it impossible renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption ,Frankenstein
these thoughts supported my spirits while i pursued my undertaking with unremitting ardour my cheek had grown pale with study and my person had become emaciated with confinement sometimes on the very brink of certainty i failed yet still i clung to the hope which the next day or the next hour might realise one secret which i alone possessed was the hope to which i had dedicated myself and the moon gazed on my midnight labours while with unrelaxed and breathless eagerness i pursued nature to her hidingplaces who shall conceive the horrors of my secret toil as i dabbled among the unhallowed damps of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless clay my limbs now tremble and my eyes swim with the remembrance but then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward i seemed to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit it was indeed but a passing trance that only made me feel with renewed acuteness so soon as the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate i had returned to my old habits i collected bones from charnelhouses and disturbed with profane fingers the tremendous secrets of the human frame in a solitary chamber or rather cell at the top of the house and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase i kept my workshop of filthy creation my eyeballs were starting from their sockets in attending to the details of my employment the dissecting room and the slaughterhouse furnished many of my materials and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation whilst still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased i brought my work near to a conclusion ,Frankenstein
the summer months passed while i was thus engaged heart and soul in one pursuit it was a most beautiful season never did the fields bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant vintage but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature and the same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also to forget those friends who were so many miles absent and whom i had not seen for so long a time i knew my silence disquieted them and i well remembered the words of my father i know that while you are pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection and we shall hear regularly from you you must pardon me if i regard any interruption in your correspondence as a proof that your other duties are equally neglected ,Frankenstein
i knew well therefore what would be my fathers feelings but i could not tear my thoughts from my employment loathsome in itself but which had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination i wished as it were to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection until the great object which swallowed up every habit of my nature should be completed ,Frankenstein
i then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect to vice or faultiness on my part but i am now convinced that he was justified in conceiving that i should not be altogether free from blame a human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to disturb his tranquillity i do not think that the pursuit of knowledge is an exception to this rule if the study to which you apply yourself has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix then that study is certainly unlawful that is to say not befitting the human mind if this rule were always observed if no man allowed any pursuit whatsoever to interfere with the tranquillity of his domestic affections greece had not been enslaved csar would have spared his country america would have been discovered more gradually and the empires of mexico and peru had not been destroyed ,Frankenstein
my father made no reproach in his letters and only took notice of my silence by inquiring into my occupations more particularly than before winter spring and summer passed away during my labours but i did not watch the blossom or the expanding leavessights which before always yielded me supreme delightso deeply was i engrossed in my occupation the leaves of that year had withered before my work drew near to a close and now every day showed me more plainly how well i had succeeded but my enthusiasm was checked by my anxiety and i appeared rather like one doomed by slavery to toil in the mines or any other unwholesome trade than an artist occupied by his favourite employment every night i was oppressed by a slow fever and i became nervous to a most painful degree the fall of a leaf startled me and i shunned my fellow creatures as if i had been guilty of a crime sometimes i grew alarmed at the wreck i perceived that i had become the energy of my purpose alone sustained me my labours would soon end and i believed that exercise and amusement would then drive away incipient disease and i promised myself both of these when my creation should be complete ,Frankenstein
it was on a dreary night of november that i beheld the accomplishment of my toils with an anxiety that almost amounted to agony i collected the instruments of life around me that i might infuse a spark of being into the lifeless thing that lay at my feet it was already one in the morning the rain pattered dismally against the panes and my candle was nearly burnt out when by the glimmer of the halfextinguished light i saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open it breathed hard and a convulsive motion agitated its limbs ,Frankenstein
how can i describe my emotions at this catastrophe or how delineate the wretch whom with such infinite pains and care i had endeavoured to form his limbs were in proportion and i had selected his features as beautiful beautiful great god his yellow skin scarcely covered the work of muscles and arteries beneath his hair was of a lustrous black and flowing his teeth of a pearly whiteness but these luxuriances only formed a more horrid contrast with his watery eyes that seemed almost of the same colour as the dunwhite sockets in which they were set his shrivelled complexion and straight black lips ,Frankenstein
the different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings of human nature i had worked hard for nearly two years for the sole purpose of infusing life into an inanimate body for this i had deprived myself of rest and health i had desired it with an ardour that far exceeded moderation but now that i had finished the beauty of the dream vanished and breathless horror and disgust filled my heart unable to endure the aspect of the being i had created i rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my bedchamber unable to compose my mind to sleep at length lassitude succeeded to the tumult i had before endured and i threw myself on the bed in my clothes endeavouring to seek a few moments of forgetfulness but it was in vain i slept indeed but i was disturbed by the wildest dreams i thought i saw elizabeth in the bloom of health walking in the streets of ingolstadt delighted and surprised i embraced her but as i imprinted the first kiss on her lips they became livid with the hue of death her features appeared to change and i thought that i held the corpse of my dead mother in my arms a shroud enveloped her form and i saw the graveworms crawling in the folds of the flannel i started from my sleep with horror a cold dew covered my forehead my teeth chattered and every limb became convulsed when by the dim and yellow light of the moon as it forced its way through the window shutters i beheld the wretchthe miserable monster whom i had created he held up the curtain of the bed and his eyes if eyes they may be called were fixed on me his jaws opened and he muttered some inarticulate sounds while a grin wrinkled his cheeks he might have spoken but i did not hear one hand was stretched out seemingly to detain me but i escaped and rushed downstairs i took refuge in the courtyard belonging to the house which i inhabited where i remained during the rest of the night walking up and down in the greatest agitation listening attentively catching and fearing each sound as if it were to announce the approach of the demoniacal corpse to which i had so miserably given life ,Frankenstein
oh no mortal could support the horror of that countenance a mummy again endued with animation could not be so hideous as that wretch i had gazed on him while unfinished he was ugly then but when those muscles and joints were rendered capable of motion it became a thing such as even dante could not have conceived ,Frankenstein
i passed the night wretchedly sometimes my pulse beat so quickly and hardly that i felt the palpitation of every artery at others i nearly sank to the ground through languor and extreme weakness mingled with this horror i felt the bitterness of disappointment dreams that had been my food and pleasant rest for so long a space were now become a hell to me and the change was so rapid the overthrow so complete ,Frankenstein
morning dismal and wet at length dawned and discovered to my sleepless and aching eyes the church of ingolstadt its white steeple and clock which indicated the sixth hour the porter opened the gates of the court which had that night been my asylum and i issued into the streets pacing them with quick steps as if i sought to avoid the wretch whom i feared every turning of the street would present to my view i did not dare return to the apartment which i inhabited but felt impelled to hurry on although drenched by the rain which poured from a black and comfortless sky ,Frankenstein
i continued walking in this manner for some time endeavouring by bodily exercise to ease the load that weighed upon my mind i traversed the streets without any clear conception of where i was or what i was doing my heart palpitated in the sickness of fear and i hurried on with irregular steps not daring to look about me like one who on a lonely road doth walk in fear and dread and having once turned round walks on and turns no more his head because he knows a frightful fiend doth close behind him tread coleridges ancient mariner ,Frankenstein
continuing thus i came at length opposite to the inn at which the various diligences and carriages usually stopped here i paused i knew not why but i remained some minutes with my eyes fixed on a coach that was coming towards me from the other end of the street as it drew nearer i observed that it was the swiss diligence it stopped just where i was standing and on the door being opened i perceived henry clerval who on seeing me instantly sprung out my dear frankenstein exclaimed he how glad i am to see you how fortunate that you should be here at the very moment of my alighting ,Frankenstein
nothing could equal my delight on seeing clerval his presence brought back to my thoughts my father elizabeth and all those scenes of home so dear to my recollection i grasped his hand and in a moment forgot my horror and misfortune i felt suddenly and for the first time during many months calm and serene joy i welcomed my friend therefore in the most cordial manner and we walked towards my college clerval continued talking for some time about our mutual friends and his own good fortune in being permitted to come to ingolstadt you may easily believe said he how great was the difficulty to persuade my father that all necessary knowledge was not comprised in the noble art of bookkeeping and indeed i believe i left him incredulous to the last for his constant answer to my unwearied entreaties was the same as that of the dutch schoolmaster in the vicar of wakefield i have ten thousand florins a year without greek i eat heartily without greek but his affection for me at length overcame his dislike of learning and he has permitted me to undertake a voyage of discovery to the land of knowledge ,Frankenstein
very well and very happy only a little uneasy that they hear from you so seldom by the by i mean to lecture you a little upon their account myself but my dear frankenstein continued he stopping short and gazing full in my face i did not before remark how very ill you appear so thin and pale you look as if you had been watching for several nights ,Frankenstein
you have guessed right i have lately been so deeply engaged in one occupation that i have not allowed myself sufficient rest as you see but i hope i sincerely hope that all these employments are now at an end and that i am at length free ,Frankenstein
i trembled excessively i could not endure to think of and far less to allude to the occurrences of the preceding night i walked with a quick pace and we soon arrived at my college i then reflected and the thought made me shiver that the creature whom i had left in my apartment might still be there alive and walking about i dreaded to behold this monster but i feared still more that henry should see him entreating him therefore to remain a few minutes at the bottom of the stairs i darted up towards my own room my hand was already on the lock of the door before i recollected myself i then paused and a cold shivering came over me i threw the door forcibly open as children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in waiting for them on the other side but nothing appeared i stepped fearfully in the apartment was empty and my bedroom was also freed from its hideous guest i could hardly believe that so great a good fortune could have befallen me but when i became assured that my enemy had indeed fled i clapped my hands for joy and ran down to clerval ,Frankenstein
we ascended into my room and the servant presently brought breakfast but i was unable to contain myself it was not joy only that possessed me i felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness and my pulse beat rapidly i was unable to remain for a single instant in the same place i jumped over the chairs clapped my hands and laughed aloud clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival but when he observed me more attentively he saw a wildness in my eyes for which he could not account and my loud unrestrained heartless laughter frightened and astonished him ,Frankenstein
do not ask me cried i putting my hands before my eyes for i thought i saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room he can tell oh save me save me i imagined that the monster seized me i struggled furiously and fell down in a fit ,Frankenstein
poor clerval what must have been his feelings a meeting which he anticipated with such joy so strangely turned to bitterness but i was not the witness of his grief for i was lifeless and did not recover my senses for a long long time ,Frankenstein
this was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for several months during all that time henry was my only nurse i afterwards learned that knowing my fathers advanced age and unfitness for so long a journey and how wretched my sickness would make elizabeth he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my disorder he knew that i could not have a more kind and attentive nurse than himself and firm in the hope he felt of my recovery he did not doubt that instead of doing harm he performed the kindest action that he could towards them ,Frankenstein
but i was in reality very ill and surely nothing but the unbounded and unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life the form of the monster on whom i had bestowed existence was for ever before my eyes and i raved incessantly concerning him doubtless my words surprised henry he at first believed them to be the wanderings of my disturbed imagination but the pertinacity with which i continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event ,Frankenstein
by very slow degrees and with frequent relapses that alarmed and grieved my friend i recovered i remember the first time i became capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure i perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window it was a divine spring and the season contributed greatly to my convalescence i felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in my bosom my gloom disappeared and in a short time i became as cheerful as before i was attacked by the fatal passion ,Frankenstein
dearest clerval exclaimed i how kind how very good you are to me this whole winter instead of being spent in study as you promised yourself has been consumed in my sick room how shall i ever repay you i feel the greatest remorse for the disappointment of which i have been the occasion but you will forgive me ,Frankenstein
compose yourself said clerval who observed my change of colour i will not mention it if it agitates you but your father and cousin would be very happy if they received a letter from you in your own handwriting they hardly know how ill you have been and are uneasy at your long silence ,Frankenstein
you have been ill very ill and even the constant letters of dear kind henry are not sufficient to reassure me on your account you are forbidden to writeto hold a pen yet one word from you dear victor is necessary to calm our apprehensions for a long time i have thought that each post would bring this line and my persuasions have restrained my uncle from undertaking a journey to ingolstadt i have prevented his encountering the inconveniences and perhaps dangers of so long a journey yet how often have i regretted not being able to perform it myself i figure to myself that the task of attending on your sickbed has devolved on some mercenary old nurse who could never guess your wishes nor minister to them with the care and affection of your poor cousin yet that is over now clerval writes that indeed you are getting better i eagerly hope that you will confirm this intelligence soon in your own handwriting ,Frankenstein
get welland return to us you will find a happy cheerful home and friends who love you dearly your fathers health is vigorous and he asks but to see you but to be assured that you are well and not a care will ever cloud his benevolent countenance how pleased you would be to remark the improvement of our ernest he is now sixteen and full of activity and spirit he is desirous to be a true swiss and to enter into foreign service but we cannot part with him at least until his elder brother returns to us my uncle is not pleased with the idea of a military career in a distant country but ernest never had your powers of application he looks upon study as an odious fetter his time is spent in the open air climbing the hills or rowing on the lake i fear that he will become an idler unless we yield the point and permit him to enter on the profession which he has selected ,Frankenstein
little alteration except the growth of our dear children has taken place since you left us the blue lake and snowclad mountainsthey never change and i think our placid home and our contented hearts are regulated by the same immutable laws my trifling occupations take up my time and amuse me and i am rewarded for any exertions by seeing none but happy kind faces around me since you left us but one change has taken place in our little household do you remember on what occasion justine moritz entered our family probably you do not i will relate her history therefore in a few words madame moritz her mother was a widow with four children of whom justine was the third this girl had always been the favourite of her father but through a strange perversity her mother could not endure her and after the death of m moritz treated her very ill my aunt observed this and when justine was twelve years of age prevailed on her mother to allow her to live at our house the republican institutions of our country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which prevail in the great monarchies that surround it hence there is less distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants and the lower orders being neither so poor nor so despised their manners are more refined and moral a servant in geneva does not mean the same thing as a servant in france and england justine thus received in our family learned the duties of a servant a condition which in our fortunate country does not include the idea of ignorance and a sacrifice of the dignity of a human being ,Frankenstein
justine you may remember was a great favourite of yours and i recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour one glance from justine could dissipate it for the same reason that ariosto gives concerning the beauty of angelicashe looked so frankhearted and happy my aunt conceived a great attachment for her by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that which she had at first intended this benefit was fully repaid justine was the most grateful little creature in the world i do not mean that she made any professions i never heard one pass her lips but you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt she thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her phraseology and manners so that even now she often reminds me of her ,Frankenstein
when my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own grief to notice poor justine who had attended her during her illness with the most anxious affection poor justine was very ill but other trials were reserved for her ,Frankenstein
one by one her brothers and sister died and her mother with the exception of her neglected daughter was left childless the conscience of the woman was troubled she began to think that the deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her partiality she was a roman catholic and i believe her confessor confirmed the idea which she had conceived accordingly a few months after your departure for ingolstadt justine was called home by her repentant mother poor girl she wept when she quitted our house she was much altered since the death of my aunt grief had given softness and a winning mildness to her manners which had before been remarkable for vivacity nor was her residence at her mothers house of a nature to restore her gaiety the poor woman was very vacillating in her repentance she sometimes begged justine to forgive her unkindness but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her brothers and sister perpetual fretting at length threw madame moritz into a decline which at first increased her irritability but she is now at peace for ever she died on the first approach of cold weather at the beginning of this last winter justine has just returned to us and i assure you i love her tenderly she is very clever and gentle and extremely pretty as i mentioned before her mien and her expression continually remind me of my dear aunt ,Frankenstein
i must say also a few words to you my dear cousin of little darling william i wish you could see him he is very tall of his age with sweet laughing blue eyes dark eyelashes and curling hair when he smiles two little dimples appear on each cheek which are rosy with health he has already had one or two little wives but louisa biron is his favourite a pretty little girl of five years of age ,Frankenstein
now dear victor i dare say you wish to be indulged in a little gossip concerning the good people of geneva the pretty miss mansfield has already received the congratulatory visits on her approaching marriage with a young englishman john melbourne esq her ugly sister manon married m duvillard the rich banker last autumn your favourite schoolfellow louis manoir has suffered several misfortunes since the departure of clerval from geneva but he has already recovered his spirits and is reported to be on the point of marrying a lively pretty frenchwoman madame tavernier she is a widow and much older than manoir but she is very much admired and a favourite with everybody ,Frankenstein
i have written myself into better spirits dear cousin but my anxiety returns upon me as i conclude write dearest victorone lineone word will be a blessing to us ten thousand thanks to henry for his kindness his affection and his many letters we are sincerely grateful adieu my cousin take care of yourself and i entreat you write ,Frankenstein
dear dear elizabeth i exclaimed when i had read her letter i will write instantly and relieve them from the anxiety they must feel i wrote and this exertion greatly fatigued me but my convalescence had commenced and proceeded regularly in another fortnight i was able to leave my chamber ,Frankenstein
one of my first duties on my recovery was to introduce clerval to the several professors of the university in doing this i underwent a kind of rough usage ill befitting the wounds that my mind had sustained ever since the fatal night the end of my labours and the beginning of my misfortunes i had conceived a violent antipathy even to the name of natural philosophy when i was otherwise quite restored to health the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony of my nervous symptoms henry saw this and had removed all my apparatus from my view he had also changed my apartment for he perceived that i had acquired a dislike for the room which had previously been my laboratory but these cares of clerval were made of no avail when i visited the professors m waldman inflicted torture when he praised with kindness and warmth the astonishing progress i had made in the sciences he soon perceived that i disliked the subject but not guessing the real cause he attributed my feelings to modesty and changed the subject from my improvement to the science itself with a desire as i evidently saw of drawing me out what could i do he meant to please and he tormented me i felt as if he had placed carefully one by one in my view those instruments which were to be afterwards used in putting me to a slow and cruel death i writhed under his words yet dared not exhibit the pain i felt clerval whose eyes and feelings were always quick in discerning the sensations of others declined the subject alleging in excuse his total ignorance and the conversation took a more general turn i thanked my friend from my heart but i did not speak i saw plainly that he was surprised but he never attempted to draw my secret from me and although i loved him with a mixture of affection and reverence that knew no bounds yet i could never persuade myself to confide in him that event which was so often present to my recollection but which i feared the detail to another would only impress more deeply ,Frankenstein
m krempe was not equally docile and in my condition at that time of almost insupportable sensitiveness his harsh blunt encomiums gave me even more pain than the benevolent approbation of m waldman dn the fellow cried he why m clerval i assure you he has outstript us all ay stare if you please but it is nevertheless true a youngster who but a few years ago believed in cornelius agrippa as firmly as in the gospel has now set himself at the head of the university and if he is not soon pulled down we shall all be out of countenanceay ay continued he observing my face expressive of suffering m frankenstein is modest an excellent quality in a young man young men should be diffident of themselves you know m clerval i was myself when young but that wears out in a very short time ,Frankenstein
clerval had never sympathised in my tastes for natural science and his literary pursuits differed wholly from those which had occupied me he came to the university with the design of making himself complete master of the oriental languages and thus he should open a field for the plan of life he had marked out for himself resolved to pursue no inglorious career he turned his eyes toward the east as affording scope for his spirit of enterprise the persian arabic and sanskrit languages engaged his attention and i was easily induced to enter on the same studies idleness had ever been irksome to me and now that i wished to fly from reflection and hated my former studies i felt great relief in being the fellowpupil with my friend and found not only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists i did not like him attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects for i did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary amusement i read merely to understand their meaning and they well repaid my labours their melancholy is soothing and their joy elevating to a degree i never experienced in studying the authors of any other country when you read their writings life appears to consist in a warm sun and a garden of rosesin the smiles and frowns of a fair enemy and the fire that consumes your own heart how different from the manly and heroical poetry of greece and rome ,Frankenstein
summer passed away in these occupations and my return to geneva was fixed for the latter end of autumn but being delayed by several accidents winter and snow arrived the roads were deemed impassable and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring i felt this delay very bitterly for i longed to see my native town and my beloved friends my return had only been delayed so long from an unwillingness to leave clerval in a strange place before he had become acquainted with any of its inhabitants the winter however was spent cheerfully and although the spring was uncommonly late when it came its beauty compensated for its dilatoriness ,Frankenstein
the month of may had already commenced and i expected the letter daily which was to fix the date of my departure when henry proposed a pedestrian tour in the environs of ingolstadt that i might bid a personal farewell to the country i had so long inhabited i acceded with pleasure to this proposition i was fond of exercise and clerval had always been my favourite companion in the ramble of this nature that i had taken among the scenes of my native country ,Frankenstein
we passed a fortnight in these perambulations my health and spirits had long been restored and they gained additional strength from the salubrious air i breathed the natural incidents of our progress and the conversation of my friend study had before secluded me from the intercourse of my fellowcreatures and rendered me unsocial but clerval called forth the better feelings of my heart he again taught me to love the aspect of nature and the cheerful faces of children excellent friend how sincerely you did love me and endeavour to elevate my mind until it was on a level with your own a selfish pursuit had cramped and narrowed me until your gentleness and affection warmed and opened my senses i became the same happy creature who a few years ago loved and beloved by all had no sorrow or care when happy inanimate nature had the power of bestowing on me the most delightful sensations a serene sky and verdant fields filled me with ecstasy the present season was indeed divine the flowers of spring bloomed in the hedges while those of summer were already in bud i was undisturbed by thoughts which during the preceding year had pressed upon me notwithstanding my endeavours to throw them off with an invincible burden ,Frankenstein
henry rejoiced in my gaiety and sincerely sympathised in my feelings he exerted himself to amuse me while he expressed the sensations that filled his soul the resources of his mind on this occasion were truly astonishing his conversation was full of imagination and very often in imitation of the persian and arabic writers he invented tales of wonderful fancy and passion at other times he repeated my favourite poems or drew me out into arguments which he supported with great ingenuity ,Frankenstein
you have probably waited impatiently for a letter to fix the date of your return to us and i was at first tempted to write only a few lines merely mentioning the day on which i should expect you but that would be a cruel kindness and i dare not do it what would be your surprise my son when you expected a happy and glad welcome to behold on the contrary tears and wretchedness and how victor can i relate our misfortune absence cannot have rendered you callous to our joys and griefs and how shall i inflict pain on my long absent son i wish to prepare you for the woeful news but i know it is impossible even now your eye skims over the page to seek the words which are to convey to you the horrible tidings ,Frankenstein
last thursday may th i my niece and your two brothers went to walk in plainpalais the evening was warm and serene and we prolonged our walk farther than usual it was already dusk before we thought of returning and then we discovered that william and ernest who had gone on before were not to be found we accordingly rested on a seat until they should return presently ernest came and enquired if we had seen his brother he said that he had been playing with him that william had run away to hide himself and that he vainly sought for him and afterwards waited for a long time but that he did not return ,Frankenstein
this account rather alarmed us and we continued to search for him until night fell when elizabeth conjectured that he might have returned to the house he was not there we returned again with torches for i could not rest when i thought that my sweet boy had lost himself and was exposed to all the damps and dews of night elizabeth also suffered extreme anguish about five in the morning i discovered my lovely boy whom the night before i had seen blooming and active in health stretched on the grass livid and motionless the print of the murders finger was on his neck ,Frankenstein
he was conveyed home and the anguish that was visible in my countenance betrayed the secret to elizabeth she was very earnest to see the corpse at first i attempted to prevent her but she persisted and entering the room where it lay hastily examined the neck of the victim and clasping her hands exclaimed o god i have murdered my darling child ,Frankenstein
she fainted and was restored with extreme difficulty when she again lived it was only to weep and sigh she told me that that same evening william had teased her to let him wear a very valuable miniature that she possessed of your mother this picture is gone and was doubtless the temptation which urged the murderer to the deed we have no trace of him at present although our exertions to discover him are unremitted but they will not restore my beloved william ,Frankenstein
come dearest victor you alone can console elizabeth she weeps continually and accuses herself unjustly as the cause of his death her words pierce my heart we are all unhappy but will not that be an additional motive for you my son to return and be our comforter your dear mother alas victor i now say thank god she did not live to witness the cruel miserable death of her youngest darling ,Frankenstein
come victor not brooding thoughts of vengeance against the assassin but with feelings of peace and gentleness that will heal instead of festering the wounds of our minds enter the house of mourning my friend but with kindness and affection for those who love you and not with hatred for your enemies ,Frankenstein
clerval who had watched my countenance as i read this letter was surprised to observe the despair that succeeded the joy i at first expressed on receiving new from my friends i threw the letter on the table and covered my face with my hands ,Frankenstein
during our walk clerval endeavoured to say a few words of consolation he could only express his heartfelt sympathy poor william said he dear lovely child he now sleeps with his angel mother who that had seen him bright and joyous in his young beauty but must weep over his untimely loss to die so miserably to feel the murderers grasp how much more a murdered that could destroy radiant innocence poor little fellow one only consolation have we his friends mourn and weep but he is at rest the pang is over his sufferings are at an end for ever a sod covers his gentle form and he knows no pain he can no longer be a subject for pity we must reserve that for his miserable survivors ,Frankenstein
clerval spoke thus as we hurried through the streets the words impressed themselves on my mind and i remembered them afterwards in solitude but now as soon as the horses arrived i hurried into a cabriolet and bade farewell to my friend ,Frankenstein
my journey was very melancholy at first i wished to hurry on for i longed to console and sympathise with my loved and sorrowing friends but when i drew near my native town i slackened my progress i could hardly sustain the multitude of feelings that crowded into my mind i passed through scenes familiar to my youth but which i had not seen for nearly six years how altered every thing might be during that time one sudden and desolating change had taken place but a thousand little circumstances might have by degrees worked other alterations which although they were done more tranquilly might not be the less decisive fear overcame me i dared no advance dreading a thousand nameless evils that made me tremble although i was unable to define them ,Frankenstein
i remained two days at lausanne in this painful state of mind i contemplated the lake the waters were placid all around was calm and the snowy mountains the palaces of nature were not changed by degrees the calm and heavenly scene restored me and i continued my journey towards geneva ,Frankenstein
the road ran by the side of the lake which became narrower as i approached my native town i discovered more distinctly the black sides of jura and the bright summit of mont blanc i wept like a child dear mountains my own beautiful lake how do you welcome your wanderer your summits are clear the sky and lake are blue and placid is this to prognosticate peace or to mock at my unhappiness ,Frankenstein
i fear my friend that i shall render myself tedious by dwelling on these preliminary circumstances but they were days of comparative happiness and i think of them with pleasure my country my beloved country who but a native can tell the delight i took in again beholding thy streams thy mountains and more than all thy lovely lake ,Frankenstein
yet as i drew nearer home grief and fear again overcame me night also closed around and when i could hardly see the dark mountains i felt still more gloomily the picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil and i foresaw obscurely that i was destined to become the most wretched of human beings alas i prophesied truly and failed only in one single circumstance that in all the misery i imagined and dreaded i did not conceive the hundredth part of the anguish i was destined to endure ,Frankenstein
it was completely dark when i arrived in the environs of geneva the gates of the town were already shut and i was obliged to pass the night at secheron a village at the distance of half a league from the city the sky was serene and as i was unable to rest i resolved to visit the spot where my poor william had been murdered as i could not pass through the town i was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at plainpalais during this short voyage i saw the lightning playing on the summit of mont blanc in the most beautiful figures the storm appeared to approach rapidly and on landing i ascended a low hill that i might observe its progress it advanced the heavens were clouded and i soon felt the rain coming slowly in large drops but its violence quickly increased ,Frankenstein
i quitted my seat and walked on although the darkness and storm increased every minute and the thunder burst with a terrific crash over my head it was echoed from salve the juras and the alps of savoy vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes illuminating the lake making it appear like a vast sheet of fire then for an instant every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness until the eye recovered itself from the preceding flash the storm as is often the case in switzerland appeared at once in various parts of the heavens the most violent storm hung exactly north of the town over the part of the lake which lies between the promontory of belrive and the village of copt another storm enlightened jura with faint flashes and another darkened and sometimes disclosed the mle a peaked mountain to the east of the lake ,Frankenstein
while i watched the tempest so beautiful yet terrific i wandered on with a hasty step this noble war in the sky elevated my spirits i clasped my hands and exclaimed aloud william dear angel this is thy funeral this thy dirge as i said these words i perceived in the gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me i stood fixed gazing intently i could not be mistaken a flash of lightning illuminated the object and discovered its shape plainly to me its gigantic stature and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs to humanity instantly informed me that it was the wretch the filthy dmon to whom i had given life what did he there could he be i shuddered at the conception the murderer of my brother no sooner did that idea cross my imagination than i became convinced of its truth my teeth chattered and i was forced to lean against a tree for support the figure passed me quickly and i lost it in the gloom nothing in human shape could have destroyed the fair child he was the murderer i could not doubt it the mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the fact i thought of pursuing the devil but it would have been in vain for another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly perpendicular ascent of mont salve a hill that bounds plainpalais on the south he soon reached the summit and disappeared ,Frankenstein
i remained motionless the thunder ceased but the rain still continued and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness i revolved in my mind the events which i had until now sought to forget the whole train of my progress toward the creation the appearance of the works of my own hands at my bedside its departure two years had now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life and was this his first crime alas i had turned loose into the world a depraved wretch whose delight was in carnage and misery had he not murdered my brother ,Frankenstein
no one can conceive the anguish i suffered during the remainder of the night which i spent cold and wet in the open air but i did not feel the inconvenience of the weather my imagination was busy in scenes of evil and despair i considered the being whom i had cast among mankind and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes of horror such as the deed which he had now done nearly in the light of my own vampire my own spirit let loose from the grave and forced to destroy all that was dear to me ,Frankenstein
day dawned and i directed my steps towards the town the gates were open and i hastened to my fathers house my first thought was to discover what i knew of the murderer and cause instant pursuit to be made but i paused when i reflected on the story that i had to tell a being whom i myself had formed and endued with life had met me at midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain i remembered also the nervous fever with which i had been seized just at the time that i dated my creation and which would give an air of delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable i well knew that if any other had communicated such a relation to me i should have looked upon it as the ravings of insanity besides the strange nature of the animal would elude all pursuit even if i were so far credited as to persuade my relatives to commence it and then of what use would be pursuit who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the overhanging sides of mont salve these reflections determined me and i resolved to remain silent ,Frankenstein
six years had elapsed passed in a dream but for one indelible trace and i stood in the same place where i had last embraced my father before my departure for ingolstadt beloved and venerable parent he still remained to me i gazed on the picture of my mother which stood over the mantelpiece it was an historical subject painted at my fathers desire and represented caroline beaufort in an agony of despair kneeling by the coffin of her dead father her garb was rustic and her cheek pale but there was an air of dignity and beauty that hardly permitted the sentiment of pity below this picture was a miniature of william and my tears flowed when i looked upon it while i was thus engaged ernest entered he had heard me arrive and hastened to welcome me welcome my dearest victor said he ah i wish you had come three months ago and then you would have found us all joyous and delighted you come to us now to share a misery which nothing can alleviate yet your presence will i hope revive our father who seems sinking under his misfortune and your persuasions will induce poor elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting selfaccusationspoor william he was our darling and our pride ,Frankenstein
tears unrestrained fell from my brothers eyes a sense of mortal agony crept over my frame before i had only imagined the wretchedness of my desolated home the reality came on me as a new and a not less terrible disaster i tried to calm ernest i enquired more minutely concerning my father and here i named my cousin ,Frankenstein
the murderer discovered good god how can that be who could attempt to pursue him it is impossible one might as well try to overtake the winds or confine a mountainstream with a straw i saw him too he was free last night ,Frankenstein
i do not know what you mean replied my brother in accents of wonder but to us the discovery we have made completes our misery no one would believe it at first and even now elizabeth will not be convinced notwithstanding all the evidence indeed who would credit that justine moritz who was so amiable and fond of all the family could suddenly become so capable of so frightful so appalling a crime ,Frankenstein
no one did at first but several circumstances came out that have almost forced conviction upon us and her own behaviour has been so confused as to add to the evidence of facts a weight that i fear leaves no hope for doubt but she will be tried today and you will then hear all ,Frankenstein
he then related that the morning on which the murder of poor william had been discovered justine had been taken ill and confined to her bed for several days during this interval one of the servants happening to examine the apparel she had worn on the night of the murder had discovered in her pocket the picture of my mother which had been judged to be the temptation of the murderer the servant instantly showed it to one of the others who without saying a word to any of the family went to a magistrate and upon their deposition justine was apprehended on being charged with the fact the poor girl confirmed the suspicion in a great measure by her extreme confusion of manner ,Frankenstein
at that instant my father entered i saw unhappiness deeply impressed on his countenance but he endeavoured to welcome me cheerfully and after we had exchanged our mournful greeting would have introduced some other topic than that of our disaster had not ernest exclaimed good god papa victor says that he knows who was the murderer of poor william ,Frankenstein
this speech calmed me i was firmly convinced in my own mind that justine and indeed every human being was guiltless of this murder i had no fear therefore that any circumstantial evidence could be brought forward strong enough to convict her my tale was not one to announce publicly its astounding horror would be looked upon as madness by the vulgar did any one indeed exist except i the creator who would believe unless his senses convinced him in the existence of the living monument of presumption and rash ignorance which i had let loose upon the world ,Frankenstein
we were soon joined by elizabeth time had altered her since i last beheld her it had endowed her with loveliness surpassing the beauty of her childish years there was the same candour the same vivacity but it was allied to an expression more full of sensibility and intellect she welcomed me with the greatest affection your arrival my dear cousin said she fills me with hope you perhaps will find some means to justify my poor guiltless justine alas who is safe if she be convicted of crime i rely on her innocence as certainly as i do upon my own our misfortune is doubly hard to us we have not only lost that lovely darling boy but this poor girl whom i sincerely love is to be torn away by even a worse fate if she is condemned i never shall know joy more but she will not i am sure she will not and then i shall be happy again even after the sad death of my little william ,Frankenstein
how kind and generous you are every one else believes in her guilt and that made me wretched for i knew that it was impossible and to see every one else prejudiced in so deadly a manner rendered me hopeless and despairing she wept ,Frankenstein
dearest niece said my father dry your tears if she is as you believe innocent rely on the justice of our laws and the activity with which i shall prevent the slightest shadow of partiality ,Frankenstein
we passed a few sad hours until eleven oclock when the trial was to commence my father and the rest of the family being obliged to attend as witnesses i accompanied them to the court during the whole of this wretched mockery of justice i suffered living torture it was to be decided whether the result of my curiosity and lawless devices would cause the death of two of my fellow beings one a smiling babe full of innocence and joy the other far more dreadfully murdered with every aggravation of infamy that could make the murder memorable in horror justine also was a girl of merit and possessed qualities which promised to render her life happy now all was to be obliterated in an ignominious grave and i the cause a thousand times rather would i have confessed myself guilty of the crime ascribed to justine but i was absent when it was committed and such a declaration would have been considered as the ravings of a madman and would not have exculpated her who suffered through me ,Frankenstein
the appearance of justine was calm she was dressed in mourning and her countenance always engaging was rendered by the solemnity of her feelings exquisitely beautiful yet she appeared confident in innocence and did not tremble although gazed on and execrated by thousands for all the kindness which her beauty might otherwise have excited was obliterated in the minds of the spectators by the imagination of the enormity she was supposed to have committed she was tranquil yet her tranquillity was evidently constrained and as her confusion had before been adduced as a proof of her guilt she worked up her mind to an appearance of courage when she entered the court she threw her eyes round it and quickly discovered where we were seated a tear seemed to dim her eye when she saw us but she quickly recovered herself and a look of sorrowful affection seemed to attest her utter guiltlessness ,Frankenstein
the trial began and after the advocate against her had stated the charge several witnesses were called several strange facts combined against her which might have staggered anyone who had not such proof of her innocence as i had she had been out the whole of the night on which the murder had been committed and towards morning had been perceived by a marketwoman not far from the spot where the body of the murdered child had been afterwards found the woman asked her what she did there but she looked very strangely and only returned a confused and unintelligible answer she returned to the house about eight oclock and when one inquired where she had passed the night she replied that she had been looking for the child and demanded earnestly if anything had been heard concerning him when shown the body she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days the picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket and when elizabeth in a faltering voice proved that it was the same which an hour before the child had been missed she had placed round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court ,Frankenstein
justine was called on for her defence as the trial had proceeded her countenance had altered surprise horror and misery were strongly expressed sometimes she struggled with her tears but when she was desired to plead she collected her powers and spoke in an audible although variable voice ,Frankenstein
god knows she said how entirely i am innocent but i do not pretend that my protestations should acquit me i rest my innocence on a plain and simple explanation of the facts which have been adduced against me and i hope the character i have always borne will incline my judges to a favourable interpretation where any circumstance appears doubtful or suspicious ,Frankenstein
she then related that by the permission of elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at chne a village situated at about a league from geneva on her return at about nine oclock she met a man who asked her if she had seen anything of the child who was lost she was alarmed by this account and passed several hours in looking for him when the gates of geneva were shut and she was forced to remain several hours of the night in a barn belonging to a cottage being unwilling to call up the inhabitants to whom she was well known most of the night she spent here watching towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes some steps disturbed her and she awoke it was dawn and she quitted her asylum that she might again endeavour to find my brother if she had gone near the spot where his body lay it was without her knowledge that she had been bewildered when questioned by the marketwoman was not surprising since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor william was yet uncertain concerning the picture she could give no account ,Frankenstein
i know continued the unhappy victim how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but i have no power of explaining it and when i have expressed my utter ignorance i am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket but here also i am checked i believe that i have no enemy on earth and none surely would have been so wicked as to destroy me wantonly did the murderer place it there i know of no opportunity afforded him for so doing or if i had why should he have stolen the jewel to part with it again so soon ,Frankenstein
i commit my cause to the justice of my judges yet i see no room for hope i beg permission to have a few witnesses examined concerning my character and if their testimony shall not overweigh my supposed guilt i must be condemned although i would pledge my salvation on my innocence ,Frankenstein
several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward elizabeth saw even this last resource her excellent dispositions and irreproachable conduct about to fail the accused when although violently agitated she desired permission to address the court ,Frankenstein
i am said she the cousin of the unhappy child who was murdered or rather his sister for i was educated by and have lived with his parents ever since and even long before his birth it may therefore be judged indecent in me to come forward on this occasion but when i see a fellow creature about to perish through the cowardice of her pretended friends i wish to be allowed to speak that i may say what i know of her character i am well acquainted with the accused i have lived in the same house with her at one time for five and at another for nearly two years during all that period she appeared to me the most amiable and benevolent of human creatures she nursed madame frankenstein my aunt in her last illness with the greatest affection and care and afterwards attended her own mother during a tedious illness in a manner that excited the admiration of all who knew her after which she again lived in my uncles house where she was beloved by all the family she was warmly attached to the child who is now dead and acted towards him like a most affectionate mother for my own part i do not hesitate to say that notwithstanding all the evidence produced against her i believe and rely on her perfect innocence she had no temptation for such an action as to the bauble on which the chief proof rests if she had earnestly desired it i should have willingly given it to her so much do i esteem and value her ,Frankenstein
a murmur of approbation followed elizabeths simple and powerful appeal but it was excited by her generous interference and not in favour of poor justine on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence charging her with the blackest ingratitude she herself wept as elizabeth spoke but she did not answer my own agitation and anguish was extreme during the whole trial i believed in her innocence i knew it could the dmon who had i did not for a minute doubt murdered my brother also in his hellish sport have betrayed the innocent to death and ignominy i could not sustain the horror of my situation and when i perceived that the popular voice and the countenances of the judges had already condemned my unhappy victim i rushed out of the court in agony the tortures of the accused did not equal mine she was sustained by innocence but the fangs of remorse tore my bosom and would not forgo their hold ,Frankenstein
i passed a night of unmingled wretchedness in the morning i went to the court my lips and throat were parched i dared not ask the fatal question but i was known and the officer guessed the cause of my visit the ballots had been thrown they were all black and justine was condemned ,Frankenstein
i cannot pretend to describe what i then felt i had before experienced sensations of horror and i have endeavoured to bestow upon them adequate expressions but words cannot convey an idea of the heartsickening despair that i then endured the person to whom i addressed myself added that justine had already confessed her guilt that evidence he observed was hardly required in so glaring a case but i am glad of it and indeed none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so decisive ,Frankenstein
this was strange and unexpected intelligence what could it mean had my eyes deceived me and was i really as mad as the whole world would believe me to be if i disclosed the object of my suspicions i hastened to return home and elizabeth eagerly demanded the result ,Frankenstein
this was a dire blow to poor elizabeth who had relied with firmness upon justines innocence alas said she how shall i ever again believe in human goodness justine whom i loved and esteemed as my sister how could she put on those smiles of innocence only to betray her mild eyes seemed incapable of any severity or guile and yet she has committed a murder ,Frankenstein
soon after we heard that the poor victim had expressed a desire to see my cousin my father wished her not to go but said that he left it to her own judgment and feelings to decide yes said elizabeth i will go although she is guilty and you victor shall accompany me i cannot go alone the idea of this visit was torture to me yet i could not refuse ,Frankenstein
we entered the gloomy prison chamber and beheld justine sitting on some straw at the farther end her hands were manacled and her head rested on her knees she rose on seeing us enter and when we were left alone with her she threw herself at the feet of elizabeth weeping bitterly my cousin wept also ,Frankenstein
rise my poor girl said elizabeth why do you kneel if you are innocent i am not one of your enemies i believed you guiltless notwithstanding every evidence until i heard that you had yourself declared your guilt that report you say is false and be assured dear justine that nothing can shake my confidence in you for a moment but your own confession ,Frankenstein
i did confess but i confessed a lie i confessed that i might obtain absolution but now that falsehood lies heavier at my heart than all my other sins the god of heaven forgive me ever since i was condemned my confessor has besieged me he threatened and menaced until i almost began to think that i was the monster that he said i was he threatened excommunication and hell fire in my last moments if i continued obdurate dear lady i had none to support me all looked on me as a wretch doomed to ignominy and perdition what could i do in an evil hour i subscribed to a lie and now only am i truly miserable ,Frankenstein
she paused weeping and then continued i thought with horror my sweet lady that you should believe your justine whom your blessed aunt had so highly honoured and whom you loved was a creature capable of a crime which none but the devil himself could have perpetrated dear william dearest blessed child i soon shall see you again in heaven where we shall all be happy and that consoles me going as i am to suffer ignominy and death ,Frankenstein
oh justine forgive me for having for one moment distrusted you why did you confess but do not mourn dear girl do not fear i will proclaim i will prove your innocence i will melt the stony hearts of your enemies by my tears and prayers you shall not die you my playfellow my companion my sister perish on the scaffold no no i never could survive so horrible a misfortune ,Frankenstein
justine shook her head mournfully i do not fear to die she said that pang is past god raises my weakness and gives me courage to endure the worst i leave a sad and bitter world and if you remember me and think of me as of one unjustly condemned i am resigned to the fate awaiting me learn from me dear lady to submit in patience to the will of heaven ,Frankenstein
during this conversation i had retired to a corner of the prison room where i could conceal the horrid anguish that possessed me despair who dared talk of that the poor victim who on the morrow was to pass the awful boundary between life and death felt not as i did such deep and bitter agony i gnashed my teeth and ground them together uttering a groan that came from my inmost soul justine started when she saw who it was she approached me and said dear sir you are very kind to visit me you i hope do not believe that i am guilty ,Frankenstein
i truly thank him in these last moments i feel the sincerest gratitude towards those who think of me with kindness how sweet is the affection of others to such a wretch as i am it removes more than half my misfortune and i feel as if i could die in peace now that my innocence is acknowledged by you dear lady and your cousin ,Frankenstein
thus the poor sufferer tried to comfort others and herself she indeed gained the resignation she desired but i the true murderer felt the neverdying worm alive in my bosom which allowed of no hope or consolation elizabeth also wept and was unhappy but hers also was the misery of innocence which like a cloud that passes over the fair moon for a while hides but cannot tarnish its brightness anguish and despair had penetrated into the core of my heart i bore a hell within me which nothing could extinguish we stayed several hours with justine and it was with great difficulty that elizabeth could tear herself away i wish cried she that i were to die with you i cannot live in this world of misery ,Frankenstein
justine assumed an air of cheerfulness while she with difficulty repressed her bitter tears she embraced elizabeth and said in a voice of halfsuppressed emotion farewell sweet lady dearest elizabeth my beloved and only friend may heaven in its bounty bless and preserve you may this be the last misfortune that you will ever suffer live and be happy and make others so ,Frankenstein
and on the morrow justine died elizabeths heartrending eloquence failed to move the judges from their settled conviction in the criminality of the saintly sufferer my passionate and indignant appeals were lost upon them and when i received their cold answers and heard the harsh unfeeling reasoning of these men my purposed avowal died away on my lips thus i might proclaim myself a madman but not revoke the sentence passed upon my wretched victim she perished on the scaffold as a murderess ,Frankenstein
from the tortures of my own heart i turned to contemplate the deep and voiceless grief of my elizabeth this also was my doing and my fathers woe and the desolation of that late so smiling home all was the work of my thriceaccursed hands ye weep unhappy ones but these are not your last tears again shall you raise the funeral wail and the sound of your lamentations shall again and again be heard frankenstein your son your kinsman your early muchloved friend he who would spend each vital drop of blood for your sakes who has no thought nor sense of joy except as it is mirrored also in your dear countenances who would fill the air with blessings and spend his life in serving youhe bids you weep to shed countless tears happy beyond his hopes if thus inexorable fate be satisfied and if the destruction pause before the peace of the grave have succeeded to your sad torments ,Frankenstein
nothing is more painful to the human mind than after the feelings have been worked up by a quick succession of events the dead calmness of inaction and certainty which follows and deprives the soul both of hope and fear justine died she rested and i was alive the blood flowed freely in my veins but a weight of despair and remorse pressed on my heart which nothing could remove sleep fled from my eyes i wandered like an evil spirit for i had committed deeds of mischief beyond description horrible and more much more i persuaded myself was yet behind yet my heart overflowed with kindness and the love of virtue i had begun life with benevolent intentions and thirsted for the moment when i should put them in practice and make myself useful to my fellow beings now all was blasted instead of that serenity of conscience which allowed me to look back upon the past with selfsatisfaction and from thence to gather promise of new hopes i was seized by remorse and the sense of guilt which hurried me away to a hell of intense tortures such as no language can describe ,Frankenstein
this state of mind preyed upon my health which had perhaps never entirely recovered from the first shock it had sustained i shunned the face of man all sound of joy or complacency was torture to me solitude was my only consolationdeep dark deathlike solitude ,Frankenstein
my father observed with pain the alteration perceptible in my disposition and habits and endeavoured by arguments deduced from the feelings of his serene conscience and guiltless life to inspire me with fortitude and awaken in me the courage to dispel the dark cloud which brooded over me do you think victor said he that i do not suffer also no one could love a child more than i loved your brothertears came into his eyes as he spokebut is it not a duty to the survivors that we should refrain from augmenting their unhappiness by an appearance of immoderate grief it is also a duty owed to yourself for excessive sorrow prevents improvement or enjoyment or even the discharge of daily usefulness without which no man is fit for society ,Frankenstein
this advice although good was totally inapplicable to my case i should have been the first to hide my grief and console my friends if remorse had not mingled its bitterness and terror its alarm with my other sensations now i could only answer my father with a look of despair and endeavour to hide myself from his view ,Frankenstein
about this time we retired to our house at belrive this change was particularly agreeable to me the shutting of the gates regularly at ten oclock and the impossibility of remaining on the lake after that hour had rendered our residence within the walls of geneva very irksome to me i was now free often after the rest of the family had retired for the night i took the boat and passed many hours upon the water sometimes with my sails set i was carried by the wind and sometimes after rowing into the middle of the lake i left the boat to pursue its own course and gave way to my own miserable reflections i was often tempted when all was at peace around me and i the only unquiet thing that wandered restless in a scene so beautiful and heavenlyif i except some bat or the frogs whose harsh and interrupted croaking was heard only when i approached the shoreoften i say i was tempted to plunge into the silent lake that the waters might close over me and my calamities for ever but i was restrained when i thought of the heroic and suffering elizabeth whom i tenderly loved and whose existence was bound up in mine i thought also of my father and surviving brother should i by my base desertion leave them exposed and unprotected to the malice of the fiend whom i had let loose among them ,Frankenstein
at these moments i wept bitterly and wished that peace would revisit my mind only that i might afford them consolation and happiness but that could not be remorse extinguished every hope i had been the author of unalterable evils and i lived in daily fear lest the monster whom i had created should perpetrate some new wickedness i had an obscure feeling that all was not over and that he would still commit some signal crime which by its enormity should almost efface the recollection of the past there was always scope for fear so long as anything i loved remained behind my abhorrence of this fiend cannot be conceived when i thought of him i gnashed my teeth my eyes became inflamed and i ardently wished to extinguish that life which i had so thoughtlessly bestowed when i reflected on his crimes and malice my hatred and revenge burst all bounds of moderation i would have made a pilgrimage to the highest peak of the andes could i when there have precipitated him to their base i wished to see him again that i might wreak the utmost extent of abhorrence on his head and avenge the deaths of william and justine ,Frankenstein
our house was the house of mourning my fathers health was deeply shaken by the horror of the recent events elizabeth was sad and desponding she no longer took delight in her ordinary occupations all pleasure seemed to her sacrilege toward the dead eternal woe and tears she then thought was the just tribute she should pay to innocence so blasted and destroyed she was no longer that happy creature who in earlier youth wandered with me on the banks of the lake and talked with ecstasy of our future prospects the first of those sorrows which are sent to wean us from the earth had visited her and its dimming influence quenched her dearest smiles ,Frankenstein
when i reflect my dear cousin said she on the miserable death of justine moritz i no longer see the world and its works as they before appeared to me before i looked upon the accounts of vice and injustice that i read in books or heard from others as tales of ancient days or imaginary evils at least they were remote and more familiar to reason than to the imagination but now misery has come home and men appear to me as monsters thirsting for each others blood yet i am certainly unjust everybody believed that poor girl to be guilty and if she could have committed the crime for which she suffered assuredly she would have been the most depraved of human creatures for the sake of a few jewels to have murdered the son of her benefactor and friend a child whom she had nursed from its birth and appeared to love as if it had been her own i could not consent to the death of any human being but certainly i should have thought such a creature unfit to remain in the society of men but she was innocent i know i feel she was innocent you are of the same opinion and that confirms me alas victor when falsehood can look so like the truth who can assure themselves of certain happiness i feel as if i were walking on the edge of a precipice towards which thousands are crowding and endeavouring to plunge me into the abyss william and justine were assassinated and the murderer escapes he walks about the world free and perhaps respected but even if i were condemned to suffer on the scaffold for the same crimes i would not change places with such a wretch ,Frankenstein
i listened to this discourse with the extremest agony i not in deed but in effect was the true murderer elizabeth read my anguish in my countenance and kindly taking my hand said my dearest friend you must calm yourself these events have affected me god knows how deeply but i am not so wretched as you are there is an expression of despair and sometimes of revenge in your countenance that makes me tremble dear victor banish these dark passions remember the friends around you who centre all their hopes in you have we lost the power of rendering you happy ah while we love while we are true to each other here in this land of peace and beauty your native country we may reap every tranquil blessingwhat can disturb our peace ,Frankenstein
and could not such words from her whom i fondly prized before every other gift of fortune suffice to chase away the fiend that lurked in my heart even as she spoke i drew near to her as if in terror lest at that very moment the destroyer had been near to rob me of her ,Frankenstein
thus not the tenderness of friendship nor the beauty of earth nor of heaven could redeem my soul from woe the very accents of love were ineffectual i was encompassed by a cloud which no beneficial influence could penetrate the wounded deer dragging its fainting limbs to some untrodden brake there to gaze upon the arrow which had pierced it and to die was but a type of me ,Frankenstein
sometimes i could cope with the sullen despair that overwhelmed me but sometimes the whirlwind passions of my soul drove me to seek by bodily exercise and by change of place some relief from my intolerable sensations it was during an access of this kind that i suddenly left my home and bending my steps towards the near alpine valleys sought in the magnificence the eternity of such scenes to forget myself and my ephemeral because human sorrows my wanderings were directed towards the valley of chamounix i had visited it frequently during my boyhood six years had passed since then i was a wreck but nought had changed in those savage and enduring scenes ,Frankenstein
i performed the first part of my journey on horseback i afterwards hired a mule as the more surefooted and least liable to receive injury on these rugged roads the weather was fine it was about the middle of the month of august nearly two months after the death of justine that miserable epoch from which i dated all my woe the weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as i plunged yet deeper in the ravine of arve the immense mountains and precipices that overhung me on every side the sound of the river raging among the rocks and the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as omnipotenceand i ceased to fear or to bend before any being less almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements here displayed in their most terrific guise still as i ascended higher the valley assumed a more magnificent and astonishing character ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains the impetuous arve and cottages every here and there peeping forth from among the trees formed a scene of singular beauty but it was augmented and rendered sublime by the mighty alps whose white and shining pyramids and domes towered above all as belonging to another earth the habitations of another race of beings ,Frankenstein
i passed the bridge of plissier where the ravine which the river forms opened before me and i began to ascend the mountain that overhangs it soon after i entered the valley of chamounix this valley is more wonderful and sublime but not so beautiful and picturesque as that of servox through which i had just passed the high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries but i saw no more ruined castles and fertile fields immense glaciers approached the road i heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and marked the smoke of its passage mont blanc the supreme and magnificent mont blanc raised itself from the surrounding aiguilles and its tremendous dme overlooked the valley ,Frankenstein
a tingling longlost sense of pleasure often came across me during this journey some turn in the road some new object suddenly perceived and recognised reminded me of days gone by and were associated with the lighthearted gaiety of boyhood the very winds whispered in soothing accents and maternal nature bade me weep no more then again the kindly influence ceased to acti found myself fettered again to grief and indulging in all the misery of reflection then i spurred on my animal striving so to forget the world my fears and more than all myselfor in a more desperate fashion i alighted and threw myself on the grass weighed down by horror and despair ,Frankenstein
at length i arrived at the village of chamounix exhaustion succeeded to the extreme fatigue both of body and of mind which i had endured for a short space of time i remained at the window watching the pallid lightnings that played above mont blanc and listening to the rushing of the arve which pursued its noisy way beneath the same lulling sounds acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations when i placed my head upon my pillow sleep crept over me i felt it as it came and blessed the giver of oblivion ,Frankenstein
i spent the following day roaming through the valley i stood beside the sources of the arveiron which take their rise in a glacier that with slow pace is advancing down from the summit of the hills to barricade the valley the abrupt sides of vast mountains were before me the icy wall of the glacier overhung me a few shattered pines were scattered around and the solemn silence of this glorious presencechamber of imperial nature was broken only by the brawling waves or the fall of some vast fragment the thunder sound of the avalanche or the cracking reverberated along the mountains of the accumulated ice which through the silent working of immutable laws was ever and anon rent and torn as if it had been but a plaything in their hands these sublime and magnificent scenes afforded me the greatest consolation that i was capable of receiving they elevated me from all littleness of feeling and although they did not remove my grief they subdued and tranquillised it in some degree also they diverted my mind from the thoughts over which it had brooded for the last month i retired to rest at night my slumbers as it were waited on and ministered to by the assemblance of grand shapes which i had contemplated during the day they congregated round me the unstained snowy mountaintop the glittering pinnacle the pine woods and ragged bare ravine the eagle soaring amidst the cloudsthey all gathered round me and bade me be at peace ,Frankenstein
where had they fled when the next morning i awoke all of soulinspiriting fled with sleep and dark melancholy clouded every thought the rain was pouring in torrents and thick mists hid the summits of the mountains so that i even saw not the faces of those mighty friends still i would penetrate their misty veil and seek them in their cloudy retreats what were rain and storm to me my mule was brought to the door and i resolved to ascend to the summit of montanvert i remembered the effect that the view of the tremendous and evermoving glacier had produced upon my mind when i first saw it it had then filled me with a sublime ecstasy that gave wings to the soul and allowed it to soar from the obscure world to light and joy the sight of the awful and majestic in nature had indeed always the effect of solemnising my mind and causing me to forget the passing cares of life i determined to go without a guide for i was well acquainted with the path and the presence of another would destroy the solitary grandeur of the scene ,Frankenstein
the ascent is precipitous but the path is cut into continual and short windings which enable you to surmount the perpendicularity of the mountain it is a scene terrifically desolate in a thousand spots the traces of the winter avalanche may be perceived where trees lie broken and strewed on the ground some entirely destroyed others bent leaning upon the jutting rocks of the mountain or transversely upon other trees the path as you ascend higher is intersected by ravines of snow down which stones continually roll from above one of them is particularly dangerous as the slightest sound such as even speaking in a loud voice produces a concussion of air sufficient to draw destruction upon the head of the speaker the pines are not tall or luxuriant but they are sombre and add an air of severity to the scene i looked on the valley beneath vast mists were rising from the rivers which ran through it and curling in thick wreaths around the opposite mountains whose summits were hid in the uniform clouds while rain poured from the dark sky and added to the melancholy impression i received from the objects around me alas why does man boast of sensibilities superior to those apparent in the brute it only renders them more necessary beings if our impulses were confined to hunger thirst and desire we might be nearly free but now we are moved by every wind that blows and a chance word or scene that that word may convey to us ,Frankenstein
we rest a dream has power to poison sleep we rise one wandring thought pollutes the day we feel conceive or reason laugh or weep embrace fond woe or cast our cares away it is the same for be it joy or sorrow the path of its departure still is free mans yesterday may neer be like his morrow nought may endure but mutability ,Frankenstein
it was nearly noon when i arrived at the top of the ascent for some time i sat upon the rock that overlooks the sea of ice a mist covered both that and the surrounding mountains presently a breeze dissipated the cloud and i descended upon the glacier the surface is very uneven rising like the waves of a troubled sea descending low and interspersed by rifts that sink deep the field of ice is almost a league in width but i spent nearly two hours in crossing it the opposite mountain is a bare perpendicular rock from the side where i now stood montanvert was exactly opposite at the distance of a league and above it rose mont blanc in awful majesty i remained in a recess of the rock gazing on this wonderful and stupendous scene the sea or rather the vast river of ice wound among its dependent mountains whose aerial summits hung over its recesses their icy and glittering peaks shone in the sunlight over the clouds my heart which was before sorrowful now swelled with something like joy i exclaimed wandering spirits if indeed ye wander and do not rest in your narrow beds allow me this faint happiness or take me as your companion away from the joys of life ,Frankenstein
as i said this i suddenly beheld the figure of a man at some distance advancing towards me with superhuman speed he bounded over the crevices in the ice among which i had walked with caution his stature also as he approached seemed to exceed that of man i was troubled a mist came over my eyes and i felt a faintness seize me but i was quickly restored by the cold gale of the mountains i perceived as the shape came nearer sight tremendous and abhorred that it was the wretch whom i had created i trembled with rage and horror resolving to wait his approach and then close with him in mortal combat he approached his countenance bespoke bitter anguish combined with disdain and malignity while its unearthly ugliness rendered it almost too horrible for human eyes but i scarcely observed this rage and hatred had at first deprived me of utterance and i recovered only to overwhelm him with words expressive of furious detestation and contempt ,Frankenstein
devil i exclaimed do you dare approach me and do not you fear the fierce vengeance of my arm wreaked on your miserable head begone vile insect or rather stay that i may trample you to dust and oh that i could with the extinction of your miserable existence restore those victims whom you have so diabolically murdered ,Frankenstein
i expected this reception said the dmon all men hate the wretched how then must i be hated who am miserable beyond all living things yet you my creator detest and spurn me thy creature to whom thou art bound by ties only dissoluble by the annihilation of one of us you purpose to kill me how dare you sport thus with life do your duty towards me and i will do mine towards you and the rest of mankind if you will comply with my conditions i will leave them and you at peace but if you refuse i will glut the maw of death until it be satiated with the blood of your remaining friends ,Frankenstein
abhorred monster fiend that thou art the tortures of hell are too mild a vengeance for thy crimes wretched devil you reproach me with your creation come on then that i may extinguish the spark which i so negligently bestowed ,Frankenstein
be calm i entreat you to hear me before you give vent to your hatred on my devoted head have i not suffered enough that you seek to increase my misery life although it may only be an accumulation of anguish is dear to me and i will defend it remember thou hast made me more powerful than thyself my height is superior to thine my joints more supple but i will not be tempted to set myself in opposition to thee i am thy creature and i will be even mild and docile to my natural lord and king if thou wilt also perform thy part the which thou owest me oh frankenstein be not equitable to every other and trample upon me alone to whom thy justice and even thy clemency and affection is most due remember that i am thy creature i ought to be thy adam but i am rather the fallen angel whom thou drivest from joy for no misdeed everywhere i see bliss from which i alone am irrevocably excluded i was benevolent and good misery made me a fiend make me happy and i shall again be virtuous ,Frankenstein
how can i move thee will no entreaties cause thee to turn a favourable eye upon thy creature who implores thy goodness and compassion believe me frankenstein i was benevolent my soul glowed with love and humanity but am i not alone miserably alone you my creator abhor me what hope can i gather from your fellow creatures who owe me nothing they spurn and hate me the desert mountains and dreary glaciers are my refuge i have wandered here many days the caves of ice which i only do not fear are a dwelling to me and the only one which man does not grudge these bleak skies i hail for they are kinder to me than your fellow beings if the multitude of mankind knew of my existence they would do as you do and arm themselves for my destruction shall i not then hate them who abhor me i will keep no terms with my enemies i am miserable and they shall share my wretchedness yet it is in your power to recompense me and deliver them from an evil which it only remains for you to make so great that not only you and your family but thousands of others shall be swallowed up in the whirlwinds of its rage let your compassion be moved and do not disdain me listen to my tale when you have heard that abandon or commiserate me as you shall judge that i deserve but hear me the guilty are allowed by human laws bloody as they are to speak in their own defence before they are condemned listen to me frankenstein you accuse me of murder and yet you would with a satisfied conscience destroy your own creature oh praise the eternal justice of man yet i ask you not to spare me listen to me and then if you can and if you will destroy the work of your hands ,Frankenstein
why do you call to my remembrance i rejoined circumstances of which i shudder to reflect that i have been the miserable origin and author cursed be the day abhorred devil in which you first saw light cursed although i curse myself be the hands that formed you you have made me wretched beyond expression you have left me no power to consider whether i am just to you or not begone relieve me from the sight of your detested form ,Frankenstein
thus i relieve thee my creator he said and placed his hated hands before my eyes which i flung from me with violence thus i take from thee a sight which you abhor still thou canst listen to me and grant me thy compassion by the virtues that i once possessed i demand this from you hear my tale it is long and strange and the temperature of this place is not fitting to your fine sensations come to the hut upon the mountain the sun is yet high in the heavens before it descends to hide itself behind your snowy precipices and illuminate another world you will have heard my story and can decide on you it rests whether i quit for ever the neighbourhood of man and lead a harmless life or become the scourge of your fellow creatures and the author of your own speedy ruin ,Frankenstein
as he said this he led the way across the ice i followed my heart was full and i did not answer him but as i proceeded i weighed the various arguments that he had used and determined at least to listen to his tale i was partly urged by curiosity and compassion confirmed my resolution i had hitherto supposed him to be the murderer of my brother and i eagerly sought a confirmation or denial of this opinion for the first time also i felt what the duties of a creator towards his creature were and that i ought to render him happy before i complained of his wickedness these motives urged me to comply with his demand we crossed the ice therefore and ascended the opposite rock the air was cold and the rain again began to descend we entered the hut the fiend with an air of exultation i with a heavy heart and depressed spirits but i consented to listen and seating myself by the fire which my odious companion had lighted he thus began his tale ,Frankenstein
it is with considerable difficulty that i remember the original era of my being all the events of that period appear confused and indistinct a strange multiplicity of sensations seized me and i saw felt heard and smelt at the same time and it was indeed a long time before i learned to distinguish between the operations of my various senses by degrees i remember a stronger light pressed upon my nerves so that i was obliged to shut my eyes darkness then came over me and troubled me but hardly had i felt this when by opening my eyes as i now suppose the light poured in upon me again i walked and i believe descended but i presently found a great alteration in my sensations before dark and opaque bodies had surrounded me impervious to my touch or sight but i now found that i could wander on at liberty with no obstacles which i could not either surmount or avoid the light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as i walked i sought a place where i could receive shade this was the forest near ingolstadt and here i lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until i felt tormented by hunger and thirst this roused me from my nearly dormant state and i ate some berries which i found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground i slaked my thirst at the brook and then lying down was overcome by sleep ,Frankenstein
it was dark when i awoke i felt cold also and half frightened as it were instinctively finding myself so desolate before i had quitted your apartment on a sensation of cold i had covered myself with some clothes but these were insufficient to secure me from the dews of night i was a poor helpless miserable wretch i knew and could distinguish nothing but feeling pain invade me on all sides i sat down and wept ,Frankenstein
soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure i started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees the moon i gazed with a kind of wonder it moved slowly but it enlightened my path and i again went out in search of berries i was still cold when under one of the trees i found a huge cloak with which i covered myself and sat down upon the ground no distinct ideas occupied my mind all was confused i felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me the only object that i could distinguish was the bright moon and i fixed my eyes on that with pleasure ,Frankenstein
several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when i began to distinguish my sensations from each other i gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage i was delighted when i first discovered that a pleasant sound which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes i began also to observe with greater accuracy the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me sometimes i tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable sometimes i wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again ,Frankenstein
the moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while i still remained in the forest my sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas my eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms i distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another i found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing ,Frankenstein
one day when i was oppressed by cold i found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth i experienced from it in my joy i thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain how strange i thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects i examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood i quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn i was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire the wet wood which i had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed i reflected on this and by touching the various branches i discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood that i might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire when night came on and brought sleep with it i was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished i covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it and then spreading my cloak i lay on the ground and sank into sleep ,Frankenstein
it was morning when i awoke and my first care was to visit the fire i uncovered it and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame i observed this also and contrived a fan of branches which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished when night came again i found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food for i found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted and tasted much more savoury than the berries i gathered from the trees i tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers i found that the berries were spoiled by this operation and the nuts and roots much improved ,Frankenstein
food however became scarce and i often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger when i found this i resolved to quit the place that i had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants i experienced would be more easily satisfied in this emigration i exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which i had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it i gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty but i was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrapping myself up in my cloak i struck across the wood towards the setting sun i passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country a great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white the appearance was disconsolate and i found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground ,Frankenstein
it was about seven in the morning and i longed to obtain food and shelter at length i perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd this was a new sight to me and i examined the structure with great curiosity finding the door open i entered an old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast he turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quitting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable his appearance different from any i had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me but i was enchanted by the appearance of the hut here the snow and rain could not penetrate the ground was dry and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as pandmonium appeared to the dmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire i greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine the latter however i did not like then overcome by fatigue i lay down among some straw and fell asleep ,Frankenstein
it was noon when i awoke and allured by the warmth of the sun which shone brightly on the white ground i determined to recommence my travels and depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a wallet i found i proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset i arrived at a village how miraculous did this appear the huts the neater cottages and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns the vegetables in the gardens the milk and cheese that i saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages allured my appetite one of the best of these i entered but i had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted the whole village was roused some fled some attacked me until grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons i escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces i had beheld in the village this hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience i dared not enter it my place of refuge was constructed of wood but so low that i could with difficulty sit upright in it no wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks i found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain ,Frankenstein
here then i retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man as soon as morning dawned i crept from my kennel that i might view the adjacent cottage and discover if i could remain in the habitation i had found it was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water one part was open and by that i had crept in but now i covered every crevice by which i might be perceived with stones and wood yet in such a manner that i might move them on occasion to pass out all the light i enjoyed came through the sty and that was sufficient for me ,Frankenstein
having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw i retired for i saw the figure of a man at a distance and i remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power i had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which i purloined and a cup with which i could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat the floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm ,Frankenstein
being thus provided i resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination it was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the raindropping branches and dank earth i ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when i heard a step and looking through a small chink i beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel the girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what i have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb her fair hair was plaited but not adorned she looked patient yet sad i lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk as she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself she followed and they disappeared presently i saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage and the girl was also busied sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard ,Frankenstein
on examining my dwelling i found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood in one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate through this crevice a small room was visible whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture in one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude the young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage but presently she took something out of a drawer which employed her hands and she sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale it was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before the silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love he played a sweet mournful air which i perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet he raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that i felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as i had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food and i withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions ,Frankenstein
soon after this the young man returned bearing on his shoulders a load of wood the girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese she seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire she afterwards continued her work whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots after he had been employed thus about an hour the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together ,Frankenstein
the old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air and they sat down to eat the meal was quickly dispatched the young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures one was old with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love the younger was slight and graceful in his figure and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency the old man returned to the cottage and the youth with tools different from those he had used in the morning directed his steps across the fields ,Frankenstein
night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder i found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure i experienced in watching my human neighbours in the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which i did not understand and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning so soon as he had finished the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds i since found that he read aloud but at that time i knew nothing of the science of words or letters ,Frankenstein
i lay on my straw but i could not sleep i thought of the occurrences of the day what chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and i longed to join them but dared not i remembered too well the treatment i had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct i might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present i would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions ,Frankenstein
this day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it the young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within the old man whom i soon perceived to be blind employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion they performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles ,Frankenstein
they were not entirely happy the young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep i saw no cause for their unhappiness but i was deeply affected by it if such lovely creatures were miserable it was less strange that i an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched yet why were these gentle beings unhappy they possessed a delightful house for such it was in my eyes and every luxury they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry they were dressed in excellent clothes and still more they enjoyed one anothers company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness what did their tears imply did they really express pain i was at first unable to solve these questions but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic ,Frankenstein
a considerable period elapsed before i discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it they often i believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves ,Frankenstein
this trait of kindness moved me sensibly i had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption but when i found that in doing this i inflicted pain on the cottagers i abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which i gathered from a neighbouring wood ,Frankenstein
i discovered also another means through which i was enabled to assist their labours i found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire and during the night i often took his tools the use of which i quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days ,Frankenstein
i remember the first time that i did this the young woman when she opened the door in the morning appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside she uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise i observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden ,Frankenstein
by degrees i made a discovery of still greater moment i found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds i perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers this was indeed a godlike science and i ardently desired to become acquainted with it but i was baffled in every attempt i made for this purpose their pronunciation was quick and the words they uttered not having any apparent connection with visible objects i was unable to discover any clue by which i could unravel the mystery of their reference by great application however and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel i discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse i learned and applied the words fire milk bread and wood i learned also the names of the cottagers themselves the youth and his companion had each of them several names but the old man had only one which was father the girl was called sister or agatha and the youth felix brother or son i cannot describe the delight i felt when i learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them i distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them such as good dearest unhappy ,Frankenstein
i spent the winter in this manner the gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me when they were unhappy i felt depressed when they rejoiced i sympathised in their joys i saw few human beings besides them and if any other happened to enter the cottage their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends the old man i could perceive often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes i found that he called them to cast off their melancholy he would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived but i generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father it was not thus with felix he was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends but if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he addressed the old man ,Frankenstein
i could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers in the midst of poverty and want felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground early in the morning before she had risen he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milkhouse drew water from the well and brought the wood from the outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand in the day i believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him at other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and agatha ,Frankenstein
this reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees i discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked i conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and i ardently longed to comprehend these also but how was that possible when i did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs i improved however sensibly in this science but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation although i applied my whole mind to the endeavour for i easily perceived that although i eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers i ought not to make the attempt until i had first become master of their language which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted ,Frankenstein
i had admired the perfect forms of my cottagerstheir grace beauty and delicate complexions but how was i terrified when i viewed myself in a transparent pool at first i started back unable to believe that it was indeed i who was reflected in the mirror and when i became fully convinced that i was in reality the monster that i am i was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification alas i did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity ,Frankenstein
as the sun became warmer and the light of day longer the snow vanished and i beheld the bare trees and the black earth from this time felix was more employed and the heartmoving indications of impending famine disappeared their food as i afterwards found was coarse but it was wholesome and they procured a sufficiency of it several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced ,Frankenstein
the old man leaning on his son walked each day at noon when it did not rain as i found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters this frequently took place but a high wind quickly dried the earth and the season became far more pleasant than it had been ,Frankenstein
my mode of life in my hovel was uniform during the morning i attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations i slept the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends when they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was starlight i went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage when i returned as often as it was necessary i cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that i had seen done by felix i afterwards found that these labours performed by an invisible hand greatly astonished them and once or twice i heard them on these occasions utter the words good spirit wonderful but i did not then understand the signification of these terms ,Frankenstein
my thoughts now became more active and i longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures i was inquisitive to know why felix appeared so miserable and agatha so sad i thought foolish wretch that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people when i slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father the gentle agatha and the excellent felix flitted before me i looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny i formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them and their reception of me i imagined that they would be disgusted until by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words i should first win their favour and afterwards their love ,Frankenstein
these thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language my organs were indeed harsh but supple and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet i pronounced such words as i understood with tolerable ease it was as the ass and the lapdog yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate although his manners were rude deserved better treatment than blows and execration ,Frankenstein
the pleasant showers and genial warmth of spring greatly altered the aspect of the earth men who before this change seemed to have been hid in caves dispersed themselves and were employed in various arts of cultivation the birds sang in more cheerful notes and the leaves began to bud forth on the trees happy happy earth fit habitation for gods which so short a time before was bleak damp and unwholesome my spirits were elevated by the enchanting appearance of nature the past was blotted from my memory the present was tranquil and the future gilded by bright rays of hope and anticipations of joy ,Frankenstein
spring advanced rapidly the weather became fine and the skies cloudless it surprised me that what before was desert and gloomy should now bloom with the most beautiful flowers and verdure my senses were gratified and refreshed by a thousand scents of delight and a thousand sights of beauty ,Frankenstein
it was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labourthe old man played on his guitar and the children listened to himthat i observed the countenance of felix was melancholy beyond expression he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and i conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his sons sorrow felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door ,Frankenstein
it was a lady on horseback accompanied by a countryman as a guide the lady was dressed in a dark suit and covered with a thick black veil agatha asked a question to which the stranger only replied by pronouncing in a sweet accent the name of felix her voice was musical but unlike that of either of my friends on hearing this word felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil and i beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression her hair of a shining raven black and curiously braided her eyes were dark but gentle although animated her features of a regular proportion and her complexion wondrously fair each cheek tinged with a lovely pink ,Frankenstein
felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which i could hardly have believed it capable his eyes sparkled as his cheek flushed with pleasure and at that moment i thought him as beautiful as the stranger she appeared affected by different feelings wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes she held out her hand to felix who kissed it rapturously and called her as well as i could distinguish his sweet arabian she did not appear to understand him but smiled he assisted her to dismount and dismissing her guide conducted her into the cottage some conversation took place between him and his father and the young stranger knelt at the old mans feet and would have kissed his hand but he raised her and embraced her affectionately ,Frankenstein
i soon perceived that although the stranger uttered articulate sounds and appeared to have a language of her own she was neither understood by nor herself understood the cottagers they made many signs which i did not comprehend but i saw that her presence diffused gladness through the cottage dispelling their sorrow as the sun dissipates the morning mists felix seemed peculiarly happy and with smiles of delight welcomed his arabian agatha the evergentle agatha kissed the hands of the lovely stranger and pointing to her brother made signs which appeared to me to mean that he had been sorrowful until she came some hours passed thus while they by their countenances expressed joy the cause of which i did not comprehend presently i found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language and the idea instantly occurred to me that i should make use of the same instructions to the same end the stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson most of them indeed were those which i had before understood but i profited by the others ,Frankenstein
as night came on agatha and the arabian retired early when they separated felix kissed the hand of the stranger and said good night sweet safie he sat up much longer conversing with his father and by the frequent repetition of her name i conjectured that their lovely guest was the subject of their conversation i ardently desired to understand them and bent every faculty towards that purpose but found it utterly impossible ,Frankenstein
the next morning felix went out to his work and after the usual occupations of agatha were finished the arabian sat at the feet of the old man and taking his guitar played some airs so entrancingly beautiful that they at once drew tears of sorrow and delight from my eyes she sang and her voice flowed in a rich cadence swelling or dying away like a nightingale of the woods ,Frankenstein
when she had finished she gave the guitar to agatha who at first declined it she played a simple air and her voice accompanied it in sweet accents but unlike the wondrous strain of the stranger the old man appeared enraptured and said some words which agatha endeavoured to explain to safie and by which he appeared to wish to express that she bestowed on him the greatest delight by her music ,Frankenstein
the days now passed as peaceably as before with the sole alteration that joy had taken place of sadness in the countenances of my friends safie was always gay and happy she and i improved rapidly in the knowledge of language so that in two months i began to comprehend most of the words uttered by my protectors ,Frankenstein
in the meanwhile also the black ground was covered with herbage and the green banks interspersed with innumerable flowers sweet to the scent and the eyes stars of pale radiance among the moonlight woods the sun became warmer the nights clear and balmy and my nocturnal rambles were an extreme pleasure to me although they were considerably shortened by the late setting and early rising of the sun for i never ventured abroad during daylight fearful of meeting with the same treatment i had formerly endured in the first village which i entered ,Frankenstein
my days were spent in close attention that i might more speedily master the language and i may boast that i improved more rapidly than the arabian who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst i comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken ,Frankenstein
the book from which felix instructed safie was volneys ruins of empires i should not have understood the purport of this book had not felix in reading it given very minute explanations he had chosen this work he said because the declamatory style was framed in imitation of the eastern authors through this work i obtained a cursory knowledge of history and a view of the several empires at present existing in the world it gave me an insight into the manners governments and religions of the different nations of the earth i heard of the slothful asiatics of the stupendous genius and mental activity of the grecians of the wars and wonderful virtue of the early romansof their subsequent degeneratingof the decline of that mighty empire of chivalry christianity and kings i heard of the discovery of the american hemisphere and wept with safie over the hapless fate of its original inhabitants ,Frankenstein
these wonderful narrations inspired me with strange feelings was man indeed at once so powerful so virtuous and magnificent yet so vicious and base he appeared at one time a mere scion of the evil principle and at another as all that can be conceived of noble and godlike to be a great and virtuous man appeared the highest honour that can befall a sensitive being to be base and vicious as many on record have been appeared the lowest degradation a condition more abject than that of the blind mole or harmless worm for a long time i could not conceive how one man could go forth to murder his fellow or even why there were laws and governments but when i heard details of vice and bloodshed my wonder ceased and i turned away with disgust and loathing ,Frankenstein
every conversation of the cottagers now opened new wonders to me while i listened to the instructions which felix bestowed upon the arabian the strange system of human society was explained to me i heard of the division of property of immense wealth and squalid poverty of rank descent and noble blood ,Frankenstein
the words induced me to turn towards myself i learned that the possessions most esteemed by your fellow creatures were high and unsullied descent united with riches a man might be respected with only one of these advantages but without either he was considered except in very rare instances as a vagabond and a slave doomed to waste his powers for the profits of the chosen few and what was i of my creation and creator i was absolutely ignorant but i knew that i possessed no money no friends no kind of property i was besides endued with a figure hideously deformed and loathsome i was not even of the same nature as man i was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet i bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame my stature far exceeded theirs when i looked around i saw and heard of none like me was i then a monster a blot upon the earth from which all men fled and whom all men disowned ,Frankenstein
i cannot describe to you the agony that these reflections inflicted upon me i tried to dispel them but sorrow only increased with knowledge oh that i had for ever remained in my native wood nor known nor felt beyond the sensations of hunger thirst and heat ,Frankenstein
of what a strange nature is knowledge it clings to the mind when it has once seized on it like a lichen on the rock i wished sometimes to shake off all thought and feeling but i learned that there was but one means to overcome the sensation of pain and that was deatha state which i feared yet did not understand i admired virtue and good feelings and loved the gentle manners and amiable qualities of my cottagers but i was shut out from intercourse with them except through means which i obtained by stealth when i was unseen and unknown and which rather increased than satisfied the desire i had of becoming one among my fellows the gentle words of agatha and the animated smiles of the charming arabian were not for me the mild exhortations of the old man and the lively conversation of the loved felix were not for me miserable unhappy wretch ,Frankenstein
other lessons were impressed upon me even more deeply i heard of the difference of sexes and the birth and growth of children how the father doted on the smiles of the infant and the lively sallies of the older child how all the life and cares of the mother were wrapped up in the precious charge how the mind of youth expanded and gained knowledge of brother sister and all the various relationships which bind one human being to another in mutual bonds ,Frankenstein
but where were my friends and relations no father had watched my infant days no mother had blessed me with smiles and caresses or if they had all my past life was now a blot a blind vacancy in which i distinguished nothing from my earliest remembrance i had been as i then was in height and proportion i had never yet seen a being resembling me or who claimed any intercourse with me what was i the question again recurred to be answered only with groans ,Frankenstein
i will soon explain to what these feelings tended but allow me now to return to the cottagers whose story excited in me such various feelings of indignation delight and wonder but which all terminated in additional love and reverence for my protectors for so i loved in an innocent halfpainful selfdeceit to call them ,Frankenstein
some time elapsed before i learned the history of my friends it was one which could not fail to impress itself deeply on my mind unfolding as it did a number of circumstances each interesting and wonderful to one so utterly inexperienced as i was ,Frankenstein
the name of the old man was de lacey he was descended from a good family in france where he had lived for many years in affluence respected by his superiors and beloved by his equals his son was bred in the service of his country and agatha had ranked with ladies of the highest distinction a few months before my arrival they had lived in a large and luxurious city called paris surrounded by friends and possessed of every enjoyment which virtue refinement of intellect or taste accompanied by a moderate fortune could afford ,Frankenstein
the father of safie had been the cause of their ruin he was a turkish merchant and had inhabited paris for many years when for some reason which i could not learn he became obnoxious to the government he was seized and cast into prison the very day that safie arrived from constantinople to join him he was tried and condemned to death the injustice of his sentence was very flagrant all paris was indignant and it was judged that his religion and wealth rather than the crime alleged against him had been the cause of his condemnation ,Frankenstein
felix had accidentally been present at the trial his horror and indignation were uncontrollable when he heard the decision of the court he made at that moment a solemn vow to deliver him and then looked around for the means after many fruitless attempts to gain admittance to the prison he found a strongly grated window in an unguarded part of the building which lighted the dungeon of the unfortunate muhammadan who loaded with chains waited in despair the execution of the barbarous sentence felix visited the grate at night and made known to the prisoner his intentions in his favour the turk amazed and delighted endeavoured to kindle the zeal of his deliverer by promises of reward and wealth felix rejected his offers with contempt yet when he saw the lovely safie who was allowed to visit her father and who by her gestures expressed her lively gratitude the youth could not help owning to his own mind that the captive possessed a treasure which would fully reward his toil and hazard ,Frankenstein
the turk quickly perceived the impression that his daughter had made on the heart of felix and endeavoured to secure him more entirely in his interests by the promise of her hand in marriage so soon as he should be conveyed to a place of safety felix was too delicate to accept this offer yet he looked forward to the probability of the event as to the consummation of his happiness ,Frankenstein
during the ensuing days while the preparations were going forward for the escape of the merchant the zeal of felix was warmed by several letters that he received from this lovely girl who found means to express her thoughts in the language of her lover by the aid of an old man a servant of her father who understood french she thanked him in the most ardent terms for his intended services towards her parent and at the same time she gently deplored her own fate ,Frankenstein
i have copies of these letters for i found means during my residence in the hovel to procure the implements of writing and the letters were often in the hands of felix or agatha before i depart i will give them to you they will prove the truth of my tale but at present as the sun is already far declined i shall only have time to repeat the substance of them to you ,Frankenstein
safie related that her mother was a christian arab seized and made a slave by the turks recommended by her beauty she had won the heart of the father of safie who married her the young girl spoke in high and enthusiastic terms of her mother who born in freedom spurned the bondage to which she was now reduced she instructed her daughter in the tenets of her religion and taught her to aspire to higher powers of intellect and an independence of spirit forbidden to the female followers of muhammad this lady died but her lessons were indelibly impressed on the mind of safie who sickened at the prospect of again returning to asia and being immured within the walls of a harem allowed only to occupy herself with infantile amusements illsuited to the temper of her soul now accustomed to grand ideas and a noble emulation for virtue the prospect of marrying a christian and remaining in a country where women were allowed to take a rank in society was enchanting to her ,Frankenstein
the day for the execution of the turk was fixed but on the night previous to it he quitted his prison and before morning was distant many leagues from paris felix had procured passports in the name of his father sister and himself he had previously communicated his plan to the former who aided the deceit by quitting his house under the pretence of a journey and concealed himself with his daughter in an obscure part of paris ,Frankenstein
safie resolved to remain with her father until the moment of his departure before which time the turk renewed his promise that she should be united to his deliverer and felix remained with them in expectation of that event and in the meantime he enjoyed the society of the arabian who exhibited towards him the simplest and tenderest affection they conversed with one another through the means of an interpreter and sometimes with the interpretation of looks and safie sang to him the divine airs of her native country ,Frankenstein
the turk allowed this intimacy to take place and encouraged the hopes of the youthful lovers while in his heart he had formed far other plans he loathed the idea that his daughter should be united to a christian but he feared the resentment of felix if he should appear lukewarm for he knew that he was still in the power of his deliverer if he should choose to betray him to the italian state which they inhabited he revolved a thousand plans by which he should be enabled to prolong the deceit until it might be no longer necessary and secretly to take his daughter with him when he departed his plans were facilitated by the news which arrived from paris ,Frankenstein
the government of france were greatly enraged at the escape of their victim and spared no pains to detect and punish his deliverer the plot of felix was quickly discovered and de lacey and agatha were thrown into prison the news reached felix and roused him from his dream of pleasure his blind and aged father and his gentle sister lay in a noisome dungeon while he enjoyed the free air and the society of her whom he loved this idea was torture to him he quickly arranged with the turk that if the latter should find a favourable opportunity for escape before felix could return to italy safie should remain as a boarder at a convent at leghorn and then quitting the lovely arabian he hastened to paris and delivered himself up to the vengeance of the law hoping to free de lacey and agatha by this proceeding ,Frankenstein
they found a miserable asylum in the cottage in germany where i discovered them felix soon learned that the treacherous turk for whom he and his family endured such unheardof oppression on discovering that his deliverer was thus reduced to poverty and ruin became a traitor to good feeling and honour and had quitted italy with his daughter insultingly sending felix a pittance of money to aid him as he said in some plan of future maintenance ,Frankenstein
such were the events that preyed on the heart of felix and rendered him when i first saw him the most miserable of his family he could have endured poverty and while this distress had been the meed of his virtue he gloried in it but the ingratitude of the turk and the loss of his beloved safie were misfortunes more bitter and irreparable the arrival of the arabian now infused new life into his soul ,Frankenstein
when the news reached leghorn that felix was deprived of his wealth and rank the merchant commanded his daughter to think no more of her lover but to prepare to return to her native country the generous nature of safie was outraged by this command she attempted to expostulate with her father but he left her angrily reiterating his tyrannical mandate ,Frankenstein
a few days after the turk entered his daughters apartment and told her hastily that he had reason to believe that his residence at leghorn had been divulged and that he should speedily be delivered up to the french government he had consequently hired a vessel to convey him to constantinople for which city he should sail in a few hours he intended to leave his daughter under the care of a confidential servant to follow at her leisure with the greater part of his property which had not yet arrived at leghorn ,Frankenstein
when alone safie resolved in her own mind the plan of conduct that it would become her to pursue in this emergency a residence in turkey was abhorrent to her her religion and her feelings were alike averse to it by some papers of her father which fell into her hands she heard of the exile of her lover and learnt the name of the spot where he then resided she hesitated some time but at length she formed her determination taking with her some jewels that belonged to her and a sum of money she quitted italy with an attendant a native of leghorn but who understood the common language of turkey and departed for germany ,Frankenstein
she arrived in safety at a town about twenty leagues from the cottage of de lacey when her attendant fell dangerously ill safie nursed her with the most devoted affection but the poor girl died and the arabian was left alone unacquainted with the language of the country and utterly ignorant of the customs of the world she fell however into good hands the italian had mentioned the name of the spot for which they were bound and after her death the woman of the house in which they had lived took care that safie should arrive in safety at the cottage of her lover ,Frankenstein
as yet i looked upon crime as a distant evil benevolence and generosity were ever present before me inciting within me a desire to become an actor in the busy scene where so many admirable qualities were called forth and displayed but in giving an account of the progress of my intellect i must not omit a circumstance which occurred in the beginning of the month of august of the same year ,Frankenstein
one night during my accustomed visit to the neighbouring wood where i collected my own food and brought home firing for my protectors i found on the ground a leathern portmanteau containing several articles of dress and some books i eagerly seized the prize and returned with it to my hovel  fortunately the books were written in the language the elements of which i had acquired at the cottage they consisted of paradise lost a volume of plutarchs lives and the sorrows of werter the possession of these treasures gave me extreme delight i now continually studied and exercised my mind upon these histories whilst my friends were employed in their ordinary occupations ,Frankenstein
i can hardly describe to you the effect of these books they produced in me an infinity of new images and feelings that sometimes raised me to ecstasy but more frequently sunk me into the lowest dejection in the sorrows of werter besides the interest of its simple and affecting story so many opinions are canvassed and so many lights thrown upon what had hitherto been to me obscure subjects that i found in it a neverending source of speculation and astonishment the gentle and domestic manners it described combined with lofty sentiments and feelings which had for their object something out of self accorded well with my experience among my protectors and with the wants which were for ever alive in my own bosom but i thought werter himself a more divine being than i had ever beheld or imagined his character contained no pretension but it sank deep the disquisitions upon death and suicide were calculated to fill me with wonder i did not pretend to enter into the merits of the case yet i inclined towards the opinions of the hero whose extinction i wept without precisely understanding it ,Frankenstein
as i read however i applied much personally to my own feelings and condition i found myself similar yet at the same time strangely unlike to the beings concerning whom i read and to whose conversation i was a listener i sympathised with and partly understood them but i was unformed in mind i was dependent on none and related to none the path of my departure was free and there was none to lament my annihilation my person was hideous and my stature gigantic what did this mean who was i what was i whence did i come what was my destination these questions continually recurred but i was unable to solve them ,Frankenstein
the volume of plutarchs lives which i possessed contained the histories of the first founders of the ancient republics this book had a far different effect upon me from the sorrows of werter i learned from werters imaginations despondency and gloom but plutarch taught me high thoughts he elevated me above the wretched sphere of my own reflections to admire and love the heroes of past ages many things i read surpassed my understanding and experience i had a very confused knowledge of kingdoms wide extents of country mighty rivers and boundless seas but i was perfectly unacquainted with towns and large assemblages of men the cottage of my protectors had been the only school in which i had studied human nature but this book developed new and mightier scenes of action i read of men concerned in public affairs governing or massacring their species i felt the greatest ardour for virtue rise within me and abhorrence for vice as far as i understood the signification of those terms relative as they were as i applied them to pleasure and pain alone induced by these feelings i was of course led to admire peaceable lawgivers numa solon and lycurgus in preference to romulus and theseus the patriarchal lives of my protectors caused these impressions to take a firm hold on my mind perhaps if my first introduction to humanity had been made by a young soldier burning for glory and slaughter i should have been imbued with different sensations ,Frankenstein
but paradise lost excited different and far deeper emotions i read it as i had read the other volumes which had fallen into my hands as a true history it moved every feeling of wonder and awe that the picture of an omnipotent god warring with his creatures was capable of exciting i often referred the several situations as their similarity struck me to my own like adam i was apparently united by no link to any other being in existence but his state was far different from mine in every other respect he had come forth from the hands of god a perfect creature happy and prosperous guarded by the especial care of his creator he was allowed to converse with and acquire knowledge from beings of a superior nature but i was wretched helpless and alone many times i considered satan as the fitter emblem of my condition for often like him when i viewed the bliss of my protectors the bitter gall of envy rose within me ,Frankenstein
another circumstance strengthened and confirmed these feelings soon after my arrival in the hovel i discovered some papers in the pocket of the dress which i had taken from your laboratory at first i had neglected them but now that i was able to decipher the characters in which they were written i began to study them with diligence it was your journal of the four months that preceded my creation you minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress of your work this history was mingled with accounts of domestic occurrences you doubtless recollect these papers here they are everything is related in them which bears reference to my accursed origin the whole detail of that series of disgusting circumstances which produced it is set in view the minutest description of my odious and loathsome person is given in language which painted your own horrors and rendered mine indelible i sickened as i read hateful day when i received life i exclaimed in agony accursed creator why did you form a monster so hideous that even you turned from me in disgust god in pity made man beautiful and alluring after his own image but my form is a filthy type of yours more horrid even from the very resemblance satan had his companions fellow devils to admire and encourage him but i am solitary and abhorred ,Frankenstein
these were the reflections of my hours of despondency and solitude but when i contemplated the virtues of the cottagers their amiable and benevolent dispositions i persuaded myself that when they should become acquainted with my admiration of their virtues they would compassionate me and overlook my personal deformity could they turn from their door one however monstrous who solicited their compassion and friendship i resolved at least not to despair but in every way to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate i postponed this attempt for some months longer for the importance attached to its success inspired me with a dread lest i should fail besides i found that my understanding improved so much with every days experience that i was unwilling to commence this undertaking until a few more months should have added to my sagacity ,Frankenstein
several changes in the meantime took place in the cottage the presence of safie diffused happiness among its inhabitants and i also found that a greater degree of plenty reigned there felix and agatha spent more time in amusement and conversation and were assisted in their labours by servants they did not appear rich but they were contented and happy their feelings were serene and peaceful while mine became every day more tumultuous increase of knowledge only discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast i was i cherished hope it is true but it vanished when i beheld my person reflected in water or my shadow in the moonshine even as that frail image and that inconstant shade ,Frankenstein
i endeavoured to crush these fears and to fortify myself for the trial which in a few months i resolved to undergo and sometimes i allowed my thoughts unchecked by reason to ramble in the fields of paradise and dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my feelings and cheering my gloom their angelic countenances breathed smiles of consolation but it was all a dream no eve soothed my sorrows nor shared my thoughts i was alone i remembered adams supplication to his creator but where was mine he had abandoned me and in the bitterness of my heart i cursed him ,Frankenstein
autumn passed thus i saw with surprise and grief the leaves decay and fall and nature again assume the barren and bleak appearance it had worn when i first beheld the woods and the lovely moon yet i did not heed the bleakness of the weather i was better fitted by my conformation for the endurance of cold than heat but my chief delights were the sight of the flowers the birds and all the gay apparel of summer when those deserted me i turned with more attention towards the cottagers their happiness was not decreased by the absence of summer they loved and sympathised with one another and their joys depending on each other were not interrupted by the casualties that took place around them the more i saw of them the greater became my desire to claim their protection and kindness my heart yearned to be known and loved by these amiable creatures to see their sweet looks directed towards me with affection was the utmost limit of my ambition i dared not think that they would turn them from me with disdain and horror the poor that stopped at their door were never driven away i asked it is true for greater treasures than a little food or rest i required kindness and sympathy but i did not believe myself utterly unworthy of it ,Frankenstein
the winter advanced and an entire revolution of the seasons had taken place since i awoke into life my attention at this time was solely directed towards my plan of introducing myself into the cottage of my protectors i revolved many projects but that on which i finally fixed was to enter the dwelling when the blind old man should be alone i had sagacity enough to discover that the unnatural hideousness of my person was the chief object of horror with those who had formerly beheld me my voice although harsh had nothing terrible in it i thought therefore that if in the absence of his children i could gain the good will and mediation of the old de lacey i might by his means be tolerated by my younger protectors ,Frankenstein
one day when the sun shone on the red leaves that strewed the ground and diffused cheerfulness although it denied warmth safie agatha and felix departed on a long country walk and the old man at his own desire was left alone in the cottage when his children had departed he took up his guitar and played several mournful but sweet airs more sweet and mournful than i had ever heard him play before at first his countenance was illuminated with pleasure but as he continued thoughtfulness and sadness succeeded at length laying aside the instrument he sat absorbed in reflection ,Frankenstein
my heart beat quick this was the hour and moment of trial which would decide my hopes or realise my fears the servants were gone to a neighbouring fair all was silent in and around the cottage it was an excellent opportunity yet when i proceeded to execute my plan my limbs failed me and i sank to the ground again i rose and exerting all the firmness of which i was master removed the planks which i had placed before my hovel to conceal my retreat the fresh air revived me and with renewed determination i approached the door of their cottage ,Frankenstein
enter said de lacey and i will try in what manner i can to relieve your wants but unfortunately my children are from home and as i am blind i am afraid i shall find it difficult to procure food for you ,Frankenstein
no they are french but let us change the subject i am an unfortunate and deserted creature i look around and i have no relation or friend upon earth these amiable people to whom i go have never seen me and know little of me i am full of fears for if i fail there i am an outcast in the world for ever ,Frankenstein
do not despair to be friendless is indeed to be unfortunate but the hearts of men when unprejudiced by any obvious selfinterest are full of brotherly love and charity rely therefore on your hopes and if these friends are good and amiable do not despair ,Frankenstein
they are kindthey are the most excellent creatures in the world but unfortunately they are prejudiced against me i have good dispositions my life has been hitherto harmless and in some degree beneficial but a fatal prejudice clouds their eyes and where they ought to see a feeling and kind friend they behold only a detestable monster ,Frankenstein
i am about to undertake that task and it is on that account that i feel so many overwhelming terrors i tenderly love these friends i have unknown to them been for many months in the habits of daily kindness towards them but they believe that i wish to injure them and it is that prejudice which i wish to overcome ,Frankenstein
the old man paused and then continued if you will unreservedly confide to me the particulars of your tale i perhaps may be of use in undeceiving them i am blind and cannot judge of your countenance but there is something in your words which persuades me that you are sincere i am poor and an exile but it will afford me true pleasure to be in any way serviceable to a human creature ,Frankenstein
excellent man i thank you and accept your generous offer you raise me from the dust by this kindness and i trust that by your aid i shall not be driven from the society and sympathy of your fellow creatures ,Frankenstein
heaven forbid even if you were really criminal for that can only drive you to desperation and not instigate you to virtue i also am unfortunate i and my family have been condemned although innocent judge therefore if i do not feel for your misfortunes ,Frankenstein
how can i thank you my best and only benefactor from your lips first have i heard the voice of kindness directed towards me i shall be for ever grateful and your present humanity assures me of success with those friends whom i am on the point of meeting ,Frankenstein
i paused this i thought was the moment of decision which was to rob me of or bestow happiness on me for ever i struggled vainly for firmness sufficient to answer him but the effort destroyed all my remaining strength i sank on the chair and sobbed aloud at that moment i heard the steps of my younger protectors i had not a moment to lose but seizing the hand of the old man i cried now is the time save and protect me you and your family are the friends whom i seek do not you desert me in the hour of trial ,Frankenstein
at that instant the cottage door was opened and felix safie and agatha entered who can describe their horror and consternation on beholding me agatha fainted and safie unable to attend to her friend rushed out of the cottage felix darted forward and with supernatural force tore me from his father to whose knees i clung in a transport of fury he dashed me to the ground and struck me violently with a stick i could have torn him limb from limb as the lion rends the antelope but my heart sank within me as with bitter sickness and i refrained i saw him on the point of repeating his blow when overcome by pain and anguish i quitted the cottage and in the general tumult escaped unperceived to my hovel ,Frankenstein
cursed cursed creator why did i live why in that instant did i not extinguish the spark of existence which you had so wantonly bestowed i know not despair had not yet taken possession of me my feelings were those of rage and revenge i could with pleasure have destroyed the cottage and its inhabitants and have glutted myself with their shrieks and misery ,Frankenstein
when night came i quitted my retreat and wandered in the wood and now no longer restrained by the fear of discovery i gave vent to my anguish in fearful howlings i was like a wild beast that had broken the toils destroying the objects that obstructed me and ranging through the wood with a staglike swiftness oh what a miserable night i passed the cold stars shone in mockery and the bare trees waved their branches above me now and then the sweet voice of a bird burst forth amidst the universal stillness all save i were at rest or in enjoyment i like the archfiend bore a hell within me and finding myself unsympathised with wished to tear up the trees spread havoc and destruction around me and then to have sat down and enjoyed the ruin ,Frankenstein
but this was a luxury of sensation that could not endure i became fatigued with excess of bodily exertion and sank on the damp grass in the sick impotence of despair there was none among the myriads of men that existed who would pity or assist me and should i feel kindness towards my enemies no from that moment i declared everlasting war against the species and more than all against him who had formed me and sent me forth to this insupportable misery ,Frankenstein
the sun rose i heard the voices of men and knew that it was impossible to return to my retreat during that day accordingly i hid myself in some thick underwood determining to devote the ensuing hours to reflection on my situation ,Frankenstein
the pleasant sunshine and the pure air of day restored me to some degree of tranquillity and when i considered what had passed at the cottage i could not help believing that i had been too hasty in my conclusions i had certainly acted imprudently it was apparent that my conversation had interested the father in my behalf and i was a fool in having exposed my person to the horror of his children i ought to have familiarised the old de lacey to me and by degrees to have discovered myself to the rest of his family when they should have been prepared for my approach but i did not believe my errors to be irretrievable and after much consideration i resolved to return to the cottage seek the old man and by my representations win him to my party ,Frankenstein
these thoughts calmed me and in the afternoon i sank into a profound sleep but the fever of my blood did not allow me to be visited by peaceful dreams the horrible scene of the preceding day was for ever acting before my eyes the females were flying and the enraged felix tearing me from his fathers feet i awoke exhausted and finding that it was already night i crept forth from my hidingplace and went in search of food ,Frankenstein
when my hunger was appeased i directed my steps towards the wellknown path that conducted to the cottage all there was at peace i crept into my hovel and remained in silent expectation of the accustomed hour when the family arose that hour passed the sun mounted high in the heavens but the cottagers did not appear i trembled violently apprehending some dreadful misfortune the inside of the cottage was dark and i heard no motion i cannot describe the agony of this suspense ,Frankenstein
presently two countrymen passed by but pausing near the cottage they entered into conversation using violent gesticulations but i did not understand what they said as they spoke the language of the country which differed from that of my protectors soon after however felix approached with another man i was surprised as i knew that he had not quitted the cottage that morning and waited anxiously to discover from his discourse the meaning of these unusual appearances ,Frankenstein
do you consider said his companion to him that you will be obliged to pay three months rent and to lose the produce of your garden i do not wish to take any unfair advantage and i beg therefore that you will take some days to consider of your determination ,Frankenstein
it is utterly useless replied felix we can never again inhabit your cottage the life of my father is in the greatest danger owing to the dreadful circumstance that i have related my wife and my sister will never recover from their horror i entreat you not to reason with me any more take possession of your tenement and let me fly from this place ,Frankenstein
i continued for the remainder of the day in my hovel in a state of utter and stupid despair my protectors had departed and had broken the only link that held me to the world for the first time the feelings of revenge and hatred filled my bosom and i did not strive to control them but allowing myself to be borne away by the stream i bent my mind towards injury and death when i thought of my friends of the mild voice of de lacey the gentle eyes of agatha and the exquisite beauty of the arabian these thoughts vanished and a gush of tears somewhat soothed me but again when i reflected that they had spurned and deserted me anger returned a rage of anger and unable to injure anything human i turned my fury towards inanimate objects as night advanced i placed a variety of combustibles around the cottage and after having destroyed every vestige of cultivation in the garden i waited with forced impatience until the moon had sunk to commence my operations ,Frankenstein
as the night advanced a fierce wind arose from the woods and quickly dispersed the clouds that had loitered in the heavens the blast tore along like a mighty avalanche and produced a kind of insanity in my spirits that burst all bounds of reason and reflection i lighted the dry branch of a tree and danced with fury around the devoted cottage my eyes still fixed on the western horizon the edge of which the moon nearly touched a part of its orb was at length hid and i waved my brand it sank and with a loud scream i fired the straw and heath and bushes which i had collected the wind fanned the fire and the cottage was quickly enveloped by the flames which clung to it and licked it with their forked and destroying tongues ,Frankenstein
and now with the world before me whither should i bend my steps i resolved to fly far from the scene of my misfortunes but to me hated and despised every country must be equally horrible at length the thought of you crossed my mind i learned from your papers that you were my father my creator and to whom could i apply with more fitness than to him who had given me life among the lessons that felix had bestowed upon safie geography had not been omitted i had learned from these the relative situations of the different countries of the earth you had mentioned geneva as the name of your native town and towards this place i resolved to proceed ,Frankenstein
but how was i to direct myself i knew that i must travel in a southwesterly direction to reach my destination but the sun was my only guide i did not know the names of the towns that i was to pass through nor could i ask information from a single human being but i did not despair from you only could i hope for succour although towards you i felt no sentiment but that of hatred unfeeling heartless creator you had endowed me with perceptions and passions and then cast me abroad an object for the scorn and horror of mankind but on you only had i any claim for pity and redress and from you i determined to seek that justice which i vainly attempted to gain from any other being that wore the human form ,Frankenstein
my travels were long and the sufferings i endured intense it was late in autumn when i quitted the district where i had so long resided i travelled only at night fearful of encountering the visage of a human being nature decayed around me and the sun became heatless rain and snow poured around me mighty rivers were frozen the surface of the earth was hard and chill and bare and i found no shelter oh earth how often did i imprecate curses on the cause of my being the mildness of my nature had fled and all within me was turned to gall and bitterness the nearer i approached to your habitation the more deeply did i feel the spirit of revenge enkindled in my heart snow fell and the waters were hardened but i rested not a few incidents now and then directed me and i possessed a map of the country but i often wandered wide from my path the agony of my feelings allowed me no respite no incident occurred from which my rage and misery could not extract its food but a circumstance that happened when i arrived on the confines of switzerland when the sun had recovered its warmth and the earth again began to look green confirmed in an especial manner the bitterness and horror of my feelings ,Frankenstein
i generally rested during the day and travelled only when i was secured by night from the view of man one morning however finding that my path lay through a deep wood i ventured to continue my journey after the sun had risen the day which was one of the first of spring cheered even me by the loveliness of its sunshine and the balminess of the air i felt emotions of gentleness and pleasure that had long appeared dead revive within me half surprised by the novelty of these sensations i allowed myself to be borne away by them and forgetting my solitude and deformity dared to be happy soft tears again bedewed my cheeks and i even raised my humid eyes with thankfulness towards the blessed sun which bestowed such joy upon me ,Frankenstein
i continued to wind among the paths of the wood until i came to its boundary which was skirted by a deep and rapid river into which many of the trees bent their branches now budding with the fresh spring here i paused not exactly knowing what path to pursue when i heard the sound of voices that induced me to conceal myself under the shade of a cypress i was scarcely hid when a young girl came running towards the spot where i was concealed laughing as if she ran from someone in sport she continued her course along the precipitous sides of the river when suddenly her foot slipped and she fell into the rapid stream i rushed from my hidingplace and with extreme labour from the force of the current saved her and dragged her to shore she was senseless and i endeavoured by every means in my power to restore animation when i was suddenly interrupted by the approach of a rustic who was probably the person from whom she had playfully fled on seeing me he darted towards me and tearing the girl from my arms hastened towards the deeper parts of the wood i followed speedily i hardly knew why but when the man saw me draw near he aimed a gun which he carried at my body and fired i sank to the ground and my injurer with increased swiftness escaped into the wood ,Frankenstein
this was then the reward of my benevolence i had saved a human being from destruction and as a recompense i now writhed under the miserable pain of a wound which shattered the flesh and bone the feelings of kindness and gentleness which i had entertained but a few moments before gave place to hellish rage and gnashing of teeth inflamed by pain i vowed eternal hatred and vengeance to all mankind but the agony of my wound overcame me my pulses paused and i fainted ,Frankenstein
for some weeks i led a miserable life in the woods endeavouring to cure the wound which i had received the ball had entered my shoulder and i knew not whether it had remained there or passed through at any rate i had no means of extracting it my sufferings were augmented also by the oppressive sense of the injustice and ingratitude of their infliction my daily vows rose for revengea deep and deadly revenge such as would alone compensate for the outrages and anguish i had endured ,Frankenstein
after some weeks my wound healed and i continued my journey the labours i endured were no longer to be alleviated by the bright sun or gentle breezes of spring all joy was but a mockery which insulted my desolate state and made me feel more painfully that i was not made for the enjoyment of pleasure ,Frankenstein
it was evening when i arrived and i retired to a hidingplace among the fields that surround it to meditate in what manner i should apply to you i was oppressed by fatigue and hunger and far too unhappy to enjoy the gentle breezes of evening or the prospect of the sun setting behind the stupendous mountains of jura ,Frankenstein
at this time a slight sleep relieved me from the pain of reflection which was disturbed by the approach of a beautiful child who came running into the recess i had chosen with all the sportiveness of infancy suddenly as i gazed on him an idea seized me that this little creature was unprejudiced and had lived too short a time to have imbibed a horror of deformity if therefore i could seize him and educate him as my companion and friend i should not be so desolate in this peopled earth ,Frankenstein
urged by this impulse i seized on the boy as he passed and drew him towards me as soon as he beheld my form he placed his hands before his eyes and uttered a shrill scream i drew his hand forcibly from his face and said child what is the meaning of this i do not intend to hurt you listen to me ,Frankenstein
i gazed on my victim and my heart swelled with exultation and hellish triumph clapping my hands i exclaimed i too can create desolation my enemy is not invulnerable this death will carry despair to him and a thousand other miseries shall torment and destroy him ,Frankenstein
as i fixed my eyes on the child i saw something glittering on his breast i took it it was a portrait of a most lovely woman in spite of my malignity it softened and attracted me for a few moments i gazed with delight on her dark eyes fringed by deep lashes and her lovely lips but presently my rage returned i remembered that i was for ever deprived of the delights that such beautiful creatures could bestow and that she whose resemblance i contemplated would in regarding me have changed that air of divine benignity to one expressive of disgust and affright ,Frankenstein
can you wonder that such thoughts transported me with rage i only wonder that at that moment instead of venting my sensations in exclamations and agony i did not rush among mankind and perish in the attempt to destroy them ,Frankenstein
while i was overcome by these feelings i left the spot where i had committed the murder and seeking a more secluded hidingplace i entered a barn which had appeared to me to be empty a woman was sleeping on some straw she was young not indeed so beautiful as her whose portrait i held but of an agreeable aspect and blooming in the loveliness of youth and health here i thought is one of those whose joyimparting smiles are bestowed on all but me and then i bent over her and whispered awake fairest thy lover is nearhe who would give his life but to obtain one look of affection from thine eyes my beloved awake ,Frankenstein
the sleeper stirred a thrill of terror ran through me should she indeed awake and see me and curse me and denounce the murderer thus would she assuredly act if her darkened eyes opened and she beheld me the thought was madness it stirred the fiend within menot i but she shall suffer the murder i have committed because i am for ever robbed of all that she could give me she shall atone the crime had its source in her be hers the punishment thanks to the lessons of felix and the sanguinary laws of man i had learned now to work mischief i bent over her and placed the portrait securely in one of the folds of her dress she moved again and i fled ,Frankenstein
for some days i haunted the spot where these scenes had taken place sometimes wishing to see you sometimes resolved to quit the world and its miseries for ever at length i wandered towards these mountains and have ranged through their immense recesses consumed by a burning passion which you alone can gratify we may not part until you have promised to comply with my requisition i am alone and miserable man will not associate with me but one as deformed and horrible as myself would not deny herself to me my companion must be of the same species and have the same defects this being you must create ,Frankenstein
the being finished speaking and fixed his looks upon me in the expectation of a reply but i was bewildered perplexed and unable to arrange my ideas sufficiently to understand the full extent of his proposition he continued ,Frankenstein
you must create a female for me with whom i can live in the interchange of those sympathies necessary for my being this you alone can do and i demand it of you as a right which you must not refuse to concede ,Frankenstein
the latter part of his tale had kindled anew in me the anger that had died away while he narrated his peaceful life among the cottagers and as he said this i could no longer suppress the rage that burned within me ,Frankenstein
i do refuse it i replied and no torture shall ever extort a consent from me you may render me the most miserable of men but you shall never make me base in my own eyes shall i create another like yourself whose joint wickedness might desolate the world begone i have answered you you may torture me but i will never consent ,Frankenstein
you are in the wrong replied the fiend and instead of threatening i am content to reason with you i am malicious because i am miserable am i not shunned and hated by all mankind you my creator would tear me to pieces and triumph remember that and tell me why i should pity man more than he pities me you would not call it murder if you could precipitate me into one of those icerifts and destroy my frame the work of your own hands shall i respect man when he condemns me let him live with me in the interchange of kindness and instead of injury i would bestow every benefit upon him with tears of gratitude at his acceptance but that cannot be the human senses are insurmountable barriers to our union yet mine shall not be the submission of abject slavery i will revenge my injuries if i cannot inspire love i will cause fear and chiefly towards you my archenemy because my creator do i swear inextinguishable hatred have a care i will work at your destruction nor finish until i desolate your heart so that you shall curse the hour of your birth ,Frankenstein
i intended to reason this passion is detrimental to me for you do not reflect that you are the cause of its excess if any being felt emotions of benevolence towards me i should return them a hundred and a hundredfold for that one creatures sake i would make peace with the whole kind but i now indulge in dreams of bliss that cannot be realised what i ask of you is reasonable and moderate i demand a creature of another sex but as hideous as myself the gratification is small but it is all that i can receive and it shall content me it is true we shall be monsters cut off from all the world but on that account we shall be more attached to one another our lives will not be happy but they will be harmless and free from the misery i now feel oh my creator make me happy let me feel gratitude towards you for one benefit let me see that i excite the sympathy of some existing thing do not deny me my request ,Frankenstein
i was moved i shuddered when i thought of the possible consequences of my consent but i felt that there was some justice in his argument his tale and the feelings he now expressed proved him to be a creature of fine sensations and did i not as his maker owe him all the portion of happiness that it was in my power to bestow he saw my change of feeling and continued ,Frankenstein
if you consent neither you nor any other human being shall ever see us again i will go to the vast wilds of south america my food is not that of man i do not destroy the lamb and the kid to glut my appetite acorns and berries afford me sufficient nourishment my companion will be of the same nature as myself and will be content with the same fare we shall make our bed of dried leaves the sun will shine on us as on man and will ripen our food the picture i present to you is peaceful and human and you must feel that you could deny it only in the wantonness of power and cruelty pitiless as you have been towards me i now see compassion in your eyes let me seize the favourable moment and persuade you to promise what i so ardently desire ,Frankenstein
you propose replied i to fly from the habitations of man to dwell in those wilds where the beasts of the field will be your only companions how can you who long for the love and sympathy of man persevere in this exile you will return and again seek their kindness and you will meet with their detestation your evil passions will be renewed and you will then have a companion to aid you in the task of destruction this may not be cease to argue the point for i cannot consent ,Frankenstein
how inconstant are your feelings but a moment ago you were moved by my representations and why do you again harden yourself to my complaints i swear to you by the earth which i inhabit and by you that made me that with the companion you bestow i will quit the neighbourhood of man and dwell as it may chance in the most savage of places my evil passions will have fled for i shall meet with sympathy my life will flow quietly away and in my dying moments i shall not curse my maker ,Frankenstein
his words had a strange effect upon me i compassionated him and sometimes felt a wish to console him but when i looked upon him when i saw the filthy mass that moved and talked my heart sickened and my feelings were altered to those of horror and hatred i tried to stifle these sensations i thought that as i could not sympathise with him i had no right to withhold from him the small portion of happiness which was yet in my power to bestow ,Frankenstein
you swear i said to be harmless but have you not already shown a degree of malice that should reasonably make me distrust you may not even this be a feint that will increase your triumph by affording a wider scope for your revenge ,Frankenstein
how is this i must not be trifled with and i demand an answer if i have no ties and no affections hatred and vice must be my portion the love of another will destroy the cause of my crimes and i shall become a thing of whose existence everyone will be ignorant my vices are the children of a forced solitude that i abhor and my virtues will necessarily arise when i live in communion with an equal i shall feel the affections of a sensitive being and become linked to the chain of existence and events from which i am now excluded ,Frankenstein
i paused some time to reflect on all he had related and the various arguments which he had employed i thought of the promise of virtues which he had displayed on the opening of his existence and the subsequent blight of all kindly feeling by the loathing and scorn which his protectors had manifested towards him his power and threats were not omitted in my calculations a creature who could exist in the icecaves of the glaciers and hide himself from pursuit among the ridges of inaccessible precipices was a being possessing faculties it would be vain to cope with after a long pause of reflection i concluded that the justice due both to him and my fellow creatures demanded of me that i should comply with his request turning to him therefore i said ,Frankenstein
i swear he cried by the sun and by the blue sky of heaven and by the fire of love that burns my heart that if you grant my prayer while they exist you shall never behold me again depart to your home and commence your labours i shall watch their progress with unutterable anxiety and fear not but that when you are ready i shall appear ,Frankenstein
saying this he suddenly quitted me fearful perhaps of any change in my sentiments i saw him descend the mountain with greater speed than the flight of an eagle and quickly lost among the undulations of the sea of ice ,Frankenstein
his tale had occupied the whole day and the sun was upon the verge of the horizon when he departed i knew that i ought to hasten my descent towards the valley as i should soon be encompassed in darkness but my heart was heavy and my steps slow the labour of winding among the little paths of the mountain and fixing my feet firmly as i advanced perplexed me occupied as i was by the emotions which the occurrences of the day had produced night was far advanced when i came to the halfway restingplace and seated myself beside the fountain the stars shone at intervals as the clouds passed from over them the dark pines rose before me and every here and there a broken tree lay on the ground it was a scene of wonderful solemnity and stirred strange thoughts within me i wept bitterly and clasping my hands in agony i exclaimed oh stars and clouds and winds ye are all about to mock me if ye really pity me crush sensation and memory let me become as nought but if not depart depart and leave me in darkness ,Frankenstein
these were wild and miserable thoughts but i cannot describe to you how the eternal twinkling of the stars weighed upon me and how i listened to every blast of wind as if it were a dull ugly siroc on its way to consume me ,Frankenstein
morning dawned before i arrived at the village of chamounix i took no rest but returned immediately to geneva even in my own heart i could give no expression to my sensationsthey weighed on me with a mountains weight and their excess destroyed my agony beneath them thus i returned home and entering the house presented myself to the family my haggard and wild appearance awoke intense alarm but i answered no question scarcely did i speak i felt as if i were placed under a banas if i had no right to claim their sympathiesas if never more might i enjoy companionship with them yet even thus i loved them to adoration and to save them i resolved to dedicate myself to my most abhorred task the prospect of such an occupation made every other circumstance of existence pass before me like a dream and that thought only had to me the reality of life ,Frankenstein
day after day week after week passed away on my return to geneva and i could not collect the courage to recommence my work i feared the vengeance of the disappointed fiend yet i was unable to overcome my repugnance to the task which was enjoined me i found that i could not compose a female without again devoting several months to profound study and laborious disquisition i had heard of some discoveries having been made by an english philosopher the knowledge of which was material to my success and i sometimes thought of obtaining my fathers consent to visit england for this purpose but i clung to every pretence of delay and shrank from taking the first step in an undertaking whose immediate necessity began to appear less absolute to me a change indeed had taken place in me my health which had hitherto declined was now much restored and my spirits when unchecked by the memory of my unhappy promise rose proportionably my father saw this change with pleasure and he turned his thoughts towards the best method of eradicating the remains of my melancholy which every now and then would return by fits and with a devouring blackness overcast the approaching sunshine at these moments i took refuge in the most perfect solitude i passed whole days on the lake alone in a little boat watching the clouds and listening to the rippling of the waves silent and listless but the fresh air and bright sun seldom failed to restore me to some degree of composure and on my return i met the salutations of my friends with a readier smile and a more cheerful heart ,Frankenstein
i am happy to remark my dear son that you have resumed your former pleasures and seem to be returning to yourself and yet you are still unhappy and still avoid our society for some time i was lost in conjecture as to the cause of this but yesterday an idea struck me and if it is well founded i conjure you to avow it reserve on such a point would be not only useless but draw down treble misery on us all ,Frankenstein
i confess my son that i have always looked forward to your marriage with our dear elizabeth as the tie of our domestic comfort and the stay of my declining years you were attached to each other from your earliest infancy you studied together and appeared in dispositions and tastes entirely suited to one another but so blind is the experience of man that what i conceived to be the best assistants to my plan may have entirely destroyed it you perhaps regard her as your sister without any wish that she might become your wife nay you may have met with another whom you may love and considering yourself as bound in honour to elizabeth this struggle may occasion the poignant misery which you appear to feel ,Frankenstein
my dear father reassure yourself i love my cousin tenderly and sincerely i never saw any woman who excited as elizabeth does my warmest admiration and affection my future hopes and prospects are entirely bound up in the expectation of our union ,Frankenstein
the expression of your sentiments of this subject my dear victor gives me more pleasure than i have for some time experienced if you feel thus we shall assuredly be happy however present events may cast a gloom over us but it is this gloom which appears to have taken so strong a hold of your mind that i wish to dissipate tell me therefore whether you object to an immediate solemnisation of the marriage we have been unfortunate and recent events have drawn us from that everyday tranquillity befitting my years and infirmities you are younger yet i do not suppose possessed as you are of a competent fortune that an early marriage would at all interfere with any future plans of honour and utility that you may have formed do not suppose however that i wish to dictate happiness to you or that a delay on your part would cause me any serious uneasiness interpret my words with candour and answer me i conjure you with confidence and sincerity ,Frankenstein
i listened to my father in silence and remained for some time incapable of offering any reply i revolved rapidly in my mind a multitude of thoughts and endeavoured to arrive at some conclusion alas to me the idea of an immediate union with my elizabeth was one of horror and dismay i was bound by a solemn promise which i had not yet fulfilled and dared not break or if i did what manifold miseries might not impend over me and my devoted family could i enter into a festival with this deadly weight yet hanging round my neck and bowing me to the ground i must perform my engagement and let the monster depart with his mate before i allowed myself to enjoy the delight of a union from which i expected peace ,Frankenstein
i remembered also the necessity imposed upon me of either journeying to england or entering into a long correspondence with those philosophers of that country whose knowledge and discoveries were of indispensable use to me in my present undertaking the latter method of obtaining the desired intelligence was dilatory and unsatisfactory besides i had an insurmountable aversion to the idea of engaging myself in my loathsome task in my fathers house while in habits of familiar intercourse with those i loved i knew that a thousand fearful accidents might occur the slightest of which would disclose a tale to thrill all connected with me with horror i was aware also that i should often lose all selfcommand all capacity of hiding the harrowing sensations that would possess me during the progress of my unearthly occupation i must absent myself from all i loved while thus employed once commenced it would quickly be achieved and i might be restored to my family in peace and happiness my promise fulfilled the monster would depart for ever or so my fond fancy imaged some accident might meanwhile occur to destroy him and put an end to my slavery for ever ,Frankenstein
these feelings dictated my answer to my father i expressed a wish to visit england but concealing the true reasons of this request i clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion while i urged my desire with an earnestness that easily induced my father to comply after so long a period of an absorbing melancholy that resembled madness in its intensity and effects he was glad to find that i was capable of taking pleasure in the idea of such a journey and he hoped that change of scene and varied amusement would before my return have restored me entirely to myself ,Frankenstein
the duration of my absence was left to my own choice a few months or at most a year was the period contemplated one paternal kind precaution he had taken to ensure my having a companion without previously communicating with me he had in concert with elizabeth arranged that clerval should join me at strasburgh this interfered with the solitude i coveted for the prosecution of my task yet at the commencement of my journey the presence of my friend could in no way be an impediment and truly i rejoiced that thus i should be saved many hours of lonely maddening reflection nay henry might stand between me and the intrusion of my foe if i were alone would he not at times force his abhorred presence on me to remind me of my task or to contemplate its progress ,Frankenstein
to england therefore i was bound and it was understood that my union with elizabeth should take place immediately on my return my fathers age rendered him extremely averse to delay for myself there was one reward i promised myself from my detested toilsone consolation for my unparalleled sufferings it was the prospect of that day when enfranchised from my miserable slavery i might claim elizabeth and forget the past in my union with her ,Frankenstein
i now made arrangements for my journey but one feeling haunted me which filled me with fear and agitation during my absence i should leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and unprotected from his attacks exasperated as he might be by my departure but he had promised to follow me wherever i might go and would he not accompany me to england this imagination was dreadful in itself but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends i was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of this might happen but through the whole period during which i was the slave of my creature i allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of the moment and my present sensations strongly intimated that the fiend would follow me and exempt my family from the danger of his machinations ,Frankenstein
it was in the latter end of september that i again quitted my native country my journey had been my own suggestion and elizabeth therefore acquiesced but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of my suffering away from her the inroads of misery and grief it had been her care which provided me a companion in clervaland yet a man is blind to a thousand minute circumstances which call forth a womans sedulous attention she longed to bid me hasten my return a thousand conflicting emotions rendered her mute as she bade me a tearful silent farewell ,Frankenstein
i threw myself into the carriage that was to convey me away hardly knowing whither i was going and careless of what was passing around i remembered only and it was with a bitter anguish that i reflected on it to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with me filled with dreary imaginations i passed through many beautiful and majestic scenes but my eyes were fixed and unobserving i could only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy me whilst they endured ,Frankenstein
after some days spent in listless indolence during which i traversed many leagues i arrived at strasburgh where i waited two days for clerval he came alas how great was the contrast between us he was alive to every new scene joyful when he saw the beauties of the setting sun and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new day he pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and the appearances of the sky this is what it is to live he cried now i enjoy existence but you my dear frankenstein wherefore are you desponding and sorrowful in truth i was occupied by gloomy thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden sunrise reflected in the rhine and you my friend would be far more amused with the journal of clerval who observed the scenery with an eye of feeling and delight than in listening to my reflections i a miserable wretch haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to enjoyment ,Frankenstein
we had agreed to descend the rhine in a boat from strasburgh to rotterdam whence we might take shipping for london during this voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns we stayed a day at mannheim and on the fifth from our departure from strasburgh arrived at mainz the course of the rhine below mainz becomes much more picturesque the river descends rapidly and winds between hills not high but steep and of beautiful forms we saw many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices surrounded by black woods high and inaccessible this part of the rhine indeed presents a singularly variegated landscape in one spot you view rugged hills ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices with the dark rhine rushing beneath and on the sudden turn of a promontory flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river and populous towns occupy the scene ,Frankenstein
we travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers as we glided down the stream even i depressed in mind and my spirits continually agitated by gloomy feelings even i was pleased i lay at the bottom of the boat and as i gazed on the cloudless blue sky i seemed to drink in a tranquillity to which i had long been a stranger and if these were my sensations who can describe those of henry he felt as if he had been transported to fairyland and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by man i have seen he said the most beautiful scenes of my own country i have visited the lakes of lucerne and uri where the snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water casting black and impenetrable shades which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay appearance i have seen this lake agitated by a tempest when the wind tore up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the waterspout must be on the great ocean and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the nightly wind i have seen the mountains of la valais and the pays de vaud but this country victor pleases me more than all those wonders the mountains of switzerland are more majestic and strange but there is a charm in the banks of this divine river that i never before saw equalled look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice and that also on the island almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees and now that group of labourers coming from among their vines and that village half hid in the recess of the mountain oh surely the spirit that inhabits and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who pile the glacier or retire to the inaccessible peaks of the mountains of our own country ,Frankenstein
clerval beloved friend even now it delights me to record your words and to dwell on the praise of which you are so eminently deserving he was a being formed in the very poetry of nature his wild and enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart his soul overflowed with ardent affections and his friendship was of that devoted and wondrous nature that the worldlyminded teach us to look for only in the imagination but even human sympathies were not sufficient to satisfy his eager mind the scenery of external nature which others regard only with admiration he loved with ardour ,Frankenstein
the sounding cataract haunted him like a passion the tall rock the mountain and the deep and gloomy wood their colours and their forms were then to him an appetite a feeling and a love that had no need of a remoter charm by thought supplied or any interest unborrowd from the eye ,Frankenstein
and where does he now exist is this gentle and lovely being lost for ever has this mind so replete with ideas imaginations fanciful and magnificent which formed a world whose existence depended on the life of its creatorhas this mind perished does it now only exist in my memory no it is not thus your form so divinely wrought and beaming with beauty has decayed but your spirit still visits and consoles your unhappy friend ,Frankenstein
pardon this gush of sorrow these ineffectual words are but a slight tribute to the unexampled worth of henry but they soothe my heart overflowing with the anguish which his remembrance creates i will proceed with my tale ,Frankenstein
our journey here lost the interest arising from beautiful scenery but we arrived in a few days at rotterdam whence we proceeded by sea to england it was on a clear morning in the latter days of december that i first saw the white cliffs of britain the banks of the thames presented a new scene they were flat but fertile and almost every town was marked by the remembrance of some story we saw tilbury fort and remembered the spanish armada gravesend woolwich and greenwichplaces which i had heard of even in my country ,Frankenstein
london was our present point of rest we determined to remain several months in this wonderful and celebrated city clerval desired the intercourse of the men of genius and talent who flourished at this time but this was with me a secondary object i was principally occupied with the means of obtaining the information necessary for the completion of my promise and quickly availed myself of the letters of introduction that i had brought with me addressed to the most distinguished natural philosophers ,Frankenstein
if this journey had taken place during my days of study and happiness it would have afforded me inexpressible pleasure but a blight had come over my existence and i only visited these people for the sake of the information they might give me on the subject in which my interest was so terribly profound company was irksome to me when alone i could fill my mind with the sights of heaven and earth the voice of henry soothed me and i could thus cheat myself into a transitory peace but busy uninteresting joyous faces brought back despair to my heart i saw an insurmountable barrier placed between me and my fellow men this barrier was sealed with the blood of william and justine and to reflect on the events connected with those names filled my soul with anguish ,Frankenstein
but in clerval i saw the image of my former self he was inquisitive and anxious to gain experience and instruction the difference of manners which he observed was to him an inexhaustible source of instruction and amusement he was also pursuing an object he had long had in view his design was to visit india in the belief that he had in his knowledge of its various languages and in the views he had taken of its society the means of materially assisting the progress of european colonization and trade in britain only could he further the execution of his plan he was for ever busy and the only check to his enjoyments was my sorrowful and dejected mind i tried to conceal this as much as possible that i might not debar him from the pleasures natural to one who was entering on a new scene of life undisturbed by any care or bitter recollection i often refused to accompany him alleging another engagement that i might remain alone i now also began to collect the materials necessary for my new creation and this was to me like the torture of single drops of water continually falling on the head every thought that was devoted to it was an extreme anguish and every word that i spoke in allusion to it caused my lips to quiver and my heart to palpitate ,Frankenstein
after passing some months in london we received a letter from a person in scotland who had formerly been our visitor at geneva he mentioned the beauties of his native country and asked us if those were not sufficient allurements to induce us to prolong our journey as far north as perth where he resided clerval eagerly desired to accept this invitation and i although i abhorred society wished to view again mountains and streams and all the wondrous works with which nature adorns her chosen dwellingplaces ,Frankenstein
we had arrived in england at the beginning of october and it was now february we accordingly determined to commence our journey towards the north at the expiration of another month in this expedition we did not intend to follow the great road to edinburgh but to visit windsor oxford matlock and the cumberland lakes resolving to arrive at the completion of this tour about the end of july i packed up my chemical instruments and the materials i had collected resolving to finish my labours in some obscure nook in the northern highlands of scotland ,Frankenstein
we quitted london on the th of march and remained a few days at windsor rambling in its beautiful forest this was a new scene to us mountaineers the majestic oaks the quantity of game and the herds of stately deer were all novelties to us ,Frankenstein
from thence we proceeded to oxford as we entered this city our minds were filled with the remembrance of the events that had been transacted there more than a century and a half before it was here that charles i had collected his forces this city had remained faithful to him after the whole nation had forsaken his cause to join the standard of parliament and liberty the memory of that unfortunate king and his companions the amiable falkland the insolent goring his queen and son gave a peculiar interest to every part of the city which they might be supposed to have inhabited the spirit of elder days found a dwelling here and we delighted to trace its footsteps if these feelings had not found an imaginary gratification the appearance of the city had yet in itself sufficient beauty to obtain our admiration the colleges are ancient and picturesque the streets are almost magnificent and the lovely isis which flows beside it through meadows of exquisite verdure is spread forth into a placid expanse of waters which reflects its majestic assemblage of towers and spires and domes embosomed among aged trees ,Frankenstein
i enjoyed this scene and yet my enjoyment was embittered both by the memory of the past and the anticipation of the future i was formed for peaceful happiness during my youthful days discontent never visited my mind and if i was ever overcome by ennui the sight of what is beautiful in nature or the study of what is excellent and sublime in the productions of man could always interest my heart and communicate elasticity to my spirits but i am a blasted tree the bolt has entered my soul and i felt then that i should survive to exhibit what i shall soon cease to bea miserable spectacle of wrecked humanity pitiable to others and intolerable to myself ,Frankenstein
we passed a considerable period at oxford rambling among its environs and endeavouring to identify every spot which might relate to the most animating epoch of english history our little voyages of discovery were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented themselves we visited the tomb of the illustrious hampden and the field on which that patriot fell for a moment my soul was elevated from its debasing and miserable fears to contemplate the divine ideas of liberty and selfsacrifice of which these sights were the monuments and the remembrancers for an instant i dared to shake off my chains and look around me with a free and lofty spirit but the iron had eaten into my flesh and i sank again trembling and hopeless into my miserable self ,Frankenstein
we left oxford with regret and proceeded to matlock which was our next place of rest the country in the neighbourhood of this village resembled to a greater degree the scenery of switzerland but everything is on a lower scale and the green hills want the crown of distant white alps which always attend on the piny mountains of my native country we visited the wondrous cave and the little cabinets of natural history where the curiosities are disposed in the same manner as in the collections at servox and chamounix the latter name made me tremble when pronounced by henry and i hastened to quit matlock with which that terrible scene was thus associated ,Frankenstein
from derby still journeying northwards we passed two months in cumberland and westmorland i could now almost fancy myself among the swiss mountains the little patches of snow which yet lingered on the northern sides of the mountains the lakes and the dashing of the rocky streams were all familiar and dear sights to me here also we made some acquaintances who almost contrived to cheat me into happiness the delight of clerval was proportionably greater than mine his mind expanded in the company of men of talent and he found in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his inferiors i could pass my life here said he to me and among these mountains i should scarcely regret switzerland and the rhine ,Frankenstein
but he found that a travellers life is one that includes much pain amidst its enjoyments his feelings are for ever on the stretch and when he begins to sink into repose he finds himself obliged to quit that on which he rests in pleasure for something new which again engages his attention and which also he forsakes for other novelties ,Frankenstein
we had scarcely visited the various lakes of cumberland and westmorland and conceived an affection for some of the inhabitants when the period of our appointment with our scotch friend approached and we left them to travel on for my own part i was not sorry i had now neglected my promise for some time and i feared the effects of the dmons disappointment he might remain in switzerland and wreak his vengeance on my relatives this idea pursued me and tormented me at every moment from which i might otherwise have snatched repose and peace i waited for my letters with feverish impatience if they were delayed i was miserable and overcome by a thousand fears and when they arrived and i saw the superscription of elizabeth or my father i hardly dared to read and ascertain my fate sometimes i thought that the fiend followed me and might expedite my remissness by murdering my companion when these thoughts possessed me i would not quit henry for a moment but followed him as his shadow to protect him from the fancied rage of his destroyer i felt as if i had committed some great crime the consciousness of which haunted me i was guiltless but i had indeed drawn down a horrible curse upon my head as mortal as that of crime ,Frankenstein
i visited edinburgh with languid eyes and mind and yet that city might have interested the most unfortunate being clerval did not like it so well as oxford for the antiquity of the latter city was more pleasing to him but the beauty and regularity of the new town of edinburgh its romantic castle and its environs the most delightful in the world arthurs seat st bernards well and the pentland hills compensated him for the change and filled him with cheerfulness and admiration but i was impatient to arrive at the termination of my journey ,Frankenstein
we left edinburgh in a week passing through coupar st andrews and along the banks of the tay to perth where our friend expected us but i was in no mood to laugh and talk with strangers or enter into their feelings or plans with the good humour expected from a guest and accordingly i told clerval that i wished to make the tour of scotland alone do you said i enjoy yourself and let this be our rendezvous i may be absent a month or two but do not interfere with my motions i entreat you leave me to peace and solitude for a short time and when i return i hope it will be with a lighter heart more congenial to your own temper ,Frankenstein
henry wished to dissuade me but seeing me bent on this plan ceased to remonstrate he entreated me to write often i had rather be with you he said in your solitary rambles than with these scotch people whom i do not know hasten then my dear friend to return that i may again feel myself somewhat at home which i cannot do in your absence ,Frankenstein
having parted from my friend i determined to visit some remote spot of scotland and finish my work in solitude i did not doubt but that the monster followed me and would discover himself to me when i should have finished that he might receive his companion ,Frankenstein
with this resolution i traversed the northern highlands and fixed on one of the remotest of the orkneys as the scene of my labours it was a place fitted for such a work being hardly more than a rock whose high sides were continually beaten upon by the waves the soil was barren scarcely affording pasture for a few miserable cows and oatmeal for its inhabitants which consisted of five persons whose gaunt and scraggy limbs gave tokens of their miserable fare vegetables and bread when they indulged in such luxuries and even fresh water was to be procured from the mainland which was about five miles distant ,Frankenstein
on the whole island there were but three miserable huts and one of these was vacant when i arrived this i hired it contained but two rooms and these exhibited all the squalidness of the most miserable penury the thatch had fallen in the walls were unplastered and the door was off its hinges i ordered it to be repaired bought some furniture and took possession an incident which would doubtless have occasioned some surprise had not all the senses of the cottagers been benumbed by want and squalid poverty as it was i lived ungazed at and unmolested hardly thanked for the pittance of food and clothes which i gave so much does suffering blunt even the coarsest sensations of men ,Frankenstein
in this retreat i devoted the morning to labour but in the evening when the weather permitted i walked on the stony beach of the sea to listen to the waves as they roared and dashed at my feet it was a monotonous yet everchanging scene i thought of switzerland it was far different from this desolate and appalling landscape its hills are covered with vines and its cottages are scattered thickly in the plains its fair lakes reflect a blue and gentle sky and when troubled by the winds their tumult is but as the play of a lively infant when compared to the roarings of the giant ocean ,Frankenstein
in this manner i distributed my occupations when i first arrived but as i proceeded in my labour it became every day more horrible and irksome to me sometimes i could not prevail on myself to enter my laboratory for several days and at other times i toiled day and night in order to complete my work it was indeed a filthy process in which i was engaged during my first experiment a kind of enthusiastic frenzy had blinded me to the horror of my employment my mind was intently fixed on the consummation of my labour and my eyes were shut to the horror of my proceedings but now i went to it in cold blood and my heart often sickened at the work of my hands ,Frankenstein
thus situated employed in the most detestable occupation immersed in a solitude where nothing could for an instant call my attention from the actual scene in which i was engaged my spirits became unequal i grew restless and nervous every moment i feared to meet my persecutor sometimes i sat with my eyes fixed on the ground fearing to raise them lest they should encounter the object which i so much dreaded to behold i feared to wander from the sight of my fellow creatures lest when alone he should come to claim his companion ,Frankenstein
in the mean time i worked on and my labour was already considerably advanced i looked towards its completion with a tremulous and eager hope which i dared not trust myself to question but which was intermixed with obscure forebodings of evil that made my heart sicken in my bosom ,Frankenstein
i sat one evening in my laboratory the sun had set and the moon was just rising from the sea i had not sufficient light for my employment and i remained idle in a pause of consideration of whether i should leave my labour for the night or hasten its conclusion by an unremitting attention to it as i sat a train of reflection occurred to me which led me to consider the effects of what i was now doing three years before i was engaged in the same manner and had created a fiend whose unparalleled barbarity had desolated my heart and filled it for ever with the bitterest remorse i was now about to form another being of whose dispositions i was alike ignorant she might become ten thousand times more malignant than her mate and delight for its own sake in murder and wretchedness he had sworn to quit the neighbourhood of man and hide himself in deserts but she had not and she who in all probability was to become a thinking and reasoning animal might refuse to comply with a compact made before her creation they might even hate each other the creature who already lived loathed his own deformity and might he not conceive a greater abhorrence for it when it came before his eyes in the female form she also might turn with disgust from him to the superior beauty of man she might quit him and he be again alone exasperated by the fresh provocation of being deserted by one of his own species ,Frankenstein
even if they were to leave europe and inhabit the deserts of the new world yet one of the first results of those sympathies for which the dmon thirsted would be children and a race of devils would be propagated upon the earth who might make the very existence of the species of man a condition precarious and full of terror had i right for my own benefit to inflict this curse upon everlasting generations i had before been moved by the sophisms of the being i had created i had been struck senseless by his fiendish threats but now for the first time the wickedness of my promise burst upon me i shuddered to think that future ages might curse me as their pest whose selfishness had not hesitated to buy its own peace at the price perhaps of the existence of the whole human race ,Frankenstein
i trembled and my heart failed within me when on looking up i saw by the light of the moon the dmon at the casement a ghastly grin wrinkled his lips as he gazed on me where i sat fulfilling the task which he had allotted to me yes he had followed me in my travels he had loitered in forests hid himself in caves or taken refuge in wide and desert heaths and he now came to mark my progress and claim the fulfilment of my promise ,Frankenstein
as i looked on him his countenance expressed the utmost extent of malice and treachery i thought with a sensation of madness on my promise of creating another like to him and trembling with passion tore to pieces the thing on which i was engaged the wretch saw me destroy the creature on whose future existence he depended for happiness and with a howl of devilish despair and revenge withdrew ,Frankenstein
i left the room and locking the door made a solemn vow in my own heart never to resume my labours and then with trembling steps i sought my own apartment i was alone none were near me to dissipate the gloom and relieve me from the sickening oppression of the most terrible reveries ,Frankenstein
several hours passed and i remained near my window gazing on the sea it was almost motionless for the winds were hushed and all nature reposed under the eye of the quiet moon a few fishing vessels alone specked the water and now and then the gentle breeze wafted the sound of voices as the fishermen called to one another i felt the silence although i was hardly conscious of its extreme profundity until my ear was suddenly arrested by the paddling of oars near the shore and a person landed close to my house ,Frankenstein
in a few minutes after i heard the creaking of my door as if some one endeavoured to open it softly i trembled from head to foot i felt a presentiment of who it was and wished to rouse one of the peasants who dwelt in a cottage not far from mine but i was overcome by the sensation of helplessness so often felt in frightful dreams when you in vain endeavour to fly from an impending danger and was rooted to the spot ,Frankenstein
you have destroyed the work which you began what is it that you intend do you dare to break your promise i have endured toil and misery i left switzerland with you i crept along the shores of the rhine among its willow islands and over the summits of its hills i have dwelt many months in the heaths of england and among the deserts of scotland i have endured incalculable fatigue and cold and hunger do you dare destroy my hopes ,Frankenstein
slave i before reasoned with you but you have proved yourself unworthy of my condescension remember that i have power you believe yourself miserable but i can make you so wretched that the light of day will be hateful to you you are my creator but i am your master obey ,Frankenstein
the hour of my irresolution is past and the period of your power is arrived your threats cannot move me to do an act of wickedness but they confirm me in a determination of not creating you a companion in vice shall i in cool blood set loose upon the earth a dmon whose delight is in death and wretchedness begone i am firm and your words will only exasperate my rage ,Frankenstein
the monster saw my determination in my face and gnashed his teeth in the impotence of anger shall each man cried he find a wife for his bosom and each beast have his mate and i be alone i had feelings of affection and they were requited by detestation and scorn man you may hate but beware your hours will pass in dread and misery and soon the bolt will fall which must ravish from you your happiness for ever are you to be happy while i grovel in the intensity of my wretchedness you can blast my other passions but revenge remainsrevenge henceforth dearer than light or food i may die but first you my tyrant and tormentor shall curse the sun that gazes on your misery beware for i am fearless and therefore powerful i will watch with the wiliness of a snake that i may sting with its venom man you shall repent of the injuries you inflict ,Frankenstein
i would have seized him but he eluded me and quitted the house with precipitation in a few moments i saw him in his boat which shot across the waters with an arrowy swiftness and was soon lost amidst the waves ,Frankenstein
all was again silent but his words rang in my ears i burned with rage to pursue the murderer of my peace and precipitate him into the ocean i walked up and down my room hastily and perturbed while my imagination conjured up a thousand images to torment and sting me why had i not followed him and closed with him in mortal strife but i had suffered him to depart and he had directed his course towards the mainland i shuddered to think who might be the next victim sacrificed to his insatiate revenge and then i thought again of his wordsi will be with you on your weddingnight that then was the period fixed for the fulfilment of my destiny in that hour i should die and at once satisfy and extinguish his malice the prospect did not move me to fear yet when i thought of my beloved elizabeth of her tears and endless sorrow when she should find her lover so barbarously snatched from her tears the first i had shed for many months streamed from my eyes and i resolved not to fall before my enemy without a bitter struggle ,Frankenstein
the night passed away and the sun rose from the ocean my feelings became calmer if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into the depths of despair i left the house the horrid scene of the last nights contention and walked on the beach of the sea which i almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow creatures nay a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me i desired that i might pass my life on that barren rock wearily it is true but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery if i returned it was to be sacrificed or to see those whom i most loved die under the grasp of a dmon whom i had myself created ,Frankenstein
i walked about the isle like a restless spectre separated from all it loved and miserable in the separation when it became noon and the sun rose higher i lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep sleep i had been awake the whole of the preceding night my nerves were agitated and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery the sleep into which i now sank refreshed me and when i awoke i again felt as if i belonged to a race of human beings like myself and i began to reflect upon what had passed with greater composure yet still the words of the fiend rang in my ears like a deathknell they appeared like a dream yet distinct and oppressive as a reality ,Frankenstein
the sun had far descended and i still sat on the shore satisfying my appetite which had become ravenous with an oaten cake when i saw a fishingboat land close to me and one of the men brought me a packet it contained letters from geneva and one from clerval entreating me to join him he said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where he was that letters from the friends he had formed in london desired his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his indian enterprise he could not any longer delay his departure but as his journey to london might be followed even sooner than he now conjectured by his longer voyage he entreated me to bestow as much of my society on him as i could spare he besought me therefore to leave my solitary isle and to meet him at perth that we might proceed southwards together this letter in a degree recalled me to life and i determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days ,Frankenstein
yet before i departed there was a task to perform on which i shuddered to reflect i must pack up my chemical instruments and for that purpose i must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work and i must handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me the next morning at daybreak i summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door of my laboratory the remains of the halffinished creature whom i had destroyed lay scattered on the floor and i almost felt as if i had mangled the living flesh of a human being i paused to collect myself and then entered the chamber with trembling hand i conveyed the instruments out of the room but i reflected that i ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants and i accordingly put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and laying them up determined to throw them into the sea that very night and in the meantime i sat upon the beach employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus ,Frankenstein
nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dmon i had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that with whatever consequences must be fulfilled but i now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that i for the first time saw clearly the idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me the threat i had heard weighed on my thoughts but i did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it i had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend i had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness and i banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion ,Frankenstein
between two and three in the morning the moon rose and i then putting my basket aboard a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shore the scene was perfectly solitary a few boats were returning towards land but i sailed away from them i felt as if i was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures at one time the moon which had before been clear was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and i took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea i listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot the sky became clouded but the air was pure although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising but it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that i resolved to prolong my stay on the water and fixing the rudder in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat clouds hid the moon everything was obscure and i heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves the murmur lulled me and in a short time i slept soundly ,Frankenstein
i do not know how long i remained in this situation but when i awoke i found that the sun had already mounted considerably the wind was high and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff i found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which i had embarked i endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if i again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind i confess that i felt a few sensations of terror i had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me i might be driven into the wide atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me i had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst a prelude to my other sufferings i looked on the heavens which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others i looked upon the sea it was to be my grave fiend i exclaimed your task is already fulfilled i thought of elizabeth of my father and of clervalall left behind on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions this idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever i shudder to reflect on it ,Frankenstein
some hours passed thus but by degrees as the sun declined towards the horizon the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers but these gave place to a heavy swell i felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly i saw a line of high land towards the south ,Frankenstein
how mutable are our feelings and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery i constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land it had a wild and rocky appearance but as i approached nearer i easily perceived the traces of cultivation i saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man i carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which i at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory as i was in a state of extreme debility i resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where i could most easily procure nourishment fortunately i had money with me as i turned the promontory i perceived a small neat town and a good harbour which i entered my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape ,Frankenstein
as i was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot they seemed much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm as it was i merely remarked that they spoke english and i therefore addressed them in that language my good friends said i will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where i am ,Frankenstein
i was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and i was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions why do you answer me so roughly i replied surely it is not the custom of englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably ,Frankenstein
while this strange dialogue continued i perceived the crowd rapidly increase their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me i inquired the way to the inn but no one replied i then moved forward and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me when an illlooking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said come sir you must follow me to mr kirwins to give an account of yourself ,Frankenstein
this answer startled me but i presently recovered myself i was innocent that could easily be proved accordingly i followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town i was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger but being surrounded by a crowd i thought it politic to rouse all my strength that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt little did i then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death ,Frankenstein
i was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners he looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion ,Frankenstein
about half a dozen men came forward and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brotherinlaw daniel nugent when about ten oclock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port it was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below he walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance as he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground his companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold they instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life it appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age he had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck ,Frankenstein
the first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned i remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support the magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner ,Frankenstein
the son confirmed his fathers account but when daniel nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which i had just landed ,Frankenstein
a woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found ,Frankenstein
another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house it was not cold they put it into a bed and rubbed it and daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone ,Frankenstein
several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that i had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which i had departed besides they observed that it appeared that i had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as i did not appear to know the shore i might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of  from the place where i had deposited the corpse ,Frankenstein
mr kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that i should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me this idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation i had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described i was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn i could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night but knowing that i had been conversing with several persons in the island i had inhabited about the time that the body had been found i was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair ,Frankenstein
i entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin how can i describe my sensations on beholding it i feel yet parched with horror nor can i reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony the examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when i saw the lifeless form of henry clerval stretched before me i gasped for breath and throwing myself on the body i exclaimed have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest henry of life two i have already destroyed other victims await their destiny but you clerval my friend my benefactor ,Frankenstein
a fever succeeded to this i lay for two months on the point of death my ravings as i afterwards heard were frightful i called myself the murderer of william of justine and of clerval sometimes i entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom i was tormented and at others i felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck and screamed aloud with agony and terror fortunately as i spoke my native language mr kirwin alone understood me but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses ,Frankenstein
why did i not die more miserable than man ever was before why did i not sink into forgetfulness and rest death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doting parents how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb of what materials was i made that i could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning of the wheel continually renewed the torture ,Frankenstein
but i was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream in a prison stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by gaolers turnkeys bolts and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon it was morning i remember when i thus awoke to understanding i had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me but when i looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which i was all flashed across my memory and i groaned bitterly ,Frankenstein
this sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me she was a hired nurse the wife of one of the turnkeys and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class the lines of her face were hard and rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery her tone expressed her entire indifference she addressed me in english and the voice struck me as one that i had heard during my sufferings ,Frankenstein
for that matter replied the old woman if you mean about the gentleman you murdered i believe that it were better for you if you were dead for i fancy it will go hard with you however thats none of my business i am sent to nurse you and get you well i do my duty with a safe conscience it were well if everybody did the same ,Frankenstein
i turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved on the very edge of death but i felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed the whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream i sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality ,Frankenstein
as the images that floated before me became more distinct i grew feverish a darkness pressed around me no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love no dear hand supported me the physician came and prescribed medicines and the old woman prepared them for me but utter carelessness was visible in the first and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee ,Frankenstein
these were my first reflections but i soon learned that mr kirwin had shown me extreme kindness he had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse it is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer he came therefore sometimes to see that i was not neglected but his visits were short and with long intervals ,Frankenstein
one day while i was gradually recovering i was seated in a chair my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death i was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected i had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness at one time i considered whether i should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor justine had been such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and mr kirwin entered his countenance expressed sympathy and compassion he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in french ,Frankenstein
i know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune but you will i hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge ,Frankenstein
nothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the strange chances that have lately occurred you were thrown by some surprising accident on this shore renowned for its hospitality seized immediately and charged with murder the first sight that was presented to your eyes was the body of your friend murdered in so unaccountable a manner and placed as it were by some fiend across your path ,Frankenstein
as mr kirwin said this notwithstanding the agitation i endured on this retrospect of my sufferings i also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me i suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance for mr kirwin hastened to say ,Frankenstein
immediately upon your being taken ill all the papers that were on your person were brought me and i examined them that i might discover some trace by which i could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness i found several letters and among others one which i discovered from its commencement to be from your father i instantly wrote to geneva nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter but you are ill even now you tremble you are unfit for agitation of any kind ,Frankenstein
i know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of clerval as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires i put my hand before my eyes and cried out in agony ,Frankenstein
my change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate perhaps he thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence he rose and quitted the room with my nurse and in a moment my father entered it ,Frankenstein
my father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured by dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart to raise my desponding spirits but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of cheerfulness what a place is this that you inhabit my son said he looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance of the room you travelled to seek happiness but a fatality seems to pursue you and poor clerval ,Frankenstein
we were not allowed to converse for any length of time for the precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that could ensure tranquillity mr kirwin came in and insisted that my strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion but the appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel and i gradually recovered my health ,Frankenstein
as my sickness quitted me i was absorbed by a gloomy and black melancholy that nothing could dissipate the image of clerval was for ever before me ghastly and murdered more than once the agitation into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous relapse alas why did they preserve so miserable and detested a life it was surely that i might fulfil my destiny which is now drawing to a close soon oh very soon will death extinguish these throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears me to the dust and in executing the award of justice i shall also sink to rest then the appearance of death was distant although the wish was ever present to my thoughts and i often sat for hours motionless and speechless wishing for some mighty revolution that might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins ,Frankenstein
the season of the assizes approached i had already been three months in prison and although i was still weak and in continual danger of a relapse i was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country town where the court was held mr kirwin charged himself with every care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence i was spared the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal as the case was not brought before the court that decides on life and death the grand jury rejected the bill on its being proved that i was on the orkney islands at the hour the body of my friend was found and a fortnight after my removal i was liberated from prison ,Frankenstein
my father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a criminal charge that i was again allowed to breathe the fresh atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country i did not participate in these feelings for to me the walls of a dungeon or a palace were alike hateful the cup of life was poisoned for ever and although the sun shone upon me as upon the happy and gay of heart i saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness penetrated by no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me sometimes they were the expressive eyes of henry languishing in death the dark orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed them sometimes it was the watery clouded eyes of the monster as i first saw them in my chamber at ingolstadt ,Frankenstein
my father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection he talked of geneva which i should soon visit of elizabeth and ernest but these words only drew deep groans from me sometimes indeed i felt a wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved cousin or longed with a devouring maladie du pays to see once more the blue lake and rapid rhone that had been so dear to me in early childhood but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature and these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and despair at these moments i often endeavoured to put an end to the existence i loathed and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence ,Frankenstein
yet one duty remained to me the recollection of which finally triumphed over my selfish despair it was necessary that i should return without delay to geneva there to watch over the lives of those i so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer that if any chance led me to the place of his concealment or if he dared again to blast me by his presence i might with unfailing aim put an end to the existence of the monstrous image which i had endued with the mockery of a soul still more monstrous my father still desired to delay our departure fearful that i could not sustain the fatigues of a journey for i was a shattered wreckthe shadow of a human being my strength was gone i was a mere skeleton and fever night and day preyed upon my wasted frame ,Frankenstein
still as i urged our leaving ireland with such inquietude and impatience my father thought it best to yield we took our passage on board a vessel bound for havredegrace and sailed with a fair wind from the irish shores it was midnight i lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to the dashing of the waves i hailed the darkness that shut ireland from my sight and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when i reflected that i should soon see geneva the past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream yet the vessel in which i was the wind that blew me from the detested shore of ireland and the sea which surrounded me told me too forcibly that i was deceived by no vision and that clerval my friend and dearest companion had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation i repassed in my memory my whole life my quiet happiness while residing with my family in geneva the death of my mother and my departure for ingolstadt i remembered shuddering the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on to the creation of my hideous enemy and i called to mind the night in which he first lived i was unable to pursue the train of thought a thousand feelings pressed upon me and i wept bitterly ,Frankenstein
ever since my recovery from the fever i had been in the custom of taking every night a small quantity of laudanum for it was by means of this drug only that i was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of life oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes i now swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly but sleep did not afford me respite from thought and misery my dreams presented a thousand objects that scared me towards morning i was possessed by a kind of nightmare i felt the fiends grasp in my neck and could not free myself from it groans and cries rang in my ears my father who was watching over me perceiving my restlessness awoke me the dashing waves were around the cloudy sky above the fiend was not here a sense of security a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour and the irresistible disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm forgetfulness of which the human mind is by its structure peculiarly susceptible ,Frankenstein
the voyage came to an end we landed and proceeded to paris i soon found that i had overtaxed my strength and that i must repose before i could continue my journey my fathers care and attentions were indefatigable but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and sought erroneous methods to remedy the incurable ill he wished me to seek amusement in society i abhorred the face of man oh not abhorred they were my brethren my fellow beings and i felt attracted even to the most repulsive among them as to creatures of an angelic nature and celestial mechanism but i felt that i had no right to share their intercourse i had unchained an enemy among them whose joy it was to shed their blood and to revel in their groans how they would each and all abhor me and hunt me from the world did they know my unhallowed acts and the crimes which had their source in me ,Frankenstein
my father yielded at length to my desire to avoid society and strove by various arguments to banish my despair sometimes he thought that i felt deeply the degradation of being obliged to answer a charge of murder and he endeavoured to prove to me the futility of pride ,Frankenstein
alas my father said i how little do you know me  human beings their feelings and passions would indeed be degraded if such a wretch as i felt pride justine poor unhappy justine was as innocent as i and she suffered the same charge she died for it and i am the cause of thisi murdered her william justine and henrythey all died by my hands ,Frankenstein
my father had often during my imprisonment heard me make the same assertion when i thus accused myself he sometimes seemed to desire an explanation and at others he appeared to consider it as the offspring of delirium and that during my illness some idea of this kind had presented itself to my imagination the remembrance of which i preserved in my convalescence i avoided explanation and maintained a continual silence concerning the wretch i had created i had a persuasion that i should be supposed mad and this in itself would for ever have chained my tongue but besides i could not bring myself to disclose a secret which would fill my hearer with consternation and make fear and unnatural horror the inmates of his breast i checked therefore my impatient thirst for sympathy and was silent when i would have given the world to have confided the fatal secret yet still words like those i have recorded would burst uncontrollably from me i could offer no explanation of them but their truth in part relieved the burden of my mysterious woe ,Frankenstein
i am not mad i cried energetically the sun and the heavens who have viewed my operations can bear witness of my truth i am the assassin of those most innocent victims they died by my machinations a thousand times would i have shed my own blood drop by drop to have saved their lives but i could not my father indeed i could not sacrifice the whole human race ,Frankenstein
the conclusion of this speech convinced my father that my ideas were deranged and he instantly changed the subject of our conversation and endeavoured to alter the course of my thoughts he wished as much as possible to obliterate the memory of the scenes that had taken place in ireland and never alluded to them or suffered me to speak of my misfortunes ,Frankenstein
as time passed away i became more calm misery had her dwelling in my heart but i no longer talked in the same incoherent manner of my own crimes sufficient for me was the consciousness of them by the utmost selfviolence i curbed the imperious voice of wretchedness which sometimes desired to declare itself to the whole world and my manners were calmer and more composed than they had ever been since my journey to the sea of ice ,Frankenstein
it gave me the greatest pleasure to receive a letter from my uncle dated at paris you are no longer at a formidable distance and i may hope to see you in less than a fortnight my poor cousin how much you must have suffered i expect to see you looking even more ill than when you quitted geneva this winter has been passed most miserably tortured as i have been by anxious suspense yet i hope to see peace in your countenance and to find that your heart is not totally void of comfort and tranquillity ,Frankenstein
yet i fear that the same feelings now exist that made you so miserable a year ago even perhaps augmented by time i would not disturb you at this period when so many misfortunes weigh upon you but a conversation that i had with my uncle previous to his departure renders some explanation necessary before we meet ,Frankenstein
explanation you may possibly say what can elizabeth have to explain if you really say this my questions are answered and all my doubts satisfied but you are distant from me and it is possible that you may dread and yet be pleased with this explanation and in a probability of this being the case i dare not any longer postpone writing what during your absence i have often wished to express to you but have never had the courage to begin ,Frankenstein
you well know victor that our union had been the favourite plan of your parents ever since our infancy we were told this when young and taught to look forward to it as an event that would certainly take place we were affectionate playfellows during childhood and i believe dear and valued friends to one another as we grew older but as brother and sister often entertain a lively affection towards each other without desiring a more intimate union may not such also be our case tell me dearest victor answer me i conjure you by our mutual happiness with simple truthdo you not love another ,Frankenstein
you have travelled you have spent several years of your life at ingolstadt and i confess to you my friend that when i saw you last autumn so unhappy flying to solitude from the society of every creature i could not help supposing that you might regret our connection and believe yourself bound in honour to fulfil the wishes of your parents although they opposed themselves to your inclinations but this is false reasoning i confess to you my friend that i love you and that in my airy dreams of futurity you have been my constant friend and companion but it is your happiness i desire as well as my own when i declare to you that our marriage would render me eternally miserable unless it were the dictate of your own free choice even now i weep to think that borne down as you are by the cruellest misfortunes you may stifle by the word honour all hope of that love and happiness which would alone restore you to yourself i who have so disinterested an affection for you may increase your miseries tenfold by being an obstacle to your wishes ah victor be assured that your cousin and playmate has too sincere a love for you not to be made miserable by this supposition be happy my friend and if you obey me in this one request remain satisfied that nothing on earth will have the power to interrupt my tranquillity ,Frankenstein
do not let this letter disturb you do not answer tomorrow or the next day or even until you come if it will give you pain my uncle will send me news of your health and if i see but one smile on your lips when we meet occasioned by this or any other exertion of mine i shall need no other happiness ,Frankenstein
this letter revived in my memory what i had before forgotten the threat of the fiendi will be with you on your weddingnight such was my sentence and on that night would the dmon employ every art to destroy me and tear me from the glimpse of happiness which promised partly to console my sufferings on that night he had determined to consummate his crimes by my death well be it so a deadly struggle would then assuredly take place in which if he were victorious i should be at peace and his power over me be at an end if he were vanquished i should be a free man alas what freedom such as the peasant enjoys when his family have been massacred before his eyes his cottage burnt his lands laid waste and he is turned adrift homeless penniless and alone but free such would be my liberty except that in my elizabeth i possessed a treasure alas balanced by those horrors of remorse and guilt which would pursue me until death ,Frankenstein
sweet and beloved elizabeth i read and reread her letter and some softened feelings stole into my heart and dared to whisper paradisiacal dreams of love and joy but the apple was already eaten and the angels arm bared to drive me from all hope yet i would die to make her happy if the monster executed his threat death was inevitable yet again i considered whether my marriage would hasten my fate my destruction might indeed arrive a few months sooner but if my torturer should suspect that i postponed it influenced by his menaces he would surely find other and perhaps more dreadful means of revenge he had vowed to be with me on my weddingnight yet he did not consider that threat as binding him to peace in the meantime for as if to show me that he was not yet satiated with blood he had murdered clerval immediately after the enunciation of his threats i resolved therefore that if my immediate union with my cousin would conduce either to hers or my fathers happiness my adversarys designs against my life should not retard it a single hour ,Frankenstein
in this state of mind i wrote to elizabeth my letter was calm and affectionate i fear my beloved girl i said little happiness remains for us on earth yet all that i may one day enjoy is centred in you chase away your idle fears to you alone do i consecrate my life and my endeavours for contentment i have one secret elizabeth a dreadful one when revealed to you it will chill your frame with horror and then far from being surprised at my misery you will only wonder that i survive what i have endured i will confide this tale of misery and terror to you the day after our marriage shall take place for my sweet cousin there must be perfect confidence between us but until then i conjure you do not mention or allude to it this i most earnestly entreat and i know you will comply ,Frankenstein
in about a week after the arrival of elizabeths letter we returned to geneva the sweet girl welcomed me with warm affection yet tears were in her eyes as she beheld my emaciated frame and feverish cheeks i saw a change in her also she was thinner and had lost much of that heavenly vivacity that had before charmed me but her gentleness and soft looks of compassion made her a more fit companion for one blasted and miserable as i was ,Frankenstein
the tranquillity which i now enjoyed did not endure memory brought madness with it and when i thought of what had passed a real insanity possessed me sometimes i was furious and burnt with rage sometimes low and despondent i neither spoke nor looked at anyone but sat motionless bewildered by the multitude of miseries that overcame me ,Frankenstein
elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor she wept with me and for me when reason returned she would remonstrate and endeavour to inspire me with resignation ah it is well for the unfortunate to be resigned but for the guilty there is no peace the agonies of remorse poison the luxury there is otherwise sometimes found in indulging the excess of grief ,Frankenstein
my dear victor do not speak thus heavy misfortunes have befallen us but let us only cling closer to what remains and transfer our love for those whom we have lost to those who yet live our circle will be small but bound close by the ties of affection and mutual misfortune and when time shall have softened your despair new and dear objects of care will be born to replace those of whom we have been so cruelly deprived ,Frankenstein
such were the lessons of my father but to me the remembrance of the threat returned nor can you wonder that omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood i should almost regard him as invincible and that when he had pronounced the words i shall be with you on your weddingnight i should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable but death was no evil to me if the loss of elizabeth were balanced with it and i therefore with a contented and even cheerful countenance agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent the ceremony should take place in ten days and thus put as i imagined the seal to my fate ,Frankenstein
great god if for one instant i had thought what might be the hellish intention of my fiendish adversary i would rather have banished myself for ever from my native country and wandered a friendless outcast over the earth than have consented to this miserable marriage but as if possessed of magic powers the monster had blinded me to his real intentions and when i thought that i had prepared only my own death i hastened that of a far dearer victim ,Frankenstein
as the period fixed for our marriage drew nearer whether from cowardice or a prophetic feeling i felt my heart sink within me but i concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father but hardly deceived the everwatchful and nicer eye of elizabeth she looked forward to our union with placid contentment not unmingled with a little fear which past misfortunes had impressed that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret ,Frankenstein
preparations were made for the event congratulatory visits were received and all wore a smiling appearance i shut up as well as i could in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy through my fathers exertions a part of the inheritance of elizabeth had been restored to her by the austrian government a small possession on the shores of como belonged to her it was agreed that immediately after our union we should proceed to villa lavenza and spend our first days of happiness beside the beautiful lake near which it stood ,Frankenstein
in the meantime i took every precaution to defend my person in case the fiend should openly attack me i carried pistols and a dagger constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice and by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity indeed as the period approached the threat appeared more as a delusion not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness i hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and i heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent ,Frankenstein
elizabeth seemed happy my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind but on the day that was to fulfil my wishes and my destiny she was melancholy and a presentiment of evil pervaded her and perhaps also she thought of the dreadful secret which i had promised to reveal to her on the following day my father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride ,Frankenstein
after the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my fathers but it was agreed that elizabeth and i should commence our journey by water sleeping that night at evian and continuing our voyage on the following day the day was fair the wind favourable all smiled on our nuptial embarkation ,Frankenstein
those were the last moments of my life during which i enjoyed the feeling of happiness we passed rapidly along the sun was hot but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw mont salve the pleasant banks of montalgre and at a distance surmounting all the beautiful mont blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her sometimes coasting the opposite banks we saw the mighty jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it ,Frankenstein
i took the hand of elizabeth you are sorrowful my love ah if you knew what i have suffered and what i may yet endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy ,Frankenstein
be happy my dear victor replied elizabeth there is i hope nothing to distress you and be assured that if a lively joy is not painted in my face my heart is contented something whispers to me not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us but i will not listen to such a sinister voice observe how fast we move along and how the clouds which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise above the dome of mont blanc render this scene of beauty still more interesting look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom what a divine day how happy and serene all nature appears ,Frankenstein
thus elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects but her temper was fluctuating joy for a few instants shone in her eyes but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie ,Frankenstein
the sun sank lower in the heavens we passed the river drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills the alps here come closer to the lake and we approached the amphitheatre of mountains which forms its eastern boundary the spire of evian shone under the woods that surrounded it and the range of mountain above mountain by which it was overhung ,Frankenstein
the wind which had hitherto carried us along with amazing rapidity sank at sunset to a light breeze the soft air just ruffled the water and caused a pleasant motion among the trees as we approached the shore from which it wafted the most delightful scent of flowers and hay the sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed and as i touched the shore i felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever ,Frankenstein
it was eight oclock when we landed we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters woods and mountains obscured in darkness yet still displaying their black outlines ,Frankenstein
the wind which had fallen in the south now rose with great violence in the west the moon had reached her summit in the heavens and was beginning to descend the clouds swept across it swifter than the flight of the vulture and dimmed her rays while the lake reflected the scene of the busy heavens rendered still busier by the restless waves that were beginning to rise suddenly a heavy storm of rain descended ,Frankenstein
i had been calm during the day but so soon as night obscured the shapes of objects a thousand fears arose in my mind i was anxious and watchful while my right hand grasped a pistol which was hidden in my bosom every sound terrified me but i resolved that i would sell my life dearly and not shrink from the conflict until my own life or that of my adversary was extinguished ,Frankenstein
elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her and trembling she asked what is it that agitates you my dear victor what is it you fear ,Frankenstein
i passed an hour in this state of mind when suddenly i reflected how fearful the combat which i momentarily expected would be to my wife and i earnestly entreated her to retire resolving not to join her until i had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy ,Frankenstein
she left me and i continued some time walking up and down the passages of the house and inspecting every corner that might afford a retreat to my adversary but i discovered no trace of him and was beginning to conjecture that some fortunate chance had intervened to prevent the execution of his menaces when suddenly i heard a shrill and dreadful scream it came from the room into which elizabeth had retired as i heard it the whole truth rushed into my mind my arms dropped the motion of every muscle and fibre was suspended i could feel the blood trickling in my veins and tingling in the extremities of my limbs this state lasted but for an instant the scream was repeated and i rushed into the room ,Frankenstein
great god why did i not then expire why am i here to relate the destruction of the best hope and the purest creature on earth she was there lifeless and inanimate thrown across the bed her head hanging down and her pale and distorted features half covered by her hair everywhere i turn i see the same figureher bloodless arms and relaxed form flung by the murderer on its bridal bier could i behold this and live alas life is obstinate and clings closest where it is most hated for a moment only did i lose recollection i fell senseless on the ground ,Frankenstein
when i recovered i found myself surrounded by the people of the inn their countenances expressed a breathless terror but the horror of others appeared only as a mockery a shadow of the feelings that oppressed me i escaped from them to the room where lay the body of elizabeth my love my wife so lately living so dear so worthy she had been moved from the posture in which i had first beheld her and now as she lay her head upon her arm and a handkerchief thrown across her face and neck i might have supposed her asleep i rushed towards her and embraced her with ardour but the deadly languor and coldness of the limbs told me that what i now held in my arms had ceased to be the elizabeth whom i had loved and cherished the murderous mark of the fiends grasp was on her neck and the breath had ceased to issue from her lips ,Frankenstein
while i still hung over her in the agony of despair i happened to look up the windows of the room had before been darkened and i felt a kind of panic on seeing the pale yellow light of the moon illuminate the chamber the shutters had been thrown back and with a sensation of horror not to be described i saw at the open window a figure the most hideous and abhorred a grin was on the face of the monster he seemed to jeer as with his fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife i rushed towards the window and drawing a pistol from my bosom fired but he eluded me leaped from his station and running with the swiftness of lightning plunged into the lake ,Frankenstein
the report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room i pointed to the spot where he had disappeared and we followed the track with boats nets were cast but in vain after passing several hours we returned hopeless most of my companions believing it to have been a form conjured up by my fancy after having landed they proceeded to search the country parties going in different directions among the woods and vines ,Frankenstein
i attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the house but my head whirled round my steps were like those of a drunken man i fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion a film covered my eyes and my skin was parched with the heat of fever in this state i was carried back and placed on a bed hardly conscious of what had happened my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that i had lost ,Frankenstein
after an interval i arose and as if by instinct crawled into the room where the corpse of my beloved lay there were women weeping around i hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs all this time no distinct idea presented itself to my mind but my thoughts rambled to various subjects reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their cause i was bewildered in a cloud of wonder and horror the death of william the execution of justine the murder of clerval and lastly of my wife even at that moment i knew not that my only remaining friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend my father even now might be writhing under his grasp and ernest might be dead at his feet this idea made me shudder and recalled me to action i started up and resolved to return to geneva with all possible speed ,Frankenstein
there were no horses to be procured and i must return by the lake but the wind was unfavourable and the rain fell in torrents however it was hardly morning and i might reasonably hope to arrive by night i hired men to row and took an oar myself for i had always experienced relief from mental torment in bodily exercise but the overflowing misery i now felt and the excess of agitation that i endured rendered me incapable of any exertion i threw down the oar and leaning my head upon my hands gave way to every gloomy idea that arose if i looked up i saw scenes which were familiar to me in my happier time and which i had contemplated but the day before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection tears streamed from my eyes the rain had ceased for a moment and i saw the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before they had then been observed by elizabeth nothing is so painful to the human mind as a great and sudden change the sun might shine or the clouds might lower but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before a fiend had snatched from me every hope of future happiness no creature had ever been so miserable as i was so frightful an event is single in the history of man ,Frankenstein
but why should i dwell upon the incidents that followed this last overwhelming event mine has been a tale of horrors i have reached their acme and what i must now relate can but be tedious to you know that one by one my friends were snatched away i was left desolate my own strength is exhausted and i must tell in a few words what remains of my hideous narration ,Frankenstein
i arrived at geneva my father and ernest yet lived but the former sunk under the tidings that i bore i see him now excellent and venerable old man his eyes wandered in vacancy for they had lost their charm and their delighthis elizabeth his more than daughter whom he doted on with all that affection which a man feels who in the decline of life having few affections clings more earnestly to those that remain cursed cursed be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste in wretchedness he could not live under the horrors that were accumulated around him the springs of existence suddenly gave way he was unable to rise from his bed and in a few days he died in my arms ,Frankenstein
what then became of me i know not i lost sensation and chains and darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me sometimes indeed i dreamt that i wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales with the friends of my youth but i awoke and found myself in a dungeon melancholy followed but by degrees i gained a clear conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my prison for they had called me mad and during many months as i understood a solitary cell had been my habitation ,Frankenstein
liberty however had been a useless gift to me had i not as i awakened to reason at the same time awakened to revenge as the memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me i began to reflect on their causethe monster whom i had created the miserable dmon whom i had sent abroad into the world for my destruction i was possessed by a maddening rage when i thought of him and desired and ardently prayed that i might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal revenge on his cursed head ,Frankenstein
nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes i began to reflect on the best means of securing him and for this purpose about a month after my release i repaired to a criminal judge in the town and told him that i had an accusation to make that i knew the destroyer of my family and that i required him to exert his whole authority for the apprehension of the murderer ,Frankenstein
i thank you replied i listen therefore to the deposition that i have to make it is indeed a tale so strange that i should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth which however wonderful forces conviction the story is too connected to be mistaken for a dream and i have no motive for falsehood my manner as i thus addressed him was impressive but calm i had formed in my own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death and this purpose quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life i now related my history briefly but with firmness and precision marking the dates with accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation ,Frankenstein
the magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous but as i continued he became more attentive and interested i saw him sometimes shudder with horror at others a lively surprise unmingled with disbelief was painted on his countenance ,Frankenstein
when i had concluded my narration i said this is the being whom i accuse and for whose seizure and punishment i call upon you to exert your whole power it is your duty as a magistrate and i believe and hope that your feelings as a man will not revolt from the execution of those functions on this occasion ,Frankenstein
this address caused a considerable change in the physiognomy of my own auditor he had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given to a tale of spirits and supernatural events but when he was called upon to act officially in consequence the whole tide of his incredulity returned he however answered mildly i would willingly afford you every aid in your pursuit but the creature of whom you speak appears to have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance who can follow an animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where no man would venture to intrude besides some months have elapsed since the commission of his crimes and no one can conjecture to what place he has wandered or what region he may now inhabit ,Frankenstein
i do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which i inhabit and if he has indeed taken refuge in the alps he may be hunted like the chamois and destroyed as a beast of prey but i perceive your thoughts you do not credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the punishment which is his desert ,Frankenstein
as i spoke rage sparkled in my eyes the magistrate was intimidated you are mistaken said he i will exert myself and if it is in my power to seize the monster be assured that he shall suffer punishment proportionate to his crimes but i fear from what you have yourself described to be his properties that this will prove impracticable and thus while every proper measure is pursued you should make up your mind to disappointment ,Frankenstein
that cannot be but all that i can say will be of little avail my revenge is of no moment to you yet while i allow it to be a vice i confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul my rage is unspeakable when i reflect that the murderer whom i have turned loose upon society still exists you refuse my just demand i have but one resource and i devote myself either in my life or death to his destruction ,Frankenstein
i trembled with excess of agitation as i said this there was a frenzy in my manner and something i doubt not of that haughty fierceness which the martyrs of old are said to have possessed but to a genevan magistrate whose mind was occupied by far other ideas than those of devotion and heroism this elevation of mind had much the appearance of madness he endeavoured to soothe me as a nurse does a child and reverted to my tale as the effects of delirium ,Frankenstein
my present situation was one in which all voluntary thought was swallowed up and lost i was hurried away by fury revenge alone endowed me with strength and composure it moulded my feelings and allowed me to be calculating and calm at periods when otherwise delirium or death would have been my portion ,Frankenstein
my first resolution was to quit geneva for ever my country which when i was happy and beloved was dear to me now in my adversity became hateful i provided myself with a sum of money together with a few jewels which had belonged to my mother and departed ,Frankenstein
and now my wanderings began which are to cease but with life i have traversed a vast portion of the earth and have endured all the hardships which travellers in deserts and barbarous countries are wont to meet how i have lived i hardly know many times have i stretched my failing limbs upon the sandy plain and prayed for death but revenge kept me alive i dared not die and leave my adversary in being ,Frankenstein
when i quitted geneva my first labour was to gain some clue by which i might trace the steps of my fiendish enemy but my plan was unsettled and i wandered many hours round the confines of the town uncertain what path i should pursue as night approached i found myself at the entrance of the cemetery where william elizabeth and my father reposed i entered it and approached the tomb which marked their graves everything was silent except the leaves of the trees which were gently agitated by the wind the night was nearly dark and the scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested observer the spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to cast a shadow which was felt but not seen around the head of the mourner ,Frankenstein
the deep grief which this scene had at first excited quickly gave way to rage and despair they were dead and i lived their murderer also lived and to destroy him i must drag out my weary existence i knelt on the grass and kissed the earth and with quivering lips exclaimed by the sacred earth on which i kneel by the shades that wander near me by the deep and eternal grief that i feel i swear and by thee o night and the spirits that preside over thee to pursue the dmon who caused this misery until he or i shall perish in mortal conflict for this purpose i will preserve my life to execute this dear revenge will i again behold the sun and tread the green herbage of earth which otherwise should vanish from my eyes for ever and i call on you spirits of the dead and on you wandering ministers of vengeance to aid and conduct me in my work let the cursed and hellish monster drink deep of agony let him feel the despair that now torments me ,Frankenstein
i was answered through the stillness of night by a loud and fiendish laugh it rang on my ears long and heavily the mountains reechoed it and i felt as if all hell surrounded me with mockery and laughter surely in that moment i should have been possessed by frenzy and have destroyed my miserable existence but that my vow was heard and that i was reserved for vengeance the laughter died away when a wellknown and abhorred voice apparently close to my ear addressed me in an audible whisper i am satisfied miserable wretch you have determined to live and i am satisfied ,Frankenstein
i darted towards the spot from which the sound proceeded but the devil eluded my grasp suddenly the broad disk of the moon arose and shone full upon his ghastly and distorted shape as he fled with more than mortal speed ,Frankenstein
i pursued him and for many months this has been my task guided by a slight clue i followed the windings of the rhone but vainly the blue mediterranean appeared and by a strange chance i saw the fiend enter by night and hide himself in a vessel bound for the black sea i took my passage in the same ship but he escaped i know not how ,Frankenstein
amidst the wilds of tartary and russia although he still evaded me i have ever followed in his track sometimes the peasants scared by this horrid apparition informed me of his path sometimes he himself who feared that if i lost all trace of him i should despair and die left some mark to guide me the snows descended on my head and i saw the print of his huge step on the white plain to you first entering on life to whom care is new and agony unknown how can you understand what i have felt and still feel cold want and fatigue were the least pains which i was destined to endure i was cursed by some devil and carried about with me my eternal hell yet still a spirit of good followed and directed my steps and when i most murmured would suddenly extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties sometimes when nature overcome by hunger sank under the exhaustion a repast was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me the fare was indeed coarse such as the peasants of the country ate but i will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that i had invoked to aid me often when all was dry the heavens cloudless and i was parched by thirst a slight cloud would bedim the sky shed the few drops that revived me and vanish ,Frankenstein
i followed when i could the courses of the rivers but the dmon generally avoided these as it was here that the population of the country chiefly collected in other places human beings were seldom seen and i generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my path i had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers by distributing it or i brought with me some food that i had killed which after taking a small part i always presented to those who had provided me with fire and utensils for cooking ,Frankenstein
my life as it passed thus was indeed hateful to me and it was during sleep alone that i could taste joy o blessed sleep often when most miserable i sank to repose and my dreams lulled me even to rapture the spirits that guarded me had provided these moments or rather hours of happiness that i might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage deprived of this respite i should have sunk under my hardships during the day i was sustained and inspirited by the hope of night for in sleep i saw my friends my wife and my beloved country again i saw the benevolent countenance of my father heard the silver tones of my elizabeths voice and beheld clerval enjoying health and youth often when wearied by a toilsome march i persuaded myself that i was dreaming until night should come and that i should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest friends what agonising fondness did i feel for them how did i cling to their dear forms as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours and persuade myself that they still lived at such moments vengeance that burned within me died in my heart and i pursued my path towards the destruction of the dmon more as a task enjoined by heaven as the mechanical impulse of some power of which i was unconscious than as the ardent desire of my soul ,Frankenstein
what his feelings were whom i pursued i cannot know sometimes indeed he left marks in writing on the barks of the trees or cut in stone that guided me and instigated my fury my reign is not yet overthese words were legible in one of these inscriptionsyou live and my power is complete follow me i seek the everlasting ices of the north where you will feel the misery of cold and frost to which i am impassive you will find near this place if you follow not too tardily a dead hare eat and be refreshed come on my enemy we have yet to wrestle for our lives but many hard and miserable hours must you endure until that period shall arrive ,Frankenstein
scoffing devil again do i vow vengeance again do i devote thee miserable fiend to torture and death never will i give up my search until he or i perish and then with what ecstasy shall i join my elizabeth and my departed friends who even now prepare for me the reward of my tedious toil and horrible pilgrimage ,Frankenstein
as i still pursued my journey to the northward the snows thickened and the cold increased in a degree almost too severe to support the peasants were shut up in their hovels and only a few of the most hardy ventured forth to seize the animals whom starvation had forced from their hidingplaces to seek for prey the rivers were covered with ice and no fish could be procured and thus i was cut off from my chief article of maintenance ,Frankenstein
the triumph of my enemy increased with the difficulty of my labours one inscription that he left was in these words prepare your toils only begin wrap yourself in furs and provide food for we shall soon enter upon a journey where your sufferings will satisfy my everlasting hatred ,Frankenstein
my courage and perseverance were invigorated by these scoffing words i resolved not to fail in my purpose and calling on heaven to support me i continued with unabated fervour to traverse immense deserts until the ocean appeared at a distance and formed the utmost boundary of the horizon oh how unlike it was to the blue seasons of the south covered with ice it was only to be distinguished from land by its superior wildness and ruggedness the greeks wept for joy when they beheld the mediterranean from the hills of asia and hailed with rapture the boundary of their toils i did not weep but i knelt down and with a full heart thanked my guiding spirit for conducting me in safety to the place where i hoped notwithstanding my adversarys gibe to meet and grapple with him ,Frankenstein
some weeks before this period i had procured a sledge and dogs and thus traversed the snows with inconceivable speed i know not whether the fiend possessed the same advantages but i found that as before i had daily lost ground in the pursuit i now gained on him so much so that when i first saw the ocean he was but one days journey in advance and i hoped to intercept him before he should reach the beach with new courage therefore i pressed on and in two days arrived at a wretched hamlet on the seashore i inquired of the inhabitants concerning the fiend and gained accurate information a gigantic monster they said had arrived the night before armed with a gun and many pistols putting to flight the inhabitants of a solitary cottage through fear of his terrific appearance he had carried off their store of winter food and placing it in a sledge to draw which he had seized on a numerous drove of trained dogs he had harnessed them and the same night to the joy of the horrorstruck villagers had pursued his journey across the sea in a direction that led to no land and they conjectured that he must speedily be destroyed by the breaking of the ice or frozen by the eternal frosts ,Frankenstein
on hearing this information i suffered a temporary access of despair he had escaped me and i must commence a destructive and almost endless journey across the mountainous ices of the ocean amidst cold that few of the inhabitants could long endure and which i the native of a genial and sunny climate could not hope to survive yet at the idea that the fiend should live and be triumphant my rage and vengeance returned and like a mighty tide overwhelmed every other feeling after a slight repose during which the spirits of the dead hovered round and instigated me to toil and revenge i prepared for my journey ,Frankenstein
i cannot guess how many days have passed since then but i have endured misery which nothing but the eternal sentiment of a just retribution burning within my heart could have enabled me to support immense and rugged mountains of ice often barred up my passage and i often heard the thunder of the ground sea which threatened my destruction but again the frost came and made the paths of the sea secure ,Frankenstein
by the quantity of provision which i had consumed i should guess that i had passed three weeks in this journey and the continual protraction of hope returning back upon the heart often wrung bitter drops of despondency and grief from my eyes despair had indeed almost secured her prey and i should soon have sunk beneath this misery once after the poor animals that conveyed me had with incredible toil gained the summit of a sloping ice mountain and one sinking under his fatigue died i viewed the expanse before me with anguish when suddenly my eye caught a dark speck upon the dusky plain i strained my sight to discover what it could be and uttered a wild cry of ecstasy when i distinguished a sledge and the distorted proportions of a wellknown form within oh with what a burning gush did hope revisit my heart warm tears filled my eyes which i hastily wiped away that they might not intercept the view i had of the dmon but still my sight was dimmed by the burning drops until giving way to the emotions that oppressed me i wept aloud ,Frankenstein
but this was not the time for delay i disencumbered the dogs of their dead companion gave them a plentiful portion of food and after an hours rest which was absolutely necessary and yet which was bitterly irksome to me i continued my route the sledge was still visible nor did i again lose sight of it except at the moments when for a short time some icerock concealed it with its intervening crags i indeed perceptibly gained on it and when after nearly two days journey i beheld my enemy at no more than a mile distant my heart bounded within me ,Frankenstein
but now when i appeared almost within grasp of my foe my hopes were suddenly extinguished and i lost all trace of him more utterly than i had ever done before a ground sea was heard the thunder of its progress as the waters rolled and swelled beneath me became every moment more ominous and terrific i pressed on but in vain the wind arose the sea roared and as with the mighty shock of an earthquake it split and cracked with a tremendous and overwhelming sound the work was soon finished in a few minutes a tumultuous sea rolled between me and my enemy and i was left drifting on a scattered piece of ice that was continually lessening and thus preparing for me a hideous death ,Frankenstein
in this manner many appalling hours passed several of my dogs died and i myself was about to sink under the accumulation of distress when i saw your vessel riding at anchor and holding forth to me hopes of succour and life i had no conception that vessels ever came so far north and was astounded at the sight i quickly destroyed part of my sledge to construct oars and by these means was enabled with infinite fatigue to move my ice raft in the direction of your ship i had determined if you were going southwards still to trust myself to the mercy of the seas rather than abandon my purpose i hoped to induce you to grant me a boat with which i could pursue my enemy but your direction was northwards you took me on board when my vigour was exhausted and i should soon have sunk under my multiplied hardships into a death which i still dread for my task is unfulfilled ,Frankenstein
oh when will my guiding spirit in conducting me to the dmon allow me the rest i so much desire or must i die and he yet live if i do swear to me walton that he shall not escape that you will seek him and satisfy my vengeance in his death and do i dare to ask of you to undertake my pilgrimage to endure the hardships that i have undergone no i am not so selfish yet when i am dead if he should appear if the ministers of vengeance should conduct him to you swear that he shall not liveswear that he shall not triumph over my accumulated woes and survive to add to the list of his dark crimes he is eloquent and persuasive and once his words had even power over my heart but trust him not his soul is as hellish as his form full of treachery and fiendlike malice hear him not call on the names of william justine clerval elizabeth my father and of the wretched victor and thrust your sword into his heart i will hover near and direct the steel aright ,Frankenstein
you have read this strange and terrific story margaret and do you not feel your blood congeal with horror like that which even now curdles mine sometimes seized with sudden agony he could not continue his tale at others his voice broken yet piercing uttered with difficulty the words so replete with anguish his fine and lovely eyes were now lighted up with indignation now subdued to downcast sorrow and quenched in infinite wretchedness sometimes he commanded his countenance and tones and related the most horrible incidents with a tranquil voice suppressing every mark of agitation then like a volcano bursting forth his face would suddenly change to an expression of the wildest rage as he shrieked out imprecations on his persecutor ,Frankenstein
his tale is connected and told with an appearance of the simplest truth yet i own to you that the letters of felix and safie which he showed me and the apparition of the monster seen from our ship brought to me a greater conviction of the truth of his narrative than his asseverations however earnest and connected such a monster has then really existence i cannot doubt it yet i am lost in surprise and admiration sometimes i endeavoured to gain from frankenstein the particulars of his creatures formation but on this point he was impenetrable ,Frankenstein
are you mad my friend said he or whither does your senseless curiosity lead you would you also create for yourself and the world a demoniacal enemy peace peace learn my miseries and do not seek to increase your own ,Frankenstein
frankenstein discovered that i made notes concerning his history he asked to see them and then himself corrected and augmented them in many places but principally in giving the life and spirit to the conversations he held with his enemy since you have preserved my narration said he i would not that a mutilated one should go down to posterity ,Frankenstein
thus has a week passed away while i have listened to the strangest tale that ever imagination formed my thoughts and every feeling of my soul have been drunk up by the interest for my guest which this tale and his own elevated and gentle manners have created i wish to soothe him yet can i counsel one so infinitely miserable so destitute of every hope of consolation to live oh no the only joy that he can now know will be when he composes his shattered spirit to peace and death yet he enjoys one comfort the offspring of solitude and delirium he believes that when in dreams he holds converse with his friends and derives from that communion consolation for his miseries or excitements to his vengeance that they are not the creations of his fancy but the beings themselves who visit him from the regions of a remote world this faith gives a solemnity to his reveries that render them to me almost as imposing and interesting as truth ,Frankenstein
our conversations are not always confined to his own history and misfortunes on every point of general literature he displays unbounded knowledge and a quick and piercing apprehension his eloquence is forcible and touching nor can i hear him when he relates a pathetic incident or endeavours to move the passions of pity or love without tears what a glorious creature must he have been in the days of his prosperity when he is thus noble and godlike in ruin he seems to feel his own worth and the greatness of his fall ,Frankenstein
when younger said he i believed myself destined for some great enterprise my feelings are profound but i possessed a coolness of judgment that fitted me for illustrious achievements this sentiment of the worth of my nature supported me when others would have been oppressed for i deemed it criminal to throw away in useless grief those talents that might be useful to my fellow creatures when i reflected on the work i had completed no less a one than the creation of a sensitive and rational animal i could not rank myself with the herd of common projectors but this thought which supported me in the commencement of my career now serves only to plunge me lower in the dust all my speculations and hopes are as nothing and like the archangel who aspired to omnipotence i am chained in an eternal hell my imagination was vivid yet my powers of analysis and application were intense by the union of these qualities i conceived the idea and executed the creation of a man even now i cannot recollect without passion my reveries while the work was incomplete i trod heaven in my thoughts now exulting in my powers now burning with the idea of their effects from my infancy i was imbued with high hopes and a lofty ambition but how am i sunk oh my friend if you had known me as i once was you would not recognise me in this state of degradation despondency rarely visited my heart a high destiny seemed to bear me on until i fell never never again to rise ,Frankenstein
must i then lose this admirable being i have longed for a friend i have sought one who would sympathise with and love me behold on these desert seas i have found such a one but i fear i have gained him only to know his value and lose him i would reconcile him to life but he repulses the idea ,Frankenstein
i thank you walton he said for your kind intentions towards so miserable a wretch but when you speak of new ties and fresh affections think you that any can replace those who are gone can any man be to me as clerval was or any woman another elizabeth even where the affections are not strongly moved by any superior excellence the companions of our childhood always possess a certain power over our minds which hardly any later friend can obtain they know our infantine dispositions which however they may be afterwards modified are never eradicated and they can judge of our actions with more certain conclusions as to the integrity of our motives a sister or a brother can never unless indeed such symptoms have been shown early suspect the other of fraud or false dealing when another friend however strongly he may be attached may in spite of himself be contemplated with suspicion but i enjoyed friends dear not only through habit and association but from their own merits and wherever i am the soothing voice of my elizabeth and the conversation of clerval will be ever whispered in my ear they are dead and but one feeling in such a solitude can persuade me to preserve my life if i were engaged in any high undertaking or design fraught with extensive utility to my fellow creatures then could i live to fulfil it but such is not my destiny i must pursue and destroy the being to whom i gave existence then my lot on earth will be fulfilled and i may die ,Frankenstein
i write to you encompassed by peril and ignorant whether i am ever doomed to see again dear england and the dearer friends that inhabit it i am surrounded by mountains of ice which admit of no escape and threaten every moment to crush my vessel the brave fellows whom i have persuaded to be my companions look towards me for aid but i have none to bestow there is something terribly appalling in our situation yet my courage and hopes do not desert me yet it is terrible to reflect that the lives of all these men are endangered through me if we are lost my mad schemes are the cause ,Frankenstein
and what margaret will be the state of your mind you will not hear of my destruction and you will anxiously await my return years will pass and you will have visitings of despair and yet be tortured by hope oh my beloved sister the sickening failing of your heartfelt expectations is in prospect more terrible to me than my own death but you have a husband and lovely children you may be happy heaven bless you and make you so ,Frankenstein
my unfortunate guest regards me with the tenderest compassion he endeavours to fill me with hope and talks as if life were a possession which he valued he reminds me how often the same accidents have happened to other navigators who have attempted this sea and in spite of myself he fills me with cheerful auguries even the sailors feel the power of his eloquence when he speaks they no longer despair he rouses their energies and while they hear his voice they believe these vast mountains of ice are molehills which will vanish before the resolutions of man these feelings are transitory each day of expectation delayed fills them with fear and i almost dread a mutiny caused by this despair ,Frankenstein
we are still surrounded by mountains of ice still in imminent danger of being crushed in their conflict the cold is excessive and many of my unfortunate comrades have already found a grave amidst this scene of desolation frankenstein has daily declined in health a feverish fire still glimmers in his eyes but he is exhausted and when suddenly roused to any exertion he speedily sinks again into apparent lifelessness ,Frankenstein
i mentioned in my last letter the fears i entertained of a mutiny this morning as i sat watching the wan countenance of my friendhis eyes half closed and his limbs hanging listlesslyi was roused by half a dozen of the sailors who demanded admission into the cabin they entered and their leader addressed me he told me that he and his companions had been chosen by the other sailors to come in deputation to me to make me a requisition which in justice i could not refuse we were immured in ice and should probably never escape but they feared that if as was possible the ice should dissipate and a free passage be opened i should be rash enough to continue my voyage and lead them into fresh dangers after they might happily have surmounted this they insisted therefore that i should engage with a solemn promise that if the vessel should be freed i would instantly direct my course southwards ,Frankenstein
this speech troubled me i had not despaired nor had i yet conceived the idea of returning if set free yet could i in justice or even in possibility refuse this demand i hesitated before i answered when frankenstein who had at first been silent and indeed appeared hardly to have force enough to attend now roused himself his eyes sparkled and his cheeks flushed with momentary vigour turning towards the men he said ,Frankenstein
what do you mean what do you demand of your captain are you then so easily turned from your design did you not call this a glorious expedition and wherefore was it glorious not because the way was smooth and placid as a southern sea but because it was full of dangers and terror because at every new incident your fortitude was to be called forth and your courage exhibited because danger and death surrounded it and these you were to brave and overcome for this was it a glorious for this was it an honourable undertaking you were hereafter to be hailed as the benefactors of your species your names adored as belonging to brave men who encountered death for honour and the benefit of mankind and now behold with the first imagination of danger or if you will the first mighty and terrific trial of your courage you shrink away and are content to be handed down as men who had not strength enough to endure cold and peril and so poor souls they were chilly and returned to their warm firesides why that requires not this preparation ye need not have come thus far and dragged your captain to the shame of a defeat merely to prove yourselves cowards oh be men or be more than men be steady to your purposes and firm as a rock this ice is not made of such stuff as your hearts may be it is mutable and cannot withstand you if you say that it shall not do not return to your families with the stigma of disgrace marked on your brows return as heroes who have fought and conquered and who know not what it is to turn their backs on the foe ,Frankenstein
he spoke this with a voice so modulated to the different feelings expressed in his speech with an eye so full of lofty design and heroism that can you wonder that these men were moved they looked at one another and were unable to reply i spoke i told them to retire and consider of what had been said that i would not lead them farther north if they strenuously desired the contrary but that i hoped that with reflection their courage would return ,Frankenstein
how all this will terminate i know not but i had rather die than return shamefully my purpose unfulfilled yet i fear such will be my fate the men unsupported by ideas of glory and honour can never willingly continue to endure their present hardships ,Frankenstein
the die is cast i have consented to return if we are not destroyed thus are my hopes blasted by cowardice and indecision i come back ignorant and disappointed it requires more philosophy than i possess to bear this injustice with patience ,Frankenstein
it is past i am returning to england i have lost my hopes of utility and glory i have lost my friend but i will endeavour to detail these bitter circumstances to you my dear sister and while i am wafted towards england and towards you i will not despond ,Frankenstein
september th the ice began to move and roarings like thunder were heard at a distance as the islands split and cracked in every direction we were in the most imminent peril but as we could only remain passive my chief attention was occupied by my unfortunate guest whose illness increased in such a degree that he was entirely confined to his bed the ice cracked behind us and was driven with force towards the north a breeze sprang from the west and on the th the passage towards the south became perfectly free when the sailors saw this and that their return to their native country was apparently assured a shout of tumultuous joy broke from them loud and longcontinued frankenstein who was dozing awoke and asked the cause of the tumult they shout i said because they will soon return to england ,Frankenstein
do so if you will but i will not you may give up your purpose but mine is assigned to me by heaven and i dare not i am weak but surely the spirits who assist my vengeance will endow me with sufficient strength saying this he endeavoured to spring from the bed but the exertion was too great for him he fell back and fainted ,Frankenstein
it was long before he was restored and i often thought that life was entirely extinct at length he opened his eyes he breathed with difficulty and was unable to speak the surgeon gave him a composing draught and ordered us to leave him undisturbed in the meantime he told me that my friend had certainly not many hours to live ,Frankenstein
his sentence was pronounced and i could only grieve and be patient i sat by his bed watching him his eyes were closed and i thought he slept but presently he called to me in a feeble voice and bidding me come near said alas the strength i relied on is gone i feel that i shall soon die and he my enemy and persecutor may still be in being think not walton that in the last moments of my existence i feel that burning hatred and ardent desire of revenge i once expressed but i feel myself justified in desiring the death of my adversary during these last days i have been occupied in examining my past conduct nor do i find it blamable in a fit of enthusiastic madness i created a rational creature and was bound towards him to assure as far as was in my power his happiness and wellbeing this was my duty but there was another still paramount to that my duties towards the beings of my own species had greater claims to my attention because they included a greater proportion of happiness or misery urged by this view i refused and i did right in refusing to create a companion for the first creature he showed unparalleled malignity and selfishness in evil he destroyed my friends he devoted to destruction beings who possessed exquisite sensations happiness and wisdom nor do i know where this thirst for vengeance may end miserable himself that he may render no other wretched he ought to die the task of his destruction was mine but i have failed when actuated by selfish and vicious motives i asked you to undertake my unfinished work and i renew this request now when i am only induced by reason and virtue ,Frankenstein
yet i cannot ask you to renounce your country and friends to fulfil this task and now that you are returning to england you will have little chance of meeting with him but the consideration of these points and the well balancing of what you may esteem your duties i leave to you my judgment and ideas are already disturbed by the near approach of death i dare not ask you to do what i think right for i may still be misled by passion ,Frankenstein
that he should live to be an instrument of mischief disturbs me in other respects this hour when i momentarily expect my release is the only happy one which i have enjoyed for several years the forms of the beloved dead flit before me and i hasten to their arms farewell walton seek happiness in tranquillity and avoid ambition even if it be only the apparently innocent one of distinguishing yourself in science and discoveries yet why do i say this i have myself been blasted in these hopes yet another may succeed ,Frankenstein
his voice became fainter as he spoke and at length exhausted by his effort he sank into silence about half an hour afterwards he attempted again to speak but was unable he pressed my hand feebly and his eyes closed for ever while the irradiation of a gentle smile passed away from his lips ,Frankenstein
margaret what comment can i make on the untimely extinction of this glorious spirit what can i say that will enable you to understand the depth of my sorrow all that i should express would be inadequate and feeble my tears flow my mind is overshadowed by a cloud of disappointment but i journey towards england and i may there find consolation ,Frankenstein
i am interrupted what do these sounds portend it is midnight the breeze blows fairly and the watch on deck scarcely stir again there is a sound as of a human voice but hoarser it comes from the cabin where the remains of frankenstein still lie i must arise and examine good night my sister ,Frankenstein
great god what a scene has just taken place i am yet dizzy with the remembrance of it i hardly know whether i shall have the power to detail it yet the tale which i have recorded would be incomplete without this final and wonderful catastrophe ,Frankenstein
i entered the cabin where lay the remains of my illfated and admirable friend over him hung a form which i cannot find words to describegigantic in stature yet uncouth and distorted in its proportions as he hung over the coffin his face was concealed by long locks of ragged hair but one vast hand was extended in colour and apparent texture like that of a mummy when he heard the sound of my approach he ceased to utter exclamations of grief and horror and sprung towards the window never did i behold a vision so horrible as his face of such loathsome yet appalling hideousness i shut my eyes involuntarily and endeavoured to recollect what were my duties with regard to this destroyer i called on him to stay ,Frankenstein
he paused looking on me with wonder and again turning towards the lifeless form of his creator he seemed to forget my presence and every feature and gesture seemed instigated by the wildest rage of some uncontrollable passion ,Frankenstein
that is also my victim he exclaimed in his murder my crimes are consummated the miserable series of my being is wound to its close oh frankenstein generous and selfdevoted being what does it avail that i now ask thee to pardon me i who irretrievably destroyed thee by destroying all thou lovedst alas he is cold he cannot answer me ,Frankenstein
his voice seemed suffocated and my first impulses which had suggested to me the duty of obeying the dying request of my friend in destroying his enemy were now suspended by a mixture of curiosity and compassion i approached this tremendous being i dared not again raise my eyes to his face there was something so scaring and unearthly in his ugliness i attempted to speak but the words died away on my lips the monster continued to utter wild and incoherent selfreproaches at length i gathered resolution to address him in a pause of the tempest of his passion ,Frankenstein
your repentance i said is now superfluous if you had listened to the voice of conscience and heeded the stings of remorse before you had urged your diabolical vengeance to this extremity frankenstein would yet have lived ,Frankenstein
and do you dream said the dmon do you think that i was then dead to agony and remorse he he continued pointing to the corpse he suffered not in the consummation of the deed oh not the tenthousandth portion of the anguish that was mine during the lingering detail of its execution a frightful selfishness hurried me on while my heart was poisoned with remorse think you that the groans of clerval were music to my ears my heart was fashioned to be susceptible of love and sympathy and when wrenched by misery to vice and hatred it did not endure the violence of the change without torture such as you cannot even imagine ,Frankenstein
after the murder of clerval i returned to switzerland heartbroken and overcome i pitied frankenstein my pity amounted to horror i abhorred myself but when i discovered that he the author at once of my existence and of its unspeakable torments dared to hope for happiness that while he accumulated wretchedness and despair upon me he sought his own enjoyment in feelings and passions from the indulgence of which i was for ever barred then impotent envy and bitter indignation filled me with an insatiable thirst for vengeance i recollected my threat and resolved that it should be accomplished i knew that i was preparing for myself a deadly torture but i was the slave not the master of an impulse which i detested yet could not disobey yet when she died nay then i was not miserable i had cast off all feeling subdued all anguish to riot in the excess of my despair evil thenceforth became my good urged thus far i had no choice but to adapt my nature to an element which i had willingly chosen the completion of my demoniacal design became an insatiable passion and now it is ended there is my last victim ,Frankenstein
i was at first touched by the expressions of his misery yet when i called to mind what frankenstein had said of his powers of eloquence and persuasion and when i again cast my eyes on the lifeless form of my friend indignation was rekindled within me wretch i said it is well that you come here to whine over the desolation that you have made you throw a torch into a pile of buildings and when they are consumed you sit among the ruins and lament the fall hypocritical fiend if he whom you mourn still lived still would he be the object again would he become the prey of your accursed vengeance it is not pity that you feel you lament only because the victim of your malignity is withdrawn from your power ,Frankenstein
oh it is not thusnot thus interrupted the being yet such must be the impression conveyed to you by what appears to be the purport of my actions yet i seek not a fellow feeling in my misery no sympathy may i ever find when i first sought it it was the love of virtue the feelings of happiness and affection with which my whole being overflowed that i wished to be participated but now that virtue has become to me a shadow and that happiness and affection are turned into bitter and loathing despair in what should i seek for sympathy i am content to suffer alone while my sufferings shall endure when i die i am well satisfied that abhorrence and opprobrium should load my memory once my fancy was soothed with dreams of virtue of fame and of enjoyment once i falsely hoped to meet with beings who pardoning my outward form would love me for the excellent qualities which i was capable of unfolding i was nourished with high thoughts of honour and devotion but now crime has degraded me beneath the meanest animal no guilt no mischief no malignity no misery can be found comparable to mine when i run over the frightful catalogue of my sins i cannot believe that i am the same creature whose thoughts were once filled with sublime and transcendent visions of the beauty and the majesty of goodness but it is even so the fallen angel becomes a malignant devil yet even that enemy of god and man had friends and associates in his desolation i am alone ,Frankenstein
you who call frankenstein your friend seem to have a knowledge of my crimes and his misfortunes but in the detail which he gave you of them he could not sum up the hours and months of misery which i endured wasting in impotent passions for while i destroyed his hopes i did not satisfy my own desires they were for ever ardent and craving still i desired love and fellowship and i was still spurned was there no injustice in this am i to be thought the only criminal when all humankind sinned against me why do you not hate felix who drove his friend from his door with contumely why do you not execrate the rustic who sought to destroy the saviour of his child nay these are virtuous and immaculate beings i the miserable and the abandoned am an abortion to be spurned at and kicked and trampled on even now my blood boils at the recollection of this injustice ,Frankenstein
but it is true that i am a wretch i have murdered the lovely and the helpless i have strangled the innocent as they slept and grasped to death his throat who never injured me or any other living thing i have devoted my creator the select specimen of all that is worthy of love and admiration among men to misery i have pursued him even to that irremediable ruin there he lies white and cold in death you hate me but your abhorrence cannot equal that with which i regard myself i look on the hands which executed the deed i think on the heart in which the imagination of it was conceived and long for the moment when these hands will meet my eyes when that imagination will haunt my thoughts no more ,Frankenstein
fear not that i shall be the instrument of future mischief my work is nearly complete neither yours nor any mans death is needed to consummate the series of my being and accomplish that which must be done but it requires my own do not think that i shall be slow to perform this sacrifice i shall quit your vessel on the ice raft which brought me thither and shall seek the most northern extremity of the globe i shall collect my funeral pile and consume to ashes this miserable frame that its remains may afford no light to any curious and unhallowed wretch who would create such another as i have been i shall die i shall no longer feel the agonies which now consume me or be the prey of feelings unsatisfied yet unquenched he is dead who called me into being and when i shall be no more the very remembrance of us both will speedily vanish i shall no longer see the sun or stars or feel the winds play on my cheeks light feeling and sense will pass away and in this condition must i find my happiness some years ago when the images which this world affords first opened upon me when i felt the cheering warmth of summer and heard the rustling of the leaves and the warbling of the birds and these were all to me i should have wept to die now it is my only consolation polluted by crimes and torn by the bitterest remorse where can i find rest but in death ,Frankenstein
farewell i leave you and in you the last of humankind whom these eyes will ever behold farewell frankenstein if thou wert yet alive and yet cherished a desire of revenge against me it would be better satiated in my life than in my destruction but it was not so thou didst seek my extinction that i might not cause greater wretchedness and if yet in some mode unknown to me thou hadst not ceased to think and feel thou wouldst not desire against me a vengeance greater than that which i feel blasted as thou wert my agony was still superior to thine for the bitter sting of remorse will not cease to rankle in my wounds until death shall close them for ever ,Frankenstein

much to the authors surprise and if he may say so without additional offence considerably to his amusement he finds that his sketch of official life introductory to the scarlet letter has created an unprecedented excitement in the respectable community immediately around him it could hardly have been more violent indeed had he burned down the customhouse and quenched its last smoking ember in the blood of a certain venerable personage against whom he is supposed to cherish a peculiar malevolence as the public disapprobation would weigh very heavily on him were he conscious of deserving it the author begs leave to say that he has carefully read over the introductory pages with a purpose to alter or expunge whatever might be found amiss and to make the best reparation in his power for the atrocities of which he has been adjudged guilty but it appears to him that the only remarkable features of the sketch are its frank and genuine goodhumor and the general accuracy with which he has conveyed his sincere impressions of the characters therein described as to enmity or illfeeling of any kind personal or political he utterly disclaims such motives the sketch might perhaps have been wholly omitted without loss to the public or detriment to the book but having undertaken to write it he conceives that it could not have been done in a better or a kindlier spirit nor so far as his abilities availed with a livelier effect of truth ,The Scarlet Letter
it is a little remarkable thatthough disinclined to talk overmuch of myself and my affairs at the fireside and to my personal friendsan autobiographical impulse should twice in my life have taken possession of me in addressing the public the first time was three or four years since when i favored the readerinexcusably and for no earthly reason that either the indulgent reader or the intrusive author could imaginewith a description of my way of life in the deep quietude of an old manse and nowbecause beyond my deserts i was happy enough to find a listener or two on the former occasioni again seize the public by the button and talk of my three years experience in a customhouse the example of the famous p p clerk of this parish was never more faithfully followed the truth seems to be however that when he casts his leaves forth upon the wind the author addresses not the many who will fling aside his volume or never take it up but the few who will understand him better than most of his schoolmates or lifemates some authors indeed do far more than this and indulge themselves in such confidential depths of revelation as could fittingly be addressed only and exclusively to the one heart and mind of perfect sympathy as if the printed book thrown at large on the wide world were certain to find out the divided segment of the writers own nature and complete his circle of existence by bringing him into communion with it it is scarcely decorous however to speak all even where we speak impersonally but as thoughts are frozen and utterance benumbed unless the speaker stand in some true relation with his audience it may be pardonable to imagine that a friend a kind and apprehensive though not the closest friend is listening to our talk and then a native reserve being thawed by this genial consciousness we may prate of the circumstances that lie around us and even of ourself but still keep the inmost me behind its veil to this extent and within these limits an author methinks may be autobiographical without violating either the readers rights or his own ,The Scarlet Letter
it will be seen likewise that this customhouse sketch has a certain propriety of a kind always recognized in literature as explaining how a large portion of the following pages came into my possession and as offering proofs of the authenticity of a narrative therein contained this in facta desire to put myself in my true position as editor or very little more of the most prolix among the tales that make up my volumethis and no other is my true reason for assuming a personal relation with the public in accomplishing the main purpose it has appeared allowable by a few extra touches to give a faint representation of a mode of life not heretofore described together with some of the characters that move in it among whom the author happened to make one ,The Scarlet Letter
in my native town of salem at the head of what half a century ago in the days of old king derby was a bustling wharfbut which is now burdened with decayed wooden warehouses and exhibits few or no symptoms of commercial life except perhaps a bark or brig halfway down its melancholy length discharging hides or nearer at hand a nova scotia schooner pitching out her cargo of firewoodat the head i say of this dilapidated wharf which the tide often overflows and along which at the base and in the rear of the row of buildings the track of many languid years is seen in a border of unthrifty grasshere with a view from its front windows adown this not very enlivening prospect and thence across the harbor stands a spacious edifice of brick from the loftiest point of its roof during precisely three and a half hours of each forenoon floats or droops in breeze or calm the banner of the republic but with the thirteen stripes turned vertically instead of horizontally and thus indicating that a civil and not a military post of uncle sams government is here established its front is ornamented with a portico of half a dozen wooden pillars supporting a balcony beneath which a flight of wide granite steps descends towards the street over the entrance hovers an enormous specimen of the american eagle with outspread wings a shield before her breast and if i recollect aright a bunch of intermingled thunderbolts and barbed arrows in each claw with the customary infirmity of temper that characterizes this unhappy fowl she appears by the fierceness of her beak and eye and the general truculency of her attitude to threaten mischief to the inoffensive community and especially to warn all citizens careful of their safety against intruding on the premises which she overshadows with her wings nevertheless vixenly as she looks many people are seeking at this very moment to shelter themselves under the wing of the federal eagle imagining i presume that her bosom has all the softness and snugness of an eiderdown pillow but she has no great tenderness even in her best of moods and sooner or lateroftener soon than lateis apt to fling off her nestlings with a scratch of her claw a dab of her beak or a rankling wound from her barbed arrows ,The Scarlet Letter
the pavement round about the abovedescribed edificewhich we may as well name at once as the customhouse of the porthas grass enough growing in its chinks to show that it has not of late days been worn by any multitudinous resort of business in some months of the year however there often chances a forenoon when affairs move onward with a livelier tread such occasions might remind the elderly citizen of that period before the last war with england when salem was a port by itself not scorned as she is now by her own merchants and shipowners who permit her wharves to crumble to ruin while their ventures go to swell needlessly and imperceptibly the mighty flood of commerce at new york or boston on some such morning when three or four vessels happen to have arrived at onceusually from africa or south americaor to be on the verge of their departure thitherward there is a sound of frequent feet passing briskly up and down the granite steps here before his own wife has greeted him you may greet the seaflushed shipmaster just in port with his vessels papers under his arm in a tarnished tin box here too comes his owner cheerful or sombre gracious or in the sulks accordingly as his scheme of the now accomplished voyage has been realized in merchandise that will readily be turned to gold or has buried him under a bulk of incommodities such as nobody will care to rid him of here likewisethe germ of the wrinklebrowed grizzlybearded careworn merchantwe have the smart young clerk who gets the taste of traffic as a wolfcub does of blood and already sends adventures in his masters ships when he had better be sailing mimicboats upon a millpond another figure in the scene is the outwardbound sailor in quest of a protection or the recently arrived one pale and feeble seeking a passport to the hospital nor must we forget the captains of the rusty little schooners that bring firewood from the british provinces a roughlooking set of tarpaulins without the alertness of the yankee aspect but contributing an item of no slight importance to our decaying trade ,The Scarlet Letter
cluster all these individuals together as they sometimes were with other miscellaneous ones to diversify the group and for the time being it made the customhouse a stirring scene more frequently however on ascending the steps you would discernin the entry if it were summer time or in their appropriate rooms if wintry or inclement weathera row of venerable figures sitting in oldfashioned chairs which were tipped on their hind legs back against the wall oftentimes they were asleep but occasionally might be heard talking together in voices between speech and a snore and with that lack of energy that distinguishes the occupants of almshouses and all other human beings who depend for subsistence on charity on monopolized labor or anything else but their own independent exertions these old gentlemenseated like matthew at the receipt of customs but not very liable to be summoned thence like him for apostolic errandswere customhouse officers ,The Scarlet Letter
furthermore on the left hand as you enter the front door is a certain room or office about fifteen feet square and of a lofty height with two of its arched windows commanding a view of the aforesaid dilapidated wharf and the third looking across a narrow lane and along a portion of derby street all three give glimpses of the shops of grocers blockmakers slopsellers and shipchandlers around the doors of which are generally to be seen laughing and gossiping clusters of old salts and such other wharfrats as haunt the wapping of a seaport the room itself is cobwebbed and dingy with old paint its floor is strewn with gray sand in a fashion that has elsewhere fallen into long disuse and it is easy to conclude from the general slovenliness of the place that this is a sanctuary into which womankind with her tools of magic the broom and mop has very infrequent access in the way of furniture there is a stove with a voluminous funnel an old pine desk with a threelegged stool beside it two or three woodenbottom chairs exceedingly decrepit and infirm andnot to forget the libraryon some shelves a score or two of volumes of the acts of congress and a bulky digest of the revenue laws a tin pipe ascends through the ceiling and forms a medium of vocal communication with other parts of the edifice and here some six months agopacing from corner to corner or lounging on the longlegged stool with his elbow on the desk and his eyes wandering up and down the columns of the morning newspaperyou might have recognized honored reader the same individual who welcomed you into his cheery little study where the sunshine glimmered so pleasantly through the willow branches on the western side of the old manse but now should you go thither to seek him you would inquire in vain for the locofoco surveyor the besom of reform has swept him out of office and a worthier successor wears his dignity and pockets his emoluments ,The Scarlet Letter
this old town of salemmy native place though i have dwelt much away from it both in boyhood and maturer yearspossesses or did possess a hold on my affections the force of which i have never realized during my seasons of actual residence here indeed so far as its physical aspect is concerned with its flat unvaried surface covered chiefly with wooden houses few or none of which pretend to architectural beautyits irregularity which is neither picturesque nor quaint but only tameits long and lazy street lounging wearisomely through the whole extent of the peninsula with gallows hill and new guinea at one end and a view of the almshouse at the othersuch being the features of my native town it would be quite as reasonable to form a sentimental attachment to a disarranged checkerboard and yet though invariably happiest elsewhere there is within me a feeling for old salem which in lack of a better phrase i must be content to call affection the sentiment is probably assignable to the deep and aged roots which my family has struck into the soil it is now nearly two centuries and a quarter since the original briton the earliest emigrant of my name made his appearance in the wild and forestbordered settlement which has since become a city and here his descendants have been born and died and have mingled their earthy substance with the soil until no small portion of it must necessarily be akin to the mortal frame wherewith for a little while i walk the streets in part therefore the attachment which i speak of is the mere sensuous sympathy of dust for dust few of my countrymen can know what it is nor as frequent transplantation is perhaps better for the stock need they consider it desirable to know ,The Scarlet Letter
but the sentiment has likewise its moral quality the figure of that first ancestor invested by family tradition with a dim and dusky grandeur was present to my boyish imagination as far back as i can remember it still haunts me and induces a sort of homefeeling with the past which i scarcely claim in reference to the present phase of the town i seem to have a stronger claim to a residence here on account of this grave bearded sablecloaked and steeplecrowned progenitorwho came so early with his bible and his sword and trode the unworn street with such a stately port and made so large a figure as a man of war and peacea stronger claim than for myself whose name is seldom heard and my face hardly known he was a soldier legislator judge he was a ruler in the church he had all the puritanic traits both good and evil he was likewise a bitter persecutor as witness the quakers who have remembered him in their histories and relate an incident of his hard severity towards a woman of their sect which will last longer it is to be feared than any record of his better deeds although these were many his son too inherited the persecuting spirit and made himself so conspicuous in the martyrdom of the witches that their blood may fairly be said to have left a stain upon him so deep a stain indeed that his old dry bones in the charter street burialground must still retain it if they have not crumbled utterly to dust i know not whether these ancestors of mine bethought themselves to repent and ask pardon of heaven for their cruelties or whether they are now groaning under the heavy consequences of them in another state of being at all events i the present writer as their representative hereby take shame upon myself for their sakes and pray that any curse incurred by themas i have heard and as the dreary and unprosperous condition of the race for many a long year back would argue to existmay be now and henceforth removed ,The Scarlet Letter
doubtless however either of these stern and blackbrowed puritans would have thought it quite a sufficient retribution for his sins that after so long a lapse of years the old trunk of the family tree with so much venerable moss upon it should have borne as its topmost bough an idler like myself no aim that i have ever cherished would they recognize as laudable no success of mineif my life beyond its domestic scope had ever been brightened by successwould they deem otherwise than worthless if not positively disgraceful what is he murmurs one gray shadow of my forefathers to the other a writer of storybooks what kind of a business in lifewhat mode of glorifying god or being serviceable to mankind in his day and generationmay that be why the degenerate fellow might as well have been a fiddler such are the compliments bandied between my greatgrandsires and myself across the gulf of time and yet let them scorn me as they will strong traits of their nature have intertwined themselves with mine ,The Scarlet Letter
planted deep in the towns earliest infancy and childhood by these two earnest and energetic men the race has ever since subsisted here always too in respectability never so far as i have known disgraced by a single unworthy member but seldom or never on the other hand after the first two generations performing any memorable deed or so much as putting forward a claim to public notice gradually they have sunk almost out of sight as old houses here and there about the streets get covered halfway to the eaves by the accumulation of new soil from father to son for above a hundred years they followed the sea a grayheaded shipmaster in each generation retiring from the quarterdeck to the homestead while a boy of fourteen took the hereditary place before the mast confronting the salt spray and the gale which had blustered against his sire and grandsire the boy also in due time passed from the forecastle to the cabin spent a tempestuous manhood and returned from his worldwanderings to grow old and die and mingle his dust with the natal earth this long connection of a family with one spot as its place of birth and burial creates a kindred between the human being and the locality quite independent of any charm in the scenery or moral circumstances that surround him it is not love but instinct the new inhabitantwho came himself from a foreign land or whose father or grandfather camehas little claim to be called a salemite he has no conception of the oysterlike tenacity with which an old settler over whom his third century is creeping clings to the spot where his successive generations have been imbedded it is no matter that the place is joyless for him that he is weary of the old wooden houses the mud and dust the dead level of site and sentiment the chill east wind and the chillest of social atmospheresall these and whatever faults besides he may see or imagine are nothing to the purpose the spell survives and just as powerfully as if the natal spot were an earthly paradise so has it been in my case i felt it almost as a destiny to make salem my home so that the mould of features and cast of character which had all along been familiar hereever as one representative of the race lay down in his grave another assuming as it were his sentrymarch along the main streetmight still in my little day be seen and recognized in the old town nevertheless this very sentiment is an evidence that the connection which has become an unhealthy one should at last be severed human nature will not flourish any more than a potato if it be planted and replanted for too long a series of generations in the same wornout soil my children have had other birthplaces and so far as their fortunes may be within my control shall strike their roots into unaccustomed earth ,The Scarlet Letter
on emerging from the old manse it was chiefly this strange indolent unjoyous attachment for my native town that brought me to fill a place in uncle sams brick edifice when i might as well or better have gone somewhere else my doom was on me it was not the first time nor the second that i had gone awayas it seemed permanentlybut yet returned like the bad halfpenny or as if salem were for me the inevitable centre of the universe so one fine morning i ascended the flight of granite steps with the presidents commission in my pocket and was introduced to the corps of gentlemen who were to aid me in my weighty responsibility as chief executive officer of the customhouse ,The Scarlet Letter
i doubt greatlyor rather i do not doubt at allwhether any public functionary of the united states either in the civil or military line has ever had such a patriarchal body of veterans under his orders as myself the whereabouts of the oldest inhabitant was at once settled when i looked at them for upwards of twenty years before this epoch the independent position of the collector had kept the salem customhouse out of the whirlpool of political vicissitude which makes the tenure of office generally so fragile a soldiernew englands most distinguished soldierhe stood firmly on the pedestal of his gallant services and himself secure in the wise liberality of the successive administrations through which he had held office he had been the safety of his subordinates in many an hour of danger and heartquake general miller was radically conservative a man over whose kindly nature habit had no slight influence attaching himself strongly to familiar faces and with difficulty moved to change even when change might have brought unquestionable improvement thus on taking charge of my department i found few but aged men they were ancient seacaptains for the most part who after being tost on every sea and standing up sturdily against lifes tempestuous blasts had finally drifted into this quiet nook where with little to disturb them except the periodical terrors of a presidential election they one and all acquired a new lease of existence though by no means less liable than their fellowmen to age and infirmity they had evidently some talisman or other that kept death at bay two or three of their number as i was assured being gouty and rheumatic or perhaps bedridden never dreamed of making their appearance at the customhouse during a large part of the year but after a torpid winter would creep out into the warm sunshine of may or june go lazily about what they termed duty and at their own leisure and convenience betake themselves to bed again i must plead guilty to the charge of abbreviating the official breath of more than one of these venerable servants of the republic they were allowed on my representation to rest from their arduous labors and soon afterwardsas if their sole principle of life had been zeal for their countrys service as i verily believe it waswithdrew to a better world it is a pious consolation to me that through my interference a sufficient space was allowed them for repentance of the evil and corrupt practices into which as a matter of course every customhouse officer must be supposed to fall neither the front nor the back entrance of the customhouse opens on the road to paradise ,The Scarlet Letter
the greater part of my officers were whigs it was well for their venerable brotherhood that the new surveyor was not a politician and though a faithful democrat in principle neither received nor held his office with any reference to political services had it been otherwisehad an active politician been put into this influential post to assume the easy task of making head against a whig collector whose infirmities withheld him from the personal administration of his officehardly a man of the old corps would have drawn the breath of official life within a month after the exterminating angel had come up the customhouse steps according to the received code in such matters it would have been nothing short of duty in a politician to bring every one of those white heads under the axe of the guillotine it was plain enough to discern that the old fellows dreaded some such discourtesy at my hands it pained and at the same time amused me to behold the terrors that attended my advent to see a furrowed cheek weatherbeaten by half a century of storm turn ashy pale at the glance of so harmless an individual as myself to detect as one or another addressed me the tremor of a voice which in longpast days had been wont to bellow through a speakingtrumpet hoarsely enough to frighten boreas himself to silence they knew these excellent old persons that by all established ruleand as regarded some of them weighed by their own lack of efficiency for businessthey ought to have given place to younger men more orthodox in politics and altogether fitter than themselves to serve our common uncle i knew it too but could never quite find in my heart to act upon the knowledge much and deservedly to my own discredit therefore and considerably to the detriment of my official conscience they continued during my incumbency to creep about the wharves and loiter up and down the customhouse steps they spent a good deal of time also asleep in their accustomed corners with their chairs tilted back against the wall awaking however once or twice in a forenoon to bore one another with the several thousandth repetition of old seastories and mouldy jokes that had grown to be passwords and countersigns among them ,The Scarlet Letter
the discovery was soon made i imagine that the new surveyor had no great harm in him so with lightsome hearts and the happy consciousness of being usefully employedin their own behalf at least if not for our beloved countrythese good old gentlemen went through the various formalities of office sagaciously under their spectacles did they peep into the holds of vessels mighty was their fuss about little matters and marvellous sometimes the obtuseness that allowed greater ones to slip between their fingers whenever such a mischance occurredwhen a wagonload of valuable merchandise had been smuggled ashore at noonday perhaps and directly beneath their unsuspicious nosesnothing could exceed the vigilance and alacrity with which they proceeded to lock and doublelock and secure with tape and sealingwax all the avenues of the delinquent vessel instead of a reprimand for their previous negligence the case seemed rather to require an eulogium on their praiseworthy caution after the mischief had happened a grateful recognition of the promptitude of their zeal the moment that there was no longer any remedy ,The Scarlet Letter
unless people are more than commonly disagreeable it is my foolish habit to contract a kindness for them the better part of my companions character if it have a better part is that which usually comes uppermost in my regard and forms the type whereby i recognize the man as most of these old customhouse officers had good traits and as my position in reference to them being paternal and protective was favorable to the growth of friendly sentiments i soon grew to like them all it was pleasant in the summer forenoonswhen the fervent heat that almost liquefied the rest of the human family merely communicated a genial warmth to their halftorpid systemsit was pleasant to hear them chatting in the back entry a row of them all tipped against the wall as usual while the frozen witticisms of past generations were thawed out and came bubbling with laughter from their lips externally the jollity of aged men has much in common with the mirth of children the intellect any more than a deep sense of humor has little to do with the matter it is with both a gleam that plays upon the surface and imparts a sunny and cheery aspect alike to the green branch and gray mouldering trunk in one case however it is real sunshine in the other it more resembles the phosphorescent glow of decaying wood ,The Scarlet Letter
it would be sad injustice the reader must understand to represent all my excellent old friends as in their dotage in the first place my coadjutors were not invariably old there were men among them in their strength and prime of marked ability and energy and altogether superior to the sluggish and dependent mode of life on which their evil stars had cast them then moreover the white locks of age were sometimes found to be the thatch of an intellectual tenement in good repair but as respects the majority of my corps of veterans there will be no wrong done if i characterize them generally as a set of wearisome old souls who had gathered nothing worth preservation from their varied experience of life they seemed to have flung away all the golden grain of practical wisdom which they had enjoyed so many opportunities of harvesting and most carefully to have stored their memories with the husks they spoke with far more interest and unction of their mornings breakfast or yesterdays todays or tomorrows dinner than of the shipwreck of forty or fifty years ago and all the worlds wonders which they had witnessed with their youthful eyes ,The Scarlet Letter
the father of the customhousethe patriarch not only of this little squad of officials but i am bold to say of the respectable body of tidewaiters all over the united stateswas a certain permanent inspector he might truly be termed a legitimate son of the revenue system dyed in the wool or rather born in the purple since his sire a revolutionary colonel and formerly collector of the port had created an office for him and appointed him to fill it at a period of the early ages which few living men can now remember this inspector when i first knew him was a man of fourscore years or thereabouts and certainly one of the most wonderful specimens of wintergreen that you would be likely to discover in a lifetimes search with his florid cheek his compact figure smartly arrayed in a brightbuttoned blue coat his brisk and vigorous step and his hale and hearty aspect altogether he seemednot young indeedbut a kind of new contrivance of mother nature in the shape of man whom age and infirmity had no business to touch his voice and laugh which perpetually reechoed through the customhouse had nothing of the tremulous quaver and cackle of an old mans utterance they came strutting out of his lungs like the crow of a cock or the blast of a clarion looking at him merely as an animaland there was very little else to look athe was a most satisfactory object from the thorough healthfulness and wholesomeness of his system and his capacity at that extreme age to enjoy all or nearly all the delights which he had ever aimed at or conceived of the careless security of his life in the customhouse on a regular income and with but slight and infrequent apprehensions of removal had no doubt contributed to make time pass lightly over him the original and more potent causes however lay in the rare perfection of his animal nature the moderate proportion of intellect and the very trifling admixture of moral and spiritual ingredients these latter qualities indeed being in barely enough measure to keep the old gentleman from walking on allfours he possessed no power of thought no depth of feeling no troublesome sensibilities nothing in short but a few commonplace instincts which aided by the cheerful temper that grew inevitably out of his physical wellbeing did duty very respectably and to general acceptance in lieu of a heart he had been the husband of three wives all long since dead the father of twenty children most of whom at every age of childhood or maturity had likewise returned to dust here one would suppose might have been sorrow enough to imbue the sunniest disposition through and through with a sable tinge not so with our old inspector one brief sigh sufficed to carry off the entire burden of these dismal reminiscences the next moment he was as ready for sport as any unbreeched infant far readier than the collectors junior clerk who at nineteen years was much the elder and graver man of the two ,The Scarlet Letter
i used to watch and study this patriarchal personage with i think livelier curiosity than any other form of humanity there presented to my notice he was in truth a rare phenomenon so perfect in one point of view so shallow so delusive so impalpable such an absolute nonentity in every other my conclusion was that he had no soul no heart no mind nothing as i have already said but instincts and yet withal so cunningly had the few materials of his character been put together that there was no painful perception of deficiency but on my part an entire contentment with what i found in him it might be difficultand it was soto conceive how he should exist hereafter so earthly and sensuous did he seem but surely his existence here admitting that it was to terminate with his last breath had been not unkindly given with no higher moral responsibilities than the beasts of the field but with a larger scope of enjoyment than theirs and with all their blessed immunity from the dreariness and duskiness of age ,The Scarlet Letter
one point in which he had vastly the advantage over his fourfooted brethren was his ability to recollect the good dinners which it had made no small portion of the happiness of his life to eat his gourmandism was a highly agreeable trait and to hear him talk of roastmeat was as appetizing as a pickle or an oyster as he possessed no higher attribute and neither sacrificed nor vitiated any spiritual endowment by devoting all his energies and ingenuities to subserve the delight and profit of his maw it always pleased and satisfied me to hear him expatiate on fish poultry and butchers meat and the most eligible methods of preparing them for the table his reminiscences of good cheer however ancient the date of the actual banquet seemed to bring the savor of pig or turkey under ones very nostrils there were flavors on his palate that had lingered there not less than sixty or seventy years and were still apparently as fresh as that of the muttonchop which he had just devoured for his breakfast i have heard him smack his lips over dinners every guest at which except himself had long been food for worms it was marvellous to observe how the ghosts of bygone meals were continually rising up before him not in anger or retribution but as if grateful for his former appreciation and seeking to resuscitate an endless series of enjoyment at once shadowy and sensual a tenderloin of beef a hindquarter of veal a sparerib of pork a particular chicken or a remarkably praiseworthy turkey which had perhaps adorned his board in the days of the elder adams would be remembered while all the subsequent experience of our race and all the events that brightened or darkened his individual career had gone over him with as little permanent effect as the passing breeze the chief tragic event of the old mans life so far as i could judge was his mishap with a certain goose which lived and died some twenty or forty years ago a goose of most promising figure but which at table proved so inveterately tough that the carvingknife would make no impression on its carcass and it could only be divided with an axe and handsaw ,The Scarlet Letter
but it is time to quit this sketch on which however i should be glad to dwell at considerably more length because of all men whom i have ever known this individual was fittest to be a customhouse officer most persons owing to causes which i may not have space to hint at suffer moral detriment from this peculiar mode of life the old inspector was incapable of it and were he to continue in office to the end of time would be just as good as he was then and sit down to dinner with just as good an appetite ,The Scarlet Letter
there is one likeness without which my gallery of customhouse portraits would be strangely incomplete but which my comparatively few opportunities for observation enable me to sketch only in the merest outline it is that of the collector our gallant old general who after his brilliant military service subsequently to which he had ruled over a wild western territory had come hither twenty years before to spend the decline of his varied and honorable life the brave soldier had already numbered nearly or quite his threescore years and ten and was pursuing the remainder of his earthly march burdened with infirmities which even the martial music of his own spiritstirring recollections could do little towards lightening the step was palsied now that had been foremost in the charge it was only with the assistance of a servant and by leaning his hand heavily on the iron balustrade that he could slowly and painfully ascend the customhouse steps and with a toilsome progress across the floor attain his customary chair beside the fireplace there he used to sit gazing with a somewhat dim serenity of aspect at the figures that came and went amid the rustle of papers the administering of oaths the discussion of business and the casual talk of the office all which sounds and circumstances seemed but indistinctly to impress his senses and hardly to make their way into his inner sphere of contemplation his countenance in this repose was mild and kindly if his notice was sought an expression of courtesy and interest gleamed out upon his features proving that there was light within him and that it was only the outward medium of the intellectual lamp that obstructed the rays in their passage the closer you penetrated to the substance of his mind the sounder it appeared when no longer called upon to speak or listen either of which operations cost him an evident effort his face would briefly subside into its former not uncheerful quietude it was not painful to behold this look for though dim it had not the imbecility of decaying age the framework of his nature originally strong and massive was not yet crumbled into ruin ,The Scarlet Letter
to observe and define his character however under such disadvantages was as difficult a task as to trace out and build up anew in imagination an old fortress like ticonderoga from a view of its gray and broken ruins here and there perchance the walls may remain almost complete but elsewhere may be only a shapeless mound cumbrous with its very strength and overgrown through long years of peace and neglect with grass and alien weeds ,The Scarlet Letter
nevertheless looking at the old warrior with affectionfor slight as was the communication between us my feeling towards him like that of all bipeds and quadrupeds who knew him might not improperly be termed soi could discern the main points of his portrait it was marked with the noble and heroic qualities which showed it to be not by a mere accident but of good right that he had won a distinguished name his spirit could never i conceive have been characterized by an uneasy activity it must at any period of his life have required an impulse to set him in motion but once stirred up with obstacles to overcome and an adequate object to be attained it was not in the man to give out or fail the heat that had formerly pervaded his nature and which was not yet extinct was never of the kind that flashes and flickers in a blaze but rather a deep red glow as of iron in a furnace weight solidity firmness this was the expression of his repose even in such decay as had crept untimely over him at the period of which i speak but i could imagine even then that under some excitement which should go deeply into his consciousnessroused by a trumpetpeal loud enough to awaken all his energies that were not dead but only slumberinghe was yet capable of flinging off his infirmities like a sick mans gown dropping the staff of age to seize a battlesword and starting up once more a warrior and in so intense a moment his demeanor would have still been calm such an exhibition however was but to be pictured in fancy not to be anticipated nor desired what i saw in himas evidently as the indestructible ramparts of old ticonderoga already cited as the most appropriate similewere the features of stubborn and ponderous endurance which might well have amounted to obstinacy in his earlier days of integrity that like most of his other endowments lay in a somewhat heavy mass and was just as unmalleable and unmanageable as a ton of iron ore and of benevolence which fiercely as he led the bayonets on at chippewa or fort erie i take to be of quite as genuine a stamp as what actuates any or all the polemical philanthropists of the age he had slain men with his own hand for aught i knowcertainly they had fallen like blades of grass at the sweep of the scythe before the charge to which his spirit imparted its triumphant energybut be that as it might there was never in his heart so much cruelty as would have brushed the down off a butterflys wing i have not known the man to whose innate kindliness i would more confidently make an appeal ,The Scarlet Letter
many characteristicsand those too which contribute not the least forcibly to impart resemblance in a sketchmust have vanished or been obscured before i met the general all merely graceful attributes are usually the most evanescent nor does nature adorn the human ruin with blossoms of new beauty that have their roots and proper nutriment only in the chinks and crevices of decay as she sows wallflowers over the ruined fortress of ticonderoga still even in respect of grace and beauty there were points well worth noting a ray of humor now and then would make its way through the veil of dim obstruction and glimmer pleasantly upon our faces a trait of native elegance seldom seen in the masculine character after childhood or early youth was shown in the generals fondness for the sight and fragrance of flowers an old soldier might be supposed to prize only the bloody laurel on his brow but here was one who seemed to have a young girls appreciation of the floral tribe ,The Scarlet Letter
there beside the fireplace the brave old general used to sit while the surveyorthough seldom when it could be avoided taking upon himself the difficult task of engaging him in conversationwas fond of standing at a distance and watching his quiet and almost slumberous countenance he seemed away from us although we saw him but a few yards off remote though we passed close beside his chair unattainable though we might have stretched forth our hands and touched his own it might be that he lived a more real life within his thoughts than amid the unappropriate environment of the collectors office the evolutions of the parade the tumult of the battle the flourish of old heroic music heard thirty years beforesuch scenes and sounds perhaps were all alive before his intellectual sense meanwhile the merchants and shipmasters the spruce clerks and uncouth sailors entered and departed the bustle of this commercial and customhouse life kept up its little murmur round about him and neither with the men nor their affairs did the general appear to sustain the most distant relation he was as much out of place as an old swordnow rusty but which had flashed once in the battles front and showed still a bright gleam along its bladewould have been among the inkstands paperfolders and mahogany rulers on the deputy collectors desk ,The Scarlet Letter
there was one thing that much aided me in renewing and recreating the stalwart soldier of the niagara frontierthe man of true and simple energy it was the recollection of those memorable words of hisill try sirspoken on the very verge of a desperate and heroic enterprise and breathing the soul and spirit of new england hardihood comprehending all perils and encountering all if in our country valor were rewarded by heraldic honor this phrasewhich it seems so easy to speak but which only he with such a task of danger and glory before him has ever spokenwould be the best and fittest of all mottoes for the generals shield of arms ,The Scarlet Letter
it contributes greatly towards a mans moral and intellectual health to be brought into habits of companionship with individuals unlike himself who care little for his pursuits and whose sphere and abilities he must go out of himself to appreciate the accidents of my life have often afforded me this advantage but never with more fulness and variety than during my continuance in office there was one man especially the observation of whose character gave me a new idea of talent his gifts were emphatically those of a man of business prompt acute clearminded with an eye that saw through all perplexities and a faculty of arrangement that made them vanish as by the waving of an enchanters wand bred up from boyhood in the customhouse it was his proper field of activity and the many intricacies of business so harassing to the interloper presented themselves before him with the regularity of a perfectly comprehended system in my contemplation he stood as the ideal of his class he was indeed the customhouse in himself or at all events the mainspring that kept its variously revolving wheels in motion for in an institution like this where its officers are appointed to subserve their own profit and convenience and seldom with a leading reference to their fitness for the duty to be performed they must perforce seek elsewhere the dexterity which is not in them thus by an inevitable necessity as a magnet attracts steelfilings so did our man of business draw to himself the difficulties which everybody met with with an easy condescension and kind forbearance towards our stupiditywhich to his order of mind must have seemed little short of crimewould he forthwith by the merest touch of his finger make the incomprehensible as clear as daylight the merchants valued him not less than we his esoteric friends his integrity was perfect it was a law of nature with him rather than a choice or a principle nor can it be otherwise than the main condition of an intellect so remarkably clear and accurate as his to be honest and regular in the administration of affairs a stain on his conscience as to anything that came within the range of his vocation would trouble such a man very much in the same way though to a far greater degree that an error in the balance of an account or an inkblot on the fair page of a book of record here in a wordand it is a rare instance in my lifei had met with a person thoroughly adapted to the situation which he held ,The Scarlet Letter
such were some of the people with whom i now found myself connected i took it in good part at the hands of providence that i was thrown into a position so little akin to my past habits and set myself seriously to gather from it whatever profit was to be had after my fellowship of toil and impracticable schemes with the dreamy brethren of brook farm after living for three years within the subtile influence of an intellect like emersons after those wild free days on the assabeth indulging fantastic speculations beside our fire of fallen boughs with ellery channing after talking with thoreau about pinetrees and indian relics in his hermitage at walden after growing fastidious by sympathy with the classic refinement of hillards culture after becoming imbued with poetic sentiment at longfellows hearthstoneit was time at length that i should exercise other faculties of my nature and nourish myself with food for which i had hitherto had little appetite even the old inspector was desirable as a change of diet to a man who had known alcott i look upon it as an evidence in some measure of a system naturally well balanced and lacking no essential part of a thorough organization that with such associates to remember i could mingle at once with men of altogether different qualities and never murmur at the change ,The Scarlet Letter
literature its exertions and objects were now of little moment in my regard i cared not at this period for books they were apart from me natureexcept it were human naturethe nature that is developed in earth and sky was in one sense hidden from me and all the imaginative delight wherewith it had been spiritualized passed away out of my mind a gift a faculty if it had not departed was suspended and inanimate within me there would have been something sad unutterably dreary in all this had i not been conscious that it lay at my own option to recall whatever was valuable in the past it might be true indeed that this was a life which could not with impunity be lived too long else it might have made me permanently other than i had been without transforming me into any shape which it would be worth my while to take but i never considered it as other than a transitory life there was always a prophetic instinct a low whisper in my ear that within no long period and whenever a new change of custom should be essential to my good a change would come ,The Scarlet Letter
meanwhile there i was a surveyor of the revenue and so far as i have been able to understand as good a surveyor as need be a man of thought fancy and sensibility had he ten times the surveyors proportion of those qualities may at any time be a man of affairs if he will only choose to give himself the trouble my fellowofficers and the merchants and seacaptains with whom my official duties brought me into any manner of connection viewed me in no other light and probably knew me in no other character none of them i presume had ever read a page of my inditing or would have cared a fig the more for me if they had read them all nor would it have mended the matter in the least had those same unprofitable pages been written with a pen like that of burns or of chaucer each of whom was a customhouse officer in his day as well as i it is a good lessonthough it may often be a hard onefor a man who has dreamed of literary fame and of making for himself a rank among the worlds dignitaries by such means to step aside out of the narrow circle in which his claims are recognized and to find how utterly devoid of significance beyond that circle is all that he achieves and all he aims at i know not that i especially needed the lesson either in the way of warning or rebuke but at any rate i learned it thoroughly nor it gives me pleasure to reflect did the truth as it came home to my perception ever cost me a pang or require to be thrown off in a sigh in the way of literary talk it is true the naval officeran excellent fellow who came into office with me and went out only a little laterwould often engage me in a discussion about one or the other of his favorite topics napoleon or shakespeare the collectors junior clerk tooa young gentleman who it was whispered occasionally covered a sheet of uncle sams letterpaper with what at the distance of a few yards looked very much like poetryused now and then to speak to me of books as matters with which i might possibly be conversant this was my all of lettered intercourse and it was quite sufficient for my necessities ,The Scarlet Letter
no longer seeking nor caring that my name should be blazoned abroad on titlepages i smiled to think that it had now another kind of vogue the customhouse marker imprinted it with a stencil and black paint on pepperbags and baskets of anatto and cigarboxes and bales of all kinds of dutiable merchandise in testimony that these commodities had paid the impost and gone regularly through the office borne on such queer vehicle of fame a knowledge of my existence so far as a name conveys it was carried where it had never been before and i hope will never go again ,The Scarlet Letter
but the past was not dead once in a great while the thoughts that had seemed so vital and so active yet had been put to rest so quietly revived again one of the most remarkable occasions when the habit of bygone days awoke in me was that which brings it within the law of literary propriety to offer the public the sketch which i am now writing ,The Scarlet Letter
in the second story of the customhouse there is a large room in which the brickwork and naked rafters have never been covered with panelling and plaster the edificeoriginally projected on a scale adapted to the old commercial enterprise of the port and with an idea of subsequent prosperity destined never to be realizedcontains far more space than its occupants know what to do with this airy hall therefore over the collectors apartments remains unfinished to this day and in spite of the aged cobwebs that festoon its dusky beams appears still to await the labor of the carpenter and mason at one end of the room in a recess were a number of barrels piled one upon another containing bundles of official documents large quantities of similar rubbish lay lumbering the floor it was sorrowful to think how many days and weeks and months and years of toil had been wasted on these musty papers which were now only an encumbrance on earth and were hidden away in this forgotten corner never more to be glanced at by human eyes but then what reams of other manuscriptsfilled not with the dulness of official formalities but with the thought of inventive brains and the rich effusion of deep heartshad gone equally to oblivion and that moreover without serving a purpose in their day as these heapedup papers had andsaddest of allwithout purchasing for their writers the comfortable livelihood which the clerks of the customhouse had gained by these worthless scratchings of the pen yet not altogether worthless perhaps as materials of local history here no doubt statistics of the former commerce of salem might be discovered and memorials of her princely merchantsold king derby old billy gray old simon forrester and many another magnate in his day whose powdered head however was scarcely in the tomb before his mountain pile of wealth began to dwindle the founders of the greater part of the families which now compose the aristocracy of salem might here be traced from the petty and obscure beginnings of their traffic at periods generally much posterior to the revolution upward to what their children look upon as longestablished rank ,The Scarlet Letter
prior to the revolution there is a dearth of records the earlier documents and archives of the customhouse having probably been carried off to halifax when all the kings officials accompanied the british army in its flight from boston it has often been a matter of regret with me for going back perhaps to the days of the protectorate those papers must have contained many references to forgotten or remembered men and to antique customs which would have affected me with the same pleasure as when i used to pick up indian arrowheads in the field near the old manse ,The Scarlet Letter
but one idle and rainy day it was my fortune to make a discovery of some little interest poking and burrowing into the heapedup rubbish in the corner unfolding one and another document and reading the names of vessels that had long ago foundered at sea or rotted at the wharves and those of merchants never heard of now on change nor very readily decipherable on their mossy tombstones glancing at such matters with the saddened weary halfreluctant interest which we bestow on the corpse of dead activityand exerting my fancy sluggish with little use to raise up from these dry bones an image of the old towns brighter aspect when india was a new region and only salem knew the way thitheri chanced to lay my hand on a small package carefully done up in a piece of ancient yellow parchment this envelope had the air of an official record of some period long past when clerks engrossed their stiff and formal chirography on more substantial materials than at present there was something about it that quickened an instinctive curiosity and made me undo the faded red tape that tied up the package with the sense that a treasure would here be brought to light unbending the rigid folds of the parchment cover i found it to be a commission under the hand and seal of governor shirley in favor of one jonathan pue as surveyor of his majestys customs for the port of salem in the province of massachusetts bay i remember to have read probably in felts annals a notice of the decease of mr surveyor pue about fourscore years ago and likewise in a newspaper of recent times an account of the digging up of his remains in the little graveyard of st peters church during the renewal of that edifice nothing if i rightly call to mind was left of my respected predecessor save an imperfect skeleton and some fragments of apparel and a wig of majestic frizzle which unlike the head that it once adorned was in very satisfactory preservation but on examining the papers which the parchment commission served to envelop i found more traces of mr pues mental part and the internal operations of his head than the frizzled wig had contained of the venerable skull itself ,The Scarlet Letter
they were documents in short not official but of a private nature or at least written in his private capacity and apparently with his own hand i could account for their being included in the heap of customhouse lumber only by the fact that mr pues death had happened suddenly and that these papers which he probably kept in his official desk had never come to the knowledge of his heirs or were supposed to relate to the business of the revenue on the transfer of the archives to halifax this package proving to be of no public concern was left behind and had remained ever since unopened ,The Scarlet Letter
the ancient surveyorbeing little molested i suppose at that early day with business pertaining to his officeseems to have devoted some of his many leisure hours to researches as a local antiquarian and other inquisitions of a similar nature these supplied material for petty activity to a mind that would otherwise have been eaten up with rust a portion of his facts by the by did me good service in the preparation of the article entitled main street included in the present volume the remainder may perhaps be applied to purposes equally valuable hereafter or not impossibly may be worked up so far as they go into a regular history of salem should my veneration for the natal soil ever impel me to so pious a task meanwhile they shall be at the command of any gentleman inclined and competent to take the unprofitable labor off my hands as a final disposition i contemplate depositing them with the essex historical society ,The Scarlet Letter
but the object that most drew my attention in the mysterious package was a certain affair of fine red cloth much worn and faded there were traces about it of gold embroidery which however was greatly frayed and defaced so that none or very little of the glitter was left it had been wrought as was easy to perceive with wonderful skill of needlework and the stitch as i am assured by ladies conversant with such mysteries gives evidence of a now forgotten art not to be recovered even by the process of picking out the threads this rag of scarlet clothfor time and wear and a sacrilegious moth had reduced it to little other than a ragon careful examination assumed the shape of a letter it was the capital letter a by an accurate measurement each limb proved to be precisely three inches and a quarter in length it had been intended there could be no doubt as an ornamental article of dress but how it was to be worn or what rank honor and dignity in bypast times were signified by it was a riddle which so evanescent are the fashions of the world in these particulars i saw little hope of solving and yet it strangely interested me my eyes fastened themselves upon the old scarlet letter and would not be turned aside certainly there was some deep meaning in it most worthy of interpretation and which as it were streamed forth from the mystic symbol subtly communicating itself to my sensibilities but evading the analysis of my mind ,The Scarlet Letter
while thus perplexedand cogitating among other hypotheses whether the letter might not have been one of those decorations which the white men used to contrive in order to take the eyes of indiansi happened to place it on my breast it seemed to methe reader may smile but must not doubt my wordit seemed to me then that i experienced a sensation not altogether physical yet almost so of burning heat and as if the letter were not of red cloth but redhot iron i shuddered and involuntarily let it fall upon the floor ,The Scarlet Letter
in the absorbing contemplation of the scarlet letter i had hitherto neglected to examine a small roll of dingy paper around which it had been twisted this i now opened and had the satisfaction to find recorded by the old surveyors pen a reasonably complete explanation of the whole affair there were several foolscap sheets containing many particulars respecting the life and conversation of one hester prynne who appeared to have been rather a noteworthy personage in the view of our ancestors she had flourished during the period between the early days of massachusetts and the close of the seventeenth century aged persons alive in the time of mr surveyor pue and from whose oral testimony he had made up his narrative remembered her in their youth as a very old but not decrepit woman of a stately and solemn aspect it had been her habit from an almost immemorial date to go about the country as a kind of voluntary nurse and doing whatever miscellaneous good she might taking upon herself likewise to give advice in all matters especially those of the heart by which means as a person of such propensities inevitably must she gained from many people the reverence due to an angel but i should imagine was looked upon by others as an intruder and a nuisance prying further into the manuscript i found the record of other doings and sufferings of this singular woman for most of which the reader is referred to the story entitled the scarlet letter and it should be borne carefully in mind that the main facts of that story are authorized and authenticated by the document of mr surveyor pue the original papers together with the scarlet letter itselfa most curious relicare still in my possession and shall be freely exhibited to whomsoever induced by the great interest of the narrative may desire a sight of them i must not be understood as affirming that in the dressing up of the tale and imagining the motives and modes of passion that influenced the characters who figure in it i have invariably confined myself within the limits of the old surveyors half a dozen sheets of foolscap on the contrary i have allowed myself as to such points nearly or altogether as much license as if the facts had been entirely of my own invention what i contend for is the authenticity of the outline ,The Scarlet Letter
this incident recalled my mind in some degree to its old track there seemed to be here the groundwork of a tale it impressed me as if the ancient surveyor in his garb of a hundred years gone by and wearing his immortal wigwhich was buried with him but did not perish in the gravehad met me in the deserted chamber of the customhouse in his port was the dignity of one who had borne his majestys commission and who was therefore illuminated by a ray of the splendor that shone so dazzlingly about the throne how unlike alas the hangdog look of a republican official who as the servant of the people feels himself less than the least and below the lowest of his masters with his own ghostly hand the obscurely seen but majestic figure had imparted to me the scarlet symbol and the little roll of explanatory manuscript with his own ghostly voice he had exhorted me on the sacred consideration of my filial duty and reverence towards himwho might reasonably regard himself as my official ancestorto bring his mouldy and motheaten lucubrations before the public do this said the ghost of mr surveyor pue emphatically nodding the head that looked so imposing within its memorable wigdo this and the profit shall be all your own you will shortly need it for it is not in your days as it was in mine when a mans office was a lifelease and oftentimes an heirloom but i charge you in this matter of old mistress prynne give to your predecessors memory the credit which will be rightfully due and i said to the ghost of mr surveyor pue i will ,The Scarlet Letter
on hester prynnes story therefore i bestowed much thought it was the subject of my meditations for many an hour while pacing to and fro across my room or traversing with a hundredfold repetition the long extent from the frontdoor of the customhouse to the sideentrance and back again great were the weariness and annoyance of the old inspector and the weighers and gaugers whose slumbers were disturbed by the unmercifully lengthened tramp of my passing and returning footsteps remembering their own former habits they used to say that the surveyor was walking the quarterdeck they probably fancied that my sole objectand indeed the sole object for which a sane man could ever put himself into voluntary motionwas to get an appetite for dinner and to say the truth an appetite sharpened by the east wind that generally blew along the passage was the only valuable result of so much indefatigable exercise so little adapted is the atmosphere of a customhouse to the delicate harvest of fancy and sensibility that had i remained there through ten presidencies yet to come i doubt whether the tale of the scarlet letter would ever have been brought before the public eye my imagination was a tarnished mirror it would not reflect or only with miserable dimness the figures with which i did my best to people it the characters of the narrative would not be warmed and rendered malleable by any heat that i could kindle at my intellectual forge they would take neither the glow of passion nor the tenderness of sentiment but retained all the rigidity of dead corpses and stared me in the face with a fixed and ghastly grin of contemptuous defiance what have you to do with us that expression seemed to say the little power you might once have possessed over the tribe of unrealities is gone you have bartered it for a pittance of the public gold go then and earn your wages in short the almost torpid creatures of my own fancy twitted me with imbecility and not without fair occasion ,The Scarlet Letter
it was not merely during the three hours and a half which uncle sam claimed as his share of my daily life that this wretched numbness held possession of me it went with me on my seashore walks and rambles into the country wheneverwhich was seldom and reluctantlyi bestirred myself to seek that invigorating charm of nature which used to give me such freshness and activity of thought the moment that i stepped across the threshold of the old manse the same torpor as regarded the capacity for intellectual effort accompanied me home and weighed upon me in the chamber which i most absurdly termed my study nor did it quit me when late at night i sat in the deserted parlor lighted only by the glimmering coalfire and the moon striving to picture forth imaginary scenes which the next day might flow out on the brightening page in manyhued description ,The Scarlet Letter
if the imaginative faculty refused to act at such an hour it might well be deemed a hopeless case moonlight in a familiar room falling so white upon the carpet and showing all its figures so distinctlymaking every object so minutely visible yet so unlike a morning or noontide visibilityis a medium the most suitable for a romancewriter to get acquainted with his illusive guests there is the little domestic scenery of the wellknown apartment the chairs with each its separate individuality the centretable sustaining a workbasket a volume or two and an extinguished lamp the sofa the bookcase the picture on the wallall these details so completely seen are so spiritualized by the unusual light that they seem to lose their actual substance and become things of intellect nothing is too small or too trifling to undergo this change and acquire dignity thereby a childs shoe the doll seated in her little wicker carriage the hobbyhorsewhatever in a word has been used or played with during the day is now invested with a quality of strangeness and remoteness though still almost as vividly present as by daylight thus therefore the floor of our familiar room has become a neutral territory somewhere between the real world and fairyland where the actual and the imaginary may meet and each imbue itself with the nature of the other ghosts might enter here without affrighting us it would be too much in keeping with the scene to excite surprise were we to look about us and discover a form beloved but gone hence now sitting quietly in a streak of this magic moonshine with an aspect that would make us doubt whether it had returned from afar or had never once stirred from our fireside ,The Scarlet Letter
the somewhat dim coalfire has an essential influence in producing the effect which i would describe it throws its unobtrusive tinge throughout the room with a faint ruddiness upon the walls and ceiling and a reflected gleam from the polish of the furniture this warmer light mingles itself with the cold spirituality of the moonbeams and communicates as it were a heart and sensibilities of human tenderness to the forms which fancy summons up it converts them from snowimages into men and women glancing at the lookingglass we beholddeep within its haunted vergethe smouldering glow of the halfextinguished anthracite the white moonbeams on the floor and a repetition of all the gleam and shadow of the picture with one remove further from the actual and nearer to the imaginative then at such an hour and with this scene before him if a man sitting all alone cannot dream strange things and make them look like truth he need never try to write romances ,The Scarlet Letter
but for myself during the whole of my customhouse experience moonlight and sunshine and the glow of firelight were just alike in my regard and neither of them was of one whit more avail than the twinkle of a tallowcandle an entire class of susceptibilities and a gift connected with themof no great richness or value but the best i hadwas gone from me ,The Scarlet Letter
it is my belief however that had i attempted a different order of composition my faculties would not have been found so pointless and inefficacious i might for instance have contented myself with writing out the narratives of a veteran shipmaster one of the inspectors whom i should be most ungrateful not to mention since scarcely a day passed that he did not stir me to laughter and admiration by his marvellous gifts as a storyteller could i have preserved the picturesque force of his style and the humorous coloring which nature taught him how to throw over his descriptions the result i honestly believe would have been something new in literature or i might readily have found a more serious task it was a folly with the materiality of this daily life pressing so intrusively upon me to attempt to fling myself back into another age or to insist on creating the semblance of a world out of airy matter when at every moment the impalpable beauty of my soapbubble was broken by the rude contact of some actual circumstance the wiser effort would have been to diffuse thought and imagination through the opaque substance of today and thus to make it a bright transparency to spiritualize the burden that began to weigh so heavily to seek resolutely the true and indestructible value that lay hidden in the petty and wearisome incidents and ordinary characters with which i was now conversant the fault was mine the page of life that was spread out before me seemed dull and commonplace only because i had not fathomed its deeper import a better book than i shall ever write was there leaf after leaf presenting itself to me just as it was written out by the reality of the flitting hour and vanishing as fast as written only because my brain wanted the insight and my hand the cunning to transcribe it at some future day it may be i shall remember a few scattered fragments and broken paragraphs and write them down and find the letters turn to gold upon the page ,The Scarlet Letter
these perceptions have come too late at the instant i was only conscious that what would have been a pleasure once was now a hopeless toil there was no occasion to make much moan about this state of affairs i had ceased to be a writer of tolerably poor tales and essays and had become a tolerably good surveyor of the customs that was all but nevertheless it is anything but agreeable to be haunted by a suspicion that ones intellect is dwindling away or exhaling without your consciousness like ether out of a phial so that at every glance you find a smaller and less volatile residuum of the fact there could be no doubt and examining myself and others i was led to conclusions in reference to the effect of public office on the character not very favorable to the mode of life in question in some other form perhaps i may hereafter develop these effects suffice it here to say that a customhouse officer of long continuance can hardly be a very praiseworthy or respectable personage for many reasons one of them the tenure by which he holds his situation and another the very nature of his business whichthough i trust an honest oneis of such a sort that he does not share in the united effort of mankind ,The Scarlet Letter
an effectwhich i believe to be observable more or less in every individual who has occupied the positionis that while he leans on the mighty arm of the republic his own proper strength departs from him he loses in an extent proportioned to the weakness or force of his original nature the capability of selfsupport if he possess an unusual share of native energy or the enervating magic of place do not operate too long upon him his forfeited powers may be redeemable the ejected officerfortunate in the unkindly shove that sends him forth betimes to struggle amid a struggling worldmay return to himself and become all that he has ever been but this seldom happens he usually keeps his ground just long enough for his own ruin and is then thrust out with sinews all unstrung to totter along the difficult footpath of life as he best may conscious of his own infirmitythat his tempered steel and elasticity are losthe forever afterwards looks wistfully about him in quest of support external to himself his pervading and continual hopea hallucination which in the face of all discouragement and making light of impossibilities haunts him while he lives and i fancy like the convulsive throes of the cholera torments him for a brief space after deathis that finally and in no long time by some happy coincidence of circumstances he shall be restored to office this faith more than anything else steals the pith and availability out of whatever enterprise he may dream of undertaking why should he toil and moil and be at so much trouble to pick himself up out of the mud when in a little while hence the strong arm of his uncle will raise and support him why should he work for his living here or go to dig gold in california when he is so soon to be made happy at monthly intervals with a little pile of glittering coin out of his uncles pocket it is sadly curious to observe how slight a taste of office suffices to infect a poor fellow with this singular disease uncle sams goldmeaning no disrespect to the worthy old gentlemanhas in this respect a quality of enchantment like that of the devils wages whoever touches it should look well to himself or he may find the bargain to go hard against him involving if not his soul yet many of its better attributes its sturdy force its courage and constancy its truth its selfreliance and all that gives the emphasis to manly character ,The Scarlet Letter
here was a fine prospect in the distance not that the surveyor brought the lesson home to himself or admitted that he could be so utterly undone either by continuance in office or ejectment yet my reflections were not the most comfortable i began to grow melancholy and restless continually prying into my mind to discover which of its poor properties were gone and what degree of detriment had already accrued to the remainder i endeavored to calculate how much longer i could stay in the customhouse and yet go forth a man to confess the truth it was my greatest apprehensionas it would never be a measure of policy to turn out so quiet an individual as myself and it being hardly in the nature of a public officer to resignit was my chief trouble therefore that i was likely to grow gray and decrepit in the surveyorship and become much such another animal as the old inspector might it not in the tedious lapse of official life that lay before me finally be with me as it was with this venerable friendto make the dinnerhour the nucleus of the day and to spend the rest of it as an old dog spends it asleep in the sunshine or in the shade a dreary lookforward this for a man who felt it to be the best definition of happiness to live throughout the whole range of his faculties and sensibilities but all this while i was giving myself very unnecessary alarm providence had meditated better things for me than i could possibly imagine for myself ,The Scarlet Letter
a remarkable event of the third year of my surveyorshipto adopt the tone of p pwas the election of general taylor to the presidency it is essential in order to form a complete estimate of the advantages of official life to view the incumbent at the incoming of a hostile administration his position is then one of the most singularly irksome and in every contingency disagreeable that a wretched mortal can possibly occupy with seldom an alternative of good on either hand although what presents itself to him as the worst event may very probably be the best but it is a strange experience to a man of pride and sensibility to know that his interests are within the control of individuals who neither love nor understand him and by whom since one or the other must needs happen he would rather be injured than obliged strange too for one who has kept his calmness throughout the contest to observe the bloodthirstiness that is developed in the hour of triumph and to be conscious that he is himself among its objects there are few uglier traits of human nature than this tendencywhich i now witnessed in men no worse than their neighborsto grow cruel merely because they possessed the power of inflicting harm if the guillotine as applied to officeholders were a literal fact instead of one of the most apt of metaphors it is my sincere belief that the active members of the victorious party were sufficiently excited to have chopped off all our heads and have thanked heaven for the opportunity it appears to mewho have been a calm and curious observer as well in victory as defeatthat this fierce and bitter spirit of malice and revenge has never distinguished the many triumphs of my own party as it now did that of the whigs the democrats take the offices as a general rule because they need them and because the practice of many years has made it the law of political warfare which unless a different system be proclaimed it were weakness and cowardice to murmur at but the long habit of victory has made them generous they know how to spare when they see occasion and when they strike the axe may be sharp indeed but its edge is seldom poisoned with illwill nor is it their custom ignominiously to kick the head which they have just struck off ,The Scarlet Letter
in short unpleasant as was my predicament at best i saw much reason to congratulate myself that i was on the losing side rather than the triumphant one if heretofore i had been none of the warmest of partisans i began now at this season of peril and adversity to be pretty acutely sensible with which party my predilections lay nor was it without something like regret and shame that according to a reasonable calculation of chances i saw my own prospect of retaining office to be better than those of my democratic brethren but who can see an inch into futurity beyond his nose my own head was the first that fell ,The Scarlet Letter
the moment when a mans head drops off is seldom or never i am inclined to think precisely the most agreeable of his life nevertheless like the greater part of our misfortunes even so serious a contingency brings its remedy and consolation with it if the sufferer will but make the best rather than the worst of the accident which has befallen him in my particular case the consolatory topics were close at hand and indeed had suggested themselves to my meditations a considerable time before it was requisite to use them in view of my previous weariness of office and vague thoughts of resignation my fortune somewhat resembled that of a person who should entertain an idea of committing suicide and although beyond his hopes meet with the good hap to be murdered in the customhouse as before in the old manse i had spent three years a term long enough to rest a weary brain long enough to break off old intellectual habits and make room for new ones long enough and too long to have lived in an unnatural state doing what was really of no advantage nor delight to any human being and withholding myself from toil that would at least have stilled an unquiet impulse in me then moreover as regarded his unceremonious ejectment the late surveyor was not altogether illpleased to be recognized by the whigs as an enemy since his inactivity in political affairshis tendency to roam at will in that broad and quiet field where all mankind may meet rather than confine himself to those narrow paths where brethren of the same household must diverge from one anotherhad sometimes made it questionable with his brother democrats whether he was a friend now after he had won the crown of martyrdom though with no longer a head to wear it on the point might be looked upon as settled finally little heroic as he was it seemed more decorous to be overthrown in the downfall of the party with which he had been content to stand than to remain a forlorn survivor when so many worthier men were falling and at last after subsisting for four years on the mercy of a hostile administration to be compelled then to define his position anew and claim the yet more humiliating mercy of a friendly one ,The Scarlet Letter
meanwhile the press had taken up my affair and kept me for a week or two careering through the public prints in my decapitated state like irvings headless horseman ghastly and grim and longing to be buried as a politically dead man ought so much for my figurative self the real human being all this time with his head safely on his shoulders had brought himself to the comfortable conclusion that everything was for the best and making an investment in ink paper and steelpens had opened his longdisused writingdesk and was again a literary man ,The Scarlet Letter
now it was that the lucubrations of my ancient predecessor mr surveyor pue came into play rusty through long idleness some little space was requisite before my intellectual machinery could be brought to work upon the tale with an effect in any degree satisfactory even yet though my thoughts were ultimately much absorbed in the task it wears to my eye a stern and sombre aspect too much ungladdened by genial sunshine too little relieved by the tender and familiar influences which soften almost every scene of nature and real life and undoubtedly should soften every picture of them this uncaptivating effect is perhaps due to the period of hardly accomplished revolution and still seething turmoil in which the story shaped itself it is no indication however of a lack of cheerfulness in the writers mind for he was happier while straying through the gloom of these sunless fantasies than at any time since he had quitted the old manse some of the briefer articles which contribute to make up the volume have likewise been written since my involuntary withdrawal from the toils and honors of public life and the remainder are gleaned from annuals and magazines of such antique date that they have gone round the circle and come back to novelty again keeping up the metaphor of the political guillotine the whole may be considered as the posthumous papers of a decapitated surveyor and the sketch which i am now bringing to a close if too autobiographical for a modest person to publish in his lifetime will readily be excused in a gentleman who writes from beyond the grave peace be with all the world my blessing on my friends my forgiveness to my enemies for i am in the realm of quiet ,The Scarlet Letter
footnote  at the time of writing this article the author intended to publish along with the scarlet letter several shorter tales and sketches these it has been thought advisable to defer ,The Scarlet Letter
the life of the customhouse lies like a dream behind me the old inspectorwho by the by i regret to say was overthrown and killed by a horse some time ago else he would certainly have lived foreverhe and all those other venerable personages who sat with him at the receipt of custom are but shadows in my view whiteheaded and wrinkled images which my fancy used to sport with and has now flung aside forever the merchantspingree phillips shepard upton kimball bertram huntthese and many other names which had such a classic familiarity for my ear six months agothese men of traffic who seemed to occupy so important a position in the worldhow little time has it required to disconnect me from them all not merely in act but recollection it is with an effort that i recall the figures and appellations of these few soon likewise my old native town will loom upon me through the haze of memory a mist brooding over and around it as if it were no portion of the real earth but an overgrown village in cloudland with only imaginary inhabitants to people its wooden houses and walk its homely lanes and the unpicturesque prolixity of its main street henceforth it ceases to be a reality of my life i am a citizen of somewhere else my good townspeople will not much regret me forthough it has been as dear an object as any in my literary efforts to be of some importance in their eyes and to win myself a pleasant memory in this abode and burialplace of so many of my forefathersthere has never been for me the genial atmosphere which a literary man requires in order to ripen the best harvest of his mind i shall do better amongst other faces and these familiar ones it need hardly be said will do just as well without me ,The Scarlet Letter
it may be howevero transporting and triumphant thoughtthat the greatgrandchildren of the present race may sometimes think kindly of the scribbler of bygone days when the antiquary of days to come among the sites memorable in the towns history shall point out the locality of the town pump ,The Scarlet Letter
a throng of bearded men in sadcolored garments and gray steeplecrowned hats intermixed with women some wearing hoods and others bareheaded was assembled in front of a wooden edifice the door of which was heavily timbered with oak and studded with iron spikes ,The Scarlet Letter
the founders of a new colony whatever utopia of human virtue and happiness they might originally project have invariably recognized it among their earliest practical necessities to allot a portion of the virgin soil as a cemetery and another portion as the site of a prison in accordance with this rule it may safely be assumed that the forefathers of boston had built the first prisonhouse somewhere in the vicinity of cornhill almost as seasonably as they marked out the first burialground on isaac johnsons lot and round about his grave which subsequently became the nucleus of all the congregated sepulchres in the old churchyard of kings chapel certain it is that some fifteen or twenty years after the settlement of the town the wooden jail was already marked with weatherstains and other indications of age which gave a yet darker aspect to its beetlebrowed and gloomy front the rust on the ponderous ironwork of its oaken door looked more antique than anything else in the new world like all that pertains to crime it seemed never to have known a youthful era before this ugly edifice and between it and the wheeltrack of the street was a grassplot much overgrown with burdock pigweed appleperu and such unsightly vegetation which evidently found something congenial in the soil that had so early borne the black flower of civilized society a prison but on one side of the portal and rooted almost at the threshold was a wild rosebush covered in this month of june with its delicate gems which might be imagined to offer their fragrance and fragile beauty to the prisoner as he went in and to the condemned criminal as he came forth to his doom in token that the deep heart of nature could pity and be kind to him ,The Scarlet Letter
this rosebush by a strange chance has been kept alive in history but whether it had merely survived out of the stern old wilderness so long after the fall of the gigantic pines and oaks that originally overshadowed itor whether as there is fair authority for believing it had sprung up under the footsteps of the sainted ann hutchinson as she entered the prisondoorwe shall not take upon us to determine finding it so directly on the threshold of our narrative which is now about to issue from that inauspicious portal we could hardly do otherwise than pluck one of its flowers and present it to the reader it may serve let us hope to symbolize some sweet moral blossom that may be found along the track or relieve the darkening close of a tale of human frailty and sorrow ,The Scarlet Letter
the grassplot before the jail in prison lane on a certain summer morning not less than two centuries ago was occupied by a pretty large number of the inhabitants of boston all with their eyes intently fastened on the ironclamped oaken door amongst any other population or at a later period in the history of new england the grim rigidity that petrified the bearded physiognomies of these good people would have augured some awful business in hand it could have betokened nothing short of the anticipated execution of some noted culprit on whom the sentence of a legal tribunal had but confirmed the verdict of public sentiment but in that early severity of the puritan character an inference of this kind could not so indubitably be drawn it might be that a sluggish bondservant or an undutiful child whom his parents had given over to the civil authority was to be corrected at the whippingpost it might be that an antinomian a quaker or other heterodox religionist was to be scourged out of the town or an idle and vagrant indian whom the white mans firewater had made riotous about the streets was to be driven with stripes into the shadow of the forest it might be too that a witch like old mistress hibbins the bittertempered widow of the magistrate was to die upon the gallows in either case there was very much the same solemnity of demeanor on the part of the spectators as befitted a people amongst whom religion and law were almost identical and in whose character both were so thoroughly interfused that the mildest and the severest acts of public discipline were alike made venerable and awful meagre indeed and cold was the sympathy that a transgressor might look for from such bystanders at the scaffold on the other hand a penalty which in our days would infer a degree of mocking infamy and ridicule might then be invested with almost as stern a dignity as the punishment of death itself ,The Scarlet Letter
it was a circumstance to be noted on the summer morning when our story begins its course that the women of whom there were several in the crowd appeared to take a peculiar interest in whatever penal infliction might be expected to ensue the age had not so much refinement that any sense of impropriety restrained the wearers of petticoat and farthingale from stepping forth into the public ways and wedging their not unsubstantial persons if occasion were into the throng nearest to the scaffold at an execution morally as well as materially there was a coarser fibre in those wives and maidens of old english birth and breeding than in their fair descendants separated from them by a series of six or seven generations for throughout that chain of ancestry every successive mother has transmitted to her child a fainter bloom a more delicate and briefer beauty and a slighter physical frame if not a character of less force and solidity than her own the women who were now standing about the prisondoor stood within less than half a century of the period when the manlike elizabeth had been the not altogether unsuitable representative of the sex they were her countrywomen and the beef and ale of their native land with a moral diet not a whit more refined entered largely into their composition the bright morning sun therefore shone on broad shoulders and welldeveloped busts and on round and ruddy cheeks that had ripened in the faroff island and had hardly yet grown paler or thinner in the atmosphere of new england there was moreover a boldness and rotundity of speech among these matrons as most of them seemed to be that would startle us at the present day whether in respect to its purport or its volume of tone ,The Scarlet Letter
goodwives said a hardfeatured dame of fifty ill tell ye a piece of my mind it would be greatly for the public behoof if we women being of mature age and churchmembers in good repute should have the handling of such malefactresses as this hester prynne what think ye gossips if the hussy stood up for judgment before us five that are now here in a knot together would she come off with such a sentence as the worshipful magistrates have awarded marry i trow not ,The Scarlet Letter
the magistrates are godfearing gentlemen but merciful overmuchthat is a truth added a third autumnal matron at the very least they should have put the brand of a hot iron on hester prynnes forehead madam hester would have winced at that i warrant me but shethe naughty baggagelittle will she care what they put upon the bodice of her gown why look you she may cover it with a brooch or such like heathenish adornment and so walk the streets as brave as ever ,The Scarlet Letter
what do we talk of marks and brands whether on the bodice of her gown or the flesh of her forehead cried another female the ugliest as well as the most pitiless of these selfconstituted judges this woman has brought shame upon us all and ought to die is there not law for it truly there is both in the scripture and the statutebook then let the magistrates who have made it of no effect thank themselves if their own wives and daughters go astray ,The Scarlet Letter
mercy on us goodwife exclaimed a man in the crowd is there no virtue in woman save what springs from a wholesome fear of the gallows that is the hardest word yet hush now gossips for the lock is turning in the prisondoor and here comes mistress prynne herself ,The Scarlet Letter
the door of the jail being flung open from within there appeared in the first place like a black shadow emerging into sunshine the grim and grisly presence of the townbeadle with a sword by his side and his staff of office in his hand this personage prefigured and represented in his aspect the whole dismal severity of the puritanic code of law which it was his business to administer in its final and closest application to the offender stretching forth the official staff in his left hand he laid his right upon the shoulder of a young woman whom he thus drew forward until on the threshold of the prisondoor she repelled him by an action marked with natural dignity and force of character and stepped into the open air as if by her own free will she bore in her arms a child a baby of some three months old who winked and turned aside its little face from the too vivid light of day because its existence heretofore had brought it acquainted only with the gray twilight of a dungeon or other darksome apartment of the prison ,The Scarlet Letter
when the young womanthe mother of this childstood fully revealed before the crowd it seemed to be her first impulse to clasp the infant closely to her bosom not so much by an impulse of motherly affection as that she might thereby conceal a certain token which was wrought or fastened into her dress in a moment however wisely judging that one token of her shame would but poorly serve to hide another she took the baby on her arm and with a burning blush and yet a haughty smile and a glance that would not be abashed looked around at her townspeople and neighbors on the breast of her gown in fine red cloth surrounded with an elaborate embroidery and fantastic flourishes of goldthread appeared the letter a it was so artistically done and with so much fertility and gorgeous luxuriance of fancy that it had all the effect of a last and fitting decoration to the apparel which she wore and which was of a splendor in accordance with the taste of the age but greatly beyond what was allowed by the sumptuary regulations of the colony ,The Scarlet Letter
the young woman was tall with a figure of perfect elegance on a large scale she had dark and abundant hair so glossy that it threw off the sunshine with a gleam and a face which besides being beautiful from regularity of feature and richness of complexion had the impressiveness belonging to a marked brow and deep black eyes she was ladylike too after the manner of the feminine gentility of those days characterized by a certain state and dignity rather than by the delicate evanescent and indescribable grace which is now recognized as its indication and never had hester prynne appeared more ladylike in the antique interpretation of the term than as she issued from the prison those who had before known her and had expected to behold her dimmed and obscured by a disastrous cloud were astonished and even startled to perceive how her beauty shone out and made a halo of the misfortune and ignominy in which she was enveloped it may be true that to a sensitive observer there was something exquisitely painful in it her attire which indeed she had wrought for the occasion in prison and had modelled much after her own fancy seemed to express the attitude of her spirit the desperate recklessness of her mood by its wild and picturesque peculiarity but the point which drew all eyes and as it were transfigured the wearerso that both men and women who had been familiarly acquainted with hester prynne were now impressed as if they beheld her for the first timewas that scarlet letter so fantastically embroidered and illuminated upon her bosom it had the effect of a spell taking her out of the ordinary relations with humanity and enclosing her in a sphere by herself ,The Scarlet Letter
she hath good skill at her needle thats certain remarked one of her female spectators but did ever a woman before this brazen hussy contrive such a way of showing it why gossips what is it but to laugh in the faces of our godly magistrates and make a pride out of what they worthy gentlemen meant for a punishment ,The Scarlet Letter
it were well muttered the most ironvisaged of the old dames if we stripped madam hesters rich gown off her dainty shoulders and as for the red letter which she hath stitched so curiously ill bestow a rag of mine own rheumatic flannel to make a fitter one ,The Scarlet Letter
make way good people make way in the kings name cried he open a passage and i promise ye mistress prynne shall be set where man woman and child may have a fair sight of her brave apparel from this time till an hour past meridian a blessing on the righteous colony of the massachusetts where iniquity is dragged out into the sunshine come along madam hester and show your scarlet letter in the marketplace ,The Scarlet Letter
a lane was forthwith opened through the crowd of spectators preceded by the beadle and attended by an irregular procession of sternbrowed men and unkindly visaged women hester prynne set forth towards the place appointed for her punishment a crowd of eager and curious schoolboys understanding little of the matter in hand except that it gave them a halfholiday ran before her progress turning their heads continually to stare into her face and at the winking baby in her arms and at the ignominious letter on her breast it was no great distance in those days from the prisondoor to the marketplace measured by the prisoners experience however it might be reckoned a journey of some length for haughty as her demeanor was she perchance underwent an agony from every footstep of those that thronged to see her as if her heart had been flung into the street for them all to spurn and trample upon in our nature however there is a provision alike marvellous and merciful that the sufferer should never know the intensity of what he endures by its present torture but chiefly by the pang that rankles after it with almost a serene deportment therefore hester prynne passed through this portion of her ordeal and came to a sort of scaffold at the western extremity of the marketplace it stood nearly beneath the eaves of bostons earliest church and appeared to be a fixture there ,The Scarlet Letter
in fact this scaffold constituted a portion of a penal machine which now for two or three generations past has been merely historical and traditionary among us but was held in the old time to be as effectual an agent in the promotion of good citizenship as ever was the guillotine among the terrorists of france it was in short the platform of the pillory and above it rose the framework of that instrument of discipline so fashioned as to confine the human head in its tight grasp and thus hold it up to the public gaze the very ideal of ignominy was embodied and made manifest in this contrivance of wood and iron there can be no outrage methinks against our common naturewhatever be the delinquencies of the individualno outrage more flagrant than to forbid the culprit to hide his face for shame as it was the essence of this punishment to do in hester prynnes instance however as not unfrequently in other cases her sentence bore that she should stand a certain time upon the platform but without undergoing that gripe about the neck and confinement of the head the proneness to which was the most devilish characteristic of this ugly engine knowing well her part she ascended a flight of wooden steps and was thus displayed to the surrounding multitude at about the height of a mans shoulders above the street ,The Scarlet Letter
had there been a papist among the crowd of puritans he might have seen in this beautiful woman so picturesque in her attire and mien and with the infant at her bosom an object to remind him of the image of divine maternity which so many illustrious painters have vied with one another to represent something which should remind him indeed but only by contrast of that sacred image of sinless motherhood whose infant was to redeem the world here there was the taint of deepest sin in the most sacred quality of human life working such effect that the world was only the darker for this womans beauty and the more lost for the infant that she had borne ,The Scarlet Letter
the scene was not without a mixture of awe such as must always invest the spectacle of guilt and shame in a fellowcreature before society shall have grown corrupt enough to smile instead of shuddering at it the witnesses of hester prynnes disgrace had not yet passed beyond their simplicity they were stern enough to look upon her death had that been the sentence without a murmur at its severity but had none of the heartlessness of another social state which would find only a theme for jest in an exhibition like the present even had there been a disposition to turn the matter into ridicule it must have been repressed and overpowered by the solemn presence of men no less dignified than the governor and several of his counsellors a judge a general and the ministers of the town all of whom sat or stood in a balcony of the meetinghouse looking down upon the platform when such personages could constitute a part of the spectacle without risking the majesty or reverence of rank and office it was safely to be inferred that the infliction of a legal sentence would have an earnest and effectual meaning accordingly the crowd was sombre and grave the unhappy culprit sustained herself as best a woman might under the heavy weight of a thousand unrelenting eyes all fastened upon her and concentrated at her bosom it was almost intolerable to be borne of an impulsive and passionate nature she had fortified herself to encounter the stings and venomous stabs of public contumely wreaking itself in every variety of insult but there was a quality so much more terrible in the solemn mood of the popular mind that she longed rather to behold all those rigid countenances contorted with scornful merriment and herself the object had a roar of laughter burst from the multitudeeach man each woman each little shrillvoiced child contributing their individual partshester prynne might have repaid them all with a bitter and disdainful smile but under the leaden infliction which it was her doom to endure she felt at moments as if she must needs shriek out with the full power of her lungs and cast herself from the scaffold down upon the ground or else go mad at once ,The Scarlet Letter
yet there were intervals when the whole scene in which she was the most conspicuous object seemed to vanish from her eyes or at least glimmered indistinctly before them like a mass of imperfectly shaped and spectral images her mind and especially her memory was preternaturally active and kept bringing up other scenes than this roughly hewn street of a little town on the edge of the western wilderness other faces than were lowering upon her from beneath the brims of those steeplecrowned hats reminiscences the most trifling and immaterial passages of infancy and schooldays sports childish quarrels and the little domestic traits of her maiden years came swarming back upon her intermingled with recollections of whatever was gravest in her subsequent life one picture precisely as vivid as another as if all were of similar importance or all alike a play possibly it was an instinctive device of her spirit to relieve itself by the exhibition of these phantasmagoric forms from the cruel weight and hardness of the reality ,The Scarlet Letter
be that as it might the scaffold of the pillory was a point of view that revealed to hester prynne the entire track along which she had been treading since her happy infancy standing on that miserable eminence she saw again her native village in old england and her paternal home a decayed house of gray stone with a povertystricken aspect but retaining a halfobliterated shield of arms over the portal in token of antique gentility she saw her fathers face with its bald brow and reverend white beard that flowed over the oldfashioned elizabethan ruff her mothers too with the look of heedful and anxious love which it always wore in her remembrance and which even since her death had so often laid the impediment of a gentle remonstrance in her daughters pathway she saw her own face glowing with girlish beauty and illuminating all the interior of the dusky mirror in which she had been wont to gaze at it there she beheld another countenance of a man well stricken in years a pale thin scholarlike visage with eyes dim and bleared by the lamplight that had served them to pore over many ponderous books yet those same bleared optics had a strange penetrating power when it was their owners purpose to read the human soul this figure of the study and the cloister as hester prynnes womanly fancy failed not to recall was slightly deformed with the left shoulder a trifle higher than the right next rose before her in memorys picturegallery the intricate and narrow thoroughfares the tall gray houses the huge cathedrals and the public edifices ancient in date and quaint in architecture of a continental city where a new life had awaited her still in connection with the misshapen scholar a new life but feeding itself on timeworn materials like a tuft of green moss on a crumbling wall lastly in lieu of these shifting scenes came back the rude marketplace of the puritan settlement with all the townspeople assembled and levelling their stern regards at hester prynneyes at herselfwho stood on the scaffold of the pillory an infant on her arm and the letter a in scarlet fantastically embroidered with goldthread upon her bosom ,The Scarlet Letter
could it be true she clutched the child so fiercely to her breast that it sent forth a cry she turned her eyes downward at the scarlet letter and even touched it with her finger to assure herself that the infant and the shame were real yesthese were her realitiesall else had vanished ,The Scarlet Letter
from this intense consciousness of being the object of severe and universal observation the wearer of the scarlet letter was at length relieved by discerning on the outskirts of the crowd a figure which irresistibly took possession of her thoughts an indian in his native garb was standing there but the red men were not so infrequent visitors of the english settlements that one of them would have attracted any notice from hester prynne at such a time much less would he have excluded all other objects and ideas from her mind by the indians side and evidently sustaining a companionship with him stood a white man clad in a strange disarray of civilized and savage costume ,The Scarlet Letter
he was small in stature with a furrowed visage which as yet could hardly be termed aged there was a remarkable intelligence in his features as of a person who had so cultivated his mental part that it could not fail to mould the physical to itself and become manifest by unmistakable tokens although by a seemingly careless arrangement of his heterogeneous garb he had endeavored to conceal or abate the peculiarity it was sufficiently evident to hester prynne that one of this mans shoulders rose higher than the other again at the first instant of perceiving that thin visage and the slight deformity of the figure she pressed her infant to her bosom with so convulsive a force that the poor babe uttered another cry of pain but the mother did not seem to hear it ,The Scarlet Letter
at his arrival in the marketplace and some time before she saw him the stranger had bent his eyes on hester prynne it was carelessly at first like a man chiefly accustomed to look inward and to whom external matters are of little value and import unless they bear relation to something within his mind very soon however his look became keen and penetrative a writhing horror twisted itself across his features like a snake gliding swiftly over them and making one little pause with all its wreathed intervolutions in open sight his face darkened with some powerful emotion which nevertheless he so instantaneously controlled by an effort of his will that save at a single moment its expression might have passed for calmness after a brief space the convulsion grew almost imperceptible and finally subsided into the depths of his nature when he found the eyes of hester prynne fastened on his own and saw that she appeared to recognize him he slowly and calmly raised his finger made a gesture with it in the air and laid it on his lips ,The Scarlet Letter
you must needs be a stranger in this region friend answered the townsman looking curiously at the questioner and his savage companion else you would surely have heard of mistress hester prynne and her evil doings she hath raised a great scandal i promise you in godly master dimmesdales church ,The Scarlet Letter
you say truly replied the other i am a stranger and have been a wanderer sorely against my will i have met with grievous mishaps by sea and land and have been long held in bonds among the heathenfolk to the southward and am now brought hither by this indian to be redeemed out of my captivity will it please you therefore to tell me of hester prynneshave i her name rightlyof this womans offences and what has brought her to yonder scaffold ,The Scarlet Letter
truly friend and methinks it must gladden your heart after your troubles and sojourn in the wilderness said the townsman to find yourself at length in a land where iniquity is searched out and punished in the sight of rulers and people as here in our godly new england yonder woman sir you must know was the wife of a certain learned man english by birth but who had long dwelt in amsterdam whence some good time agone he was minded to cross over and cast in his lot with us of the massachusetts to this purpose he sent his wife before him remaining himself to look after some necessary affairs marry good sir in some two years or less that the woman has been a dweller here in boston no tidings have come of this learned gentleman master prynne and his young wife look you being left to her own misguidance ,The Scarlet Letter
ahahai conceive you said the stranger with a bitter smile so learned a man as you speak of should have learned this too in his books and who by your favor sir may be the father of yonder babeit is some three or four months old i should judgewhich mistress prynne is holding in her arms ,The Scarlet Letter
of a truth friend that matter remaineth a riddle and the daniel who shall expound it is yet awanting answered the townsman madam hester absolutely refuseth to speak and the magistrates have laid their heads together in vain peradventure the guilty one stands looking on at this sad spectacle unknown of man and forgetting that god sees him ,The Scarlet Letter
it behooves him well if he be still in life responded the townsman now good sir our massachusetts magistracy bethinking themselves that this woman is youthful and fair and doubtless was strongly tempted to her falland that moreover as is most likely her husband may be at the bottom of the seathey have not been bold to put in force the extremity of our righteous law against her the penalty thereof is death but in their great mercy and tenderness of heart they have doomed mistress prynne to stand only a space of three hours on the platform of the pillory and then and thereafter for the remainder of her natural life to wear a mark of shame upon her bosom ,The Scarlet Letter
a wise sentence remarked the stranger gravely bowing his head thus she will be a living sermon against sin until the ignominious letter be engraved upon her tombstone it irks me nevertheless that the partner of her iniquity should not at least stand on the scaffold by her side but he will be knownhe will be knownhe will be known ,The Scarlet Letter
while this passed hester prynne had been standing on her pedestal still with a fixed gaze towards the stranger so fixed a gaze that at moments of intense absorption all other objects in the visible world seemed to vanish leaving only him and her such an interview perhaps would have been more terrible than even to meet him as she now did with the hot midday sun burning down upon her face and lighting up its shame with the scarlet token of infamy on her breast with the sinborn infant in her arms with a whole people drawn forth as to a festival staring at the features that should have been seen only in the quiet gleam of the fireside in the happy shadow of a home or beneath a matronly veil at church dreadful as it was she was conscious of a shelter in the presence of these thousand witnesses it was better to stand thus with so many betwixt him and her than to greet him face to face they two alone she fled for refuge as it were to the public exposure and dreaded the moment when its protection should be withdrawn from her involved in these thoughts she scarcely heard a voice behind her until it had repeated her name more than once in a loud and solemn tone audible to the whole multitude ,The Scarlet Letter
it has already been noticed that directly over the platform on which hester prynne stood was a kind of balcony or open gallery appended to the meetinghouse it was the place whence proclamations were wont to be made amidst an assemblage of the magistracy with all the ceremonial that attended such public observances in those days here to witness the scene which we are describing sat governor bellingham himself with four sergeants about his chair bearing halberds as a guard of honor he wore a dark feather in his hat a border of embroidery on his cloak and a black velvet tunic beneath a gentleman advanced in years with a hard experience written in his wrinkles he was not ill fitted to be the head and representative of a community which owed its origin and progress and its present state of development not to the impulses of youth but to the stern and tempered energies of manhood and the sombre sagacity of age accomplishing so much precisely because it imagined and hoped so little the other eminent characters by whom the chief ruler was surrounded were distinguished by a dignity of mien belonging to a period when the forms of authority were felt to possess the sacredness of divine institutions they were doubtless good men just and sage but out of the whole human family it would not have been easy to select the same number of wise and virtuous persons who should be less capable of sitting in judgment on an erring womans heart and disentangling its mesh of good and evil than the sages of rigid aspect towards whom hester prynne now turned her face she seemed conscious indeed that whatever sympathy she might expect lay in the larger and warmer heart of the multitude for as she lifted her eyes towards the balcony the unhappy woman grew pale and trembled ,The Scarlet Letter
the voice which had called her attention was that of the reverend and famous john wilson the eldest clergyman of boston a great scholar like most of his contemporaries in the profession and withal a man of kind and genial spirit this last attribute however had been less carefully developed than his intellectual gifts and was in truth rather a matter of shame than selfcongratulation with him there he stood with a border of grizzled locks beneath his skullcap while his gray eyes accustomed to the shaded light of his study were winking like those of hesters infant in the unadulterated sunshine he looked like the darkly engraved portraits which we see prefixed to old volumes of sermons and had no more right than one of those portraits would have to step forth as he now did and meddle with a question of human guilt passion and anguish ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne said the clergyman i have striven with my young brother here under whose preaching of the word you have been privileged to sithere mr wilson laid his hand on the shoulder of a pale young man beside himi have sought i say to persuade this godly youth that he should deal with you here in the face of heaven and before these wise and upright rulers and in hearing of all the people as touching the vileness and blackness of your sin knowing your natural temper better than i he could the better judge what arguments to use whether of tenderness or terror such as might prevail over your hardness and obstinacy insomuch that you should no longer hide the name of him who tempted you to this grievous fall but he opposes to me with a young mans oversoftness albeit wise beyond his years that it were wronging the very nature of woman to force her to lay open her hearts secrets in such broad daylight and in presence of so great a multitude truly as i sought to convince him the shame lay in the commission of the sin and not in the showing of it forth what say you to it once again brother dimmesdale must it be thou or i that shall deal with this poor sinners soul ,The Scarlet Letter
there was a murmur among the dignified and reverend occupants of the balcony and governor bellingham gave expression to its purport speaking in an authoritative voice although tempered with respect towards the youthful clergyman whom he addressed ,The Scarlet Letter
the directness of this appeal drew the eyes of the whole crowd upon the reverend mr dimmesdale a young clergyman who had come from one of the great english universities bringing all the learning of the age into our wild forestland his eloquence and religious fervor had already given the earnest of high eminence in his profession he was a person of very striking aspect with a white lofty and impending brow large brown melancholy eyes and a mouth which unless when he forcibly compressed it was apt to be tremulous expressing both nervous sensibility and a vast power of selfrestraint notwithstanding his high native gifts and scholarlike attainments there was an air about this young ministeran apprehensive a startled a halffrightened lookas of a being who felt himself quite astray and at a loss in the pathway of human existence and could only be at ease in some seclusion of his own therefore so far as his duties would permit he trod in the shadowy bypaths and thus kept himself simple and childlike coming forth when occasion was with a freshness and fragrance and dewy purity of thought which as many people said affected them like the speech of an angel ,The Scarlet Letter
such was the young man whom the reverend mr wilson and the governor had introduced so openly to the public notice bidding him speak in the hearing of all men to that mystery of a womans soul so sacred even in its pollution the trying nature of his position drove the blood from his cheek and made his lips tremulous ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne said he leaning over the balcony and looking down steadfastly into her eyes thou hearest what this good man says and seest the accountability under which i labor if thou feelest it to be for thy souls peace and that thy earthly punishment will thereby be made more effectual to salvation i charge thee to speak out the name of thy fellowsinner and fellowsufferer be not silent from any mistaken pity and tenderness for him for believe me hester though he were to step down from a high place and stand there beside thee on thy pedestal of shame yet better were it so than to hide a guilty heart through life what can thy silence do for him except it tempt himyea compel him as it wereto add hypocrisy to sin heaven hath granted thee an open ignominy that thereby thou mayest work out an open triumph over the evil within thee and the sorrow without take heed how thou deniest to himwho perchance hath not the courage to grasp it for himselfthe bitter but wholesome cup that is now presented to thy lips ,The Scarlet Letter
the young pastors voice was tremulously sweet rich deep and broken the feeling that it so evidently manifested rather than the direct purport of the words caused it to vibrate within all hearts and brought the listeners into one accord of sympathy even the poor baby at hesters bosom was affected by the same influence for it directed its hitherto vacant gaze towards mr dimmesdale and held up its little arms with a halfpleased halfplaintive murmur so powerful seemed the ministers appeal that the people could not believe but that hester prynne would speak out the guilty name or else that the guilty one himself in whatever high or lowly place he stood would be drawn forth by an inward and inevitable necessity and compelled to ascend to the scaffold ,The Scarlet Letter
woman transgress not beyond the limits of heavens mercy cried the reverend mr wilson more harshly than before that little babe hath been gifted with a voice to second and confirm the counsel which thou hast heard speak out the name that and thy repentance may avail to take the scarlet letter off thy breast ,The Scarlet Letter
never replied hester prynne looking not at mr wilson but into the deep and troubled eyes of the younger clergyman it is too deeply branded ye cannot take it off and would that i might endure his agony as well as mine ,The Scarlet Letter
i will not speak answered hester turning pale as death but responding to this voice which she too surely recognized and my child must seek a heavenly father she shall never know an earthly one ,The Scarlet Letter
she will not speak murmured mr dimmesdale who leaning over the balcony with his hand upon his heart had awaited the result of his appeal he now drew back with a long respiration wondrous strength and generosity of a womans heart she will not speak ,The Scarlet Letter
discerning the impracticable state of the poor culprits mind the elder clergyman who had carefully prepared himself for the occasion addressed to the multitude a discourse on sin in all its branches but with continual reference to the ignominious letter so forcibly did he dwell upon this symbol for the hour or more during which his periods were rolling over the peoples heads that it assumed new terrors in their imagination and seemed to derive its scarlet hue from the flames of the infernal pit hester prynne meanwhile kept her place upon the pedestal of shame with glazed eyes and an air of weary indifference she had borne that morning all that nature could endure and as her temperament was not of the order that escapes from too intense suffering by a swoon her spirit could only shelter itself beneath a stony crust of insensibility while the faculties of animal life remained entire in this state the voice of the preacher thundered remorselessly but unavailingly upon her ears the infant during the latter portion of her ordeal pierced the air with its wailings and screams she strove to hush it mechanically but seemed scarcely to sympathize with its trouble with the same hard demeanor she was led back to prison and vanished from the public gaze within its ironclamped portal it was whispered by those who peered after her that the scarlet letter threw a lurid gleam along the dark passageway of the interior ,The Scarlet Letter
after her return to the prison hester prynne was found to be in a state of nervous excitement that demanded constant watchfulness lest she should perpetrate violence on herself or do some halffrenzied mischief to the poor babe as night approached it proving impossible to quell her insubordination by rebuke or threats of punishment master brackett the jailer thought fit to introduce a physician he described him as a man of skill in all christian modes of physical science and likewise familiar with whatever the savage people could teach in respect to medicinal herbs and roots that grew in the forest to say the truth there was much need of professional assistance not merely for hester herself but still more urgently for the child who drawing its sustenance from the maternal bosom seemed to have drank in with it all the turmoil the anguish and despair which pervaded the mothers system it now writhed in convulsions of pain and was a forcible type in its little frame of the moral agony which hester prynne had borne throughout the day ,The Scarlet Letter
closely following the jailer into the dismal apartment appeared that individual of singular aspect whose presence in the crowd had been of such deep interest to the wearer of the scarlet letter he was lodged in the prison not as suspected of any offence but as the most convenient and suitable mode of disposing of him until the magistrates should have conferred with the indian sagamores respecting his ransom his name was announced as roger chillingworth the jailer after ushering him into the room remained a moment marvelling at the comparative quiet that followed his entrance for hester prynne had immediately become as still as death although the child continued to moan ,The Scarlet Letter
prithee friend leave me alone with my patient said the practitioner trust me good jailer you shall briefly have peace in your house and i promise you mistress prynne shall hereafter be more amenable to just authority than you may have found her heretofore ,The Scarlet Letter
nay if your worship can accomplish that answered master brackett i shall own you for a man of skill indeed verily the woman hath been like a possessed one and there lacks little that i should take in hand to drive satan out of her with stripes ,The Scarlet Letter
the stranger had entered the room with the characteristic quietude of the profession to which he announced himself as belonging nor did his demeanor change when the withdrawal of the prisonkeeper left him face to face with the woman whose absorbed notice of him in the crowd had intimated so close a relation between himself and her his first care was given to the child whose cries indeed as she lay writhing on the trundlebed made it of peremptory necessity to postpone all other business to the task of soothing her he examined the infant carefully and then proceeded to unclasp a leathern case which he took from beneath his dress it appeared to contain medical preparations one of which he mingled with a cup of water ,The Scarlet Letter
my old studies in alchemy observed he and my sojourn for above a year past among a people well versed in the kindly properties of simples have made a better physician of me than many that claim the medical degree here woman the child is yoursshe is none of mineneither will she recognize my voice or aspect as a fathers administer this draught therefore with thine own hand ,The Scarlet Letter
foolish woman responded the physician half coldly half soothingly what should ail me to harm this misbegotten and miserable babe the medicine is potent for good and were it my childyea mine own as well as thinei could do no better for it ,The Scarlet Letter
as she still hesitated being in fact in no reasonable state of mind he took the infant in his arms and himself administered the draught it soon proved its efficacy and redeemed the leechs pledge the moans of the little patient subsided its convulsive tossings gradually ceased and in a few moments as is the custom of young children after relief from pain it sank into a profound and dewy slumber the physician as he had a fair right to be termed next bestowed his attention on the mother with calm and intent scrutiny he felt her pulse looked into her eyesa gaze that made her heart shrink and shudder because so familiar and yet so strange and coldand finally satisfied with his investigation proceeded to mingle another draught ,The Scarlet Letter
i know not lethe nor nepenthe remarked he but i have learned many new secrets in the wilderness and here is one of thema recipe that an indian taught me in requital of some lessons of my own that were as old as paracelsus drink it it may be less soothing than a sinless conscience that i cannot give thee but it will calm the swell and heaving of thy passion like oil thrown on the waves of a tempestuous sea ,The Scarlet Letter
he presented the cup to hester who received it with a slow earnest look into his face not precisely a look of fear yet full of doubt and questioning as to what his purposes might be she looked also at her slumbering child ,The Scarlet Letter
i have thought of death said shehave wished for itwould even have prayed for it were it fit that such as i should pray for anything yet if death be in this cup i bid thee think again ere thou beholdest me quaff it see it is even now at my lips ,The Scarlet Letter
drink then replied he still with the same cold composure dost thou know me so little hester prynne are my purposes wont to be so shallow even if i imagine a scheme of vengeance what could i do better for my object than to let thee livethan to give thee medicines against all harm and peril of lifeso that this burning shame may still blaze upon thy bosom as he spoke he laid his long forefinger on the scarlet letter which forthwith seemed to scorch into hesters breast as if it had been redhot he noticed her involuntary gesture and smiled live therefore and bear about thy doom with thee in the eyes of men and womenin the eyes of him whom thou didst call thy husbandin the eyes of yonder child and that thou mayest live take off this draught ,The Scarlet Letter
without further expostulation or delay hester prynne drained the cup and at the motion of the man of skill seated herself on the bed where the child was sleeping while he drew the only chair which the room afforded and took his own seat beside her she could not but tremble at these preparations for she felt thathaving now done all that humanity or principle or if so it were a refined cruelty impelled him to do for the relief of physical sufferinghe was next to treat with her as the man whom she had most deeply and irreparably injured ,The Scarlet Letter
hester said he i ask not wherefore nor how thou hast fallen into the pit or say rather thou hast ascended to the pedestal of infamy on which i found thee the reason is not far to seek it was my folly and thy weakness ia man of thoughtthe bookworm of great librariesa man already in decay having given my best years to feed the hungry dream of knowledgewhat had i to do with youth and beauty like thine own misshapen from my birthhour how could i delude myself with the idea that intellectual gifts might veil physical deformity in a young girls fantasy men call me wise if sages were ever wise in their own behoof i might have foreseen all this i might have known that as i came out of the vast and dismal forest and entered this settlement of christian men the very first object to meet my eyes would be thyself hester prynne standing up a statue of ignominy before the people nay from the moment when we came down the old church steps together a married pair i might have beheld the balefire of that scarlet letter blazing at the end of our path ,The Scarlet Letter
true replied he it was my folly i have said it but up to that epoch of my life i had lived in vain the world had been so cheerless my heart was a habitation large enough for many guests but lonely and chill and without a household fire i longed to kindle one it seemed not so wild a dreamold as i was and sombre as i was and misshapen as i wasthat the simple bliss which is scattered far and wide for all mankind to gather up might yet be mine and so hester i drew thee into my heart into its innermost chamber and sought to warm thee by the warmth which thy presence made there ,The Scarlet Letter
we have wronged each other answered he mine was the first wrong when i betrayed thy budding youth into a false and unnatural relation with my decay therefore as a man who has not thought and philosophized in vain i seek no vengeance plot no evil against thee between thee and me the scale hangs fairly balanced but hester the man lives who has wronged us both who is he ,The Scarlet Letter
never sayest thou rejoined he with a smile of dark and selfrelying intelligence never know him believe me hester there are few thingswhether in the outward world or to a certain depth in the invisible sphere of thoughtfew things hidden from the man who devotes himself earnestly and unreservedly to the solution of a mystery thou mayest cover up thy secret from the prying multitude thou mayest conceal it too from the ministers and magistrates even as thou didst this day when they sought to wrench the name out of thy heart and give thee a partner on thy pedestal but as for me i come to the inquest with other senses than they possess i shall seek this man as i have sought truth in books as i have sought gold in alchemy there is a sympathy that will make me conscious of him i shall see him tremble i shall feel myself shudder suddenly and unawares sooner or later he must needs be mine ,The Scarlet Letter
thou wilt not reveal his name not the less he is mine resumed he with a look of confidence as if destiny were at one with him he bears no letter of infamy wrought into his garment as thou dost but i shall read it on his heart yet fear not for him think not that i shall interfere with heavens own method of retribution or to my own loss betray him to the gripe of human law neither do thou imagine that i shall contrive aught against his life no nor against his fame if as i judge he be a man of fair repute let him live let him hide himself in outward honor if he may not the less he shall be mine ,The Scarlet Letter
one thing thou that wast my wife i would enjoin upon thee continued the scholar thou hast kept the secret of thy paramour keep likewise mine there are none in this land that know me breathe not to any human soul that thou didst ever call me husband here on this wild outskirt of the earth i shall pitch my tent for elsewhere a wanderer and isolated from human interests i find here a woman a man a child amongst whom and myself there exist the closest ligaments no matter whether of love or hate no matter whether of right or wrong thou and thine hester prynne belong to me my home is where thou art and where he is but betray me not ,The Scarlet Letter
it may be he replied because i will not encounter the dishonor that besmirches the husband of a faithless woman it may be for other reasons enough it is my purpose to live and die unknown let therefore thy husband be to the world as one already dead and of whom no tidings shall ever come recognize me not by word by sign by look breathe not the secret above all to the man thou wottest of shouldst thou fail me in this beware his fame his position his life will be in my hands beware ,The Scarlet Letter
and now mistress prynne said old roger chillingworth as he was hereafter to be named i leave thee alone alone with thy infant and the scarlet letter how is it hester doth thy sentence bind thee to wear the token in thy sleep art thou not afraid of nightmares and hideous dreams ,The Scarlet Letter
why dost thou smile so at me inquired hester troubled at the expression of his eyes art thou like the black man that haunts the forest round about us hast thou enticed me into a bond that will prove the ruin of my soul ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynnes term of confinement was now at an end her prisondoor was thrown open and she came forth into the sunshine which falling on all alike seemed to her sick and morbid heart as if meant for no other purpose than to reveal the scarlet letter on her breast perhaps there was a more real torture in her first unattended footsteps from the threshold of the prison than even in the procession and spectacle that have been described where she was made the common infamy at which all mankind was summoned to point its finger then she was supported by an unnatural tension of the nerves and by all the combative energy of her character which enabled her to convert the scene into a kind of lurid triumph it was moreover a separate and insulated event to occur but once in her lifetime and to meet which therefore reckless of economy she might call up the vital strength that would have sufficed for many quiet years the very law that condemned hera giant of stern features but with vigor to support as well as to annihilate in his iron armhad held her up through the terrible ordeal of her ignominy but now with this unattended walk from her prisondoor began the daily custom and she must either sustain and carry it forward by the ordinary resources of her nature or sink beneath it she could no longer borrow from the future to help her through the present grief tomorrow would bring its own trial with it so would the next day and so would the next each its own trial and yet the very same that was now so unutterably grievous to be borne the days of the faroff future would toil onward still with the same burden for her to take up and bear along with her but never to fling down for the accumulating days and added years would pile up their misery upon the heap of shame throughout them all giving up her individuality she would become the general symbol at which the preacher and moralist might point and in which they might vivify and embody their images of womans frailty and sinful passion thus the young and pure would be taught to look at her with the scarlet letter flaming on her breastat her the child of honorable parentsat her the mother of a babe that would hereafter be a womanat her who had once been innocentas the figure the body the reality of sin and over her grave the infamy that she must carry thither would be her only monument ,The Scarlet Letter
it may seem marvellous that with the world before herkept by no restrictive clause of her condemnation within the limits of the puritan settlement so remote and so obscurefree to return to her birthplace or to any other european land and there hide her character and identity under a new exterior as completely as if emerging into another state of beingand having also the passes of the dark inscrutable forest open to her where the wildness of her nature might assimilate itself with a people whose customs and life were alien from the law that had condemned herit may seem marvellous that this woman should still call that place her home where and where only she must needs be the type of shame but there is a fatality a feeling so irresistible and inevitable that it has the force of doom which almost invariably compels human beings to linger around and haunt ghostlike the spot where some great and marked event has given the color to their lifetime and still the more irresistibly the darker the tinge that saddens it her sin her ignominy were the roots which she had struck into the soil it was as if a new birth with stronger assimilations than the first had converted the forestland still so uncongenial to every other pilgrim and wanderer into hester prynnes wild and dreary but lifelong home all other scenes of eartheven that village of rural england where happy infancy and stainless maidenhood seemed yet to be in her mothers keeping like garments put off long agowere foreign to her in comparison the chain that bound her here was of iron links and galling to her inmost soul but could never be broken ,The Scarlet Letter
it might be toodoubtless it was so although she hid the secret from herself and grew pale whenever it struggled out of her heart like a serpent from its holeit might be that another feeling kept her within the scene and pathway that had been so fatal there dwelt there trode the feet of one with whom she deemed herself connected in a union that unrecognized on earth would bring them together before the bar of final judgment and make that their marriagealtar for a joint futurity of endless retribution over and over again the tempter of souls had thrust this idea upon hesters contemplation and laughed at the passionate and desperate joy with which she seized and then strove to cast it from her she barely looked the idea in the face and hastened to bar it in its dungeon what she compelled herself to believewhat finally she reasoned upon as her motive for continuing a resident of new englandwas half a truth and half a selfdelusion here she said to herself had been the scene of her guilt and here should be the scene of her earthly punishment and so perchance the torture of her daily shame would at length purge her soul and work out another purity than that which she had lost more saintlike because the result of martyrdom ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne therefore did not flee on the outskirts of the town within the verge of the peninsula but not in close vicinity to any other habitation there was a small thatched cottage it had been built by an earlier settler and abandoned because the soil about it was too sterile for cultivation while its comparative remoteness put it out of the sphere of that social activity which already marked the habits of the emigrants it stood on the shore looking across a basin of the sea at the forestcovered hills towards the west a clump of scrubby trees such as alone grew on the peninsula did not so much conceal the cottage from view as seem to denote that here was some object which would fain have been or at least ought to be concealed in this little lonesome dwelling with some slender means that she possessed and by the license of the magistrates who still kept an inquisitorial watch over her hester established herself with her infant child a mystic shadow of suspicion immediately attached itself to the spot children too young to comprehend wherefore this woman should be shut out from the sphere of human charities would creep nigh enough to behold her plying her needle at the cottagewindow or standing in the doorway or laboring in her little garden or coming forth along the pathway that led townward and discerning the scarlet letter on her breast would scamper off with a strange contagious fear ,The Scarlet Letter
lonely as was hesters situation and without a friend on earth who dared to show himself she however incurred no risk of want she possessed an art that sufficed even in a land that afforded comparatively little scope for its exercise to supply food for her thriving infant and herself it was the artthen as now almost the only one within a womans graspof needlework she bore on her breast in the curiously embroidered letter a specimen of her delicate and imaginative skill of which the dames of a court might gladly have availed themselves to add the richer and more spiritual adornment of human ingenuity to their fabrics of silk and gold here indeed in the sable simplicity that generally characterized the puritanic modes of dress there might be an infrequent call for the finer productions of her handiwork yet the taste of the age demanding whatever was elaborate in compositions of this kind did not fail to extend its influence over our stern progenitors who had cast behind them so many fashions which it might seem harder to dispense with public ceremonies such as ordinations the installation of magistrates and all that could give majesty to the forms in which a new government manifested itself to the people were as a matter of policy marked by a stately and wellconducted ceremonial and a sombre but yet a studied magnificence deep ruffs painfully wrought bands and gorgeously embroidered gloves were all deemed necessary to the official state of men assuming the reins of power and were readily allowed to individuals dignified by rank or wealth even while sumptuary laws forbade these and similar extravagances to the plebeian order in the array of funerals toowhether for the apparel of the dead body or to typify by manifold emblematic devices of sable cloth and snowy lawn the sorrow of the survivorsthere was a frequent and characteristic demand for such labor as hester prynne could supply babylinenfor babies then wore robes of stateafforded still another possibility of toil and emolument ,The Scarlet Letter
by degrees nor very slowly her handiwork became what would now be termed the fashion whether from commiseration for a woman of so miserable a destiny or from the morbid curiosity that gives a fictitious value even to common or worthless things or by whatever other intangible circumstance was then as now sufficient to bestow on some persons what others might seek in vain or because hester really filled a gap which must otherwise have remained vacant it is certain that she had ready and fairly requited employment for as many hours as she saw fit to occupy with her needle vanity it may be chose to mortify itself by putting on for ceremonials of pomp and state the garments that had been wrought by her sinful hands her needlework was seen on the ruff of the governor military men wore it on their scarfs and the minister on his band it decked the babys little cap it was shut up to be mildewed and moulder away in the coffins of the dead but it is not recorded that in a single instance her skill was called in aid to embroider the white veil which was to cover the pure blushes of a bride the exception indicated the everrelentless rigor with which society frowned upon her sin ,The Scarlet Letter
hester sought not to acquire anything beyond a subsistence of the plainest and most ascetic description for herself and a simple abundance for her child her own dress was of the coarsest materials and the most sombre hue with only that one ornamentthe scarlet letterwhich it was her doom to wear the childs attire on the other hand was distinguished by a fanciful or we might rather say a fantastic ingenuity which served indeed to heighten the airy charm that early began to develop itself in the little girl but which appeared to have also a deeper meaning we may speak further of it hereafter except for that small expenditure in the decoration of her infant hester bestowed all her superfluous means in charity on wretches less miserable than herself and who not unfrequently insulted the hand that fed them much of the time which she might readily have applied to the better efforts of her art she employed in making coarse garments for the poor it is probable that there was an idea of penance in this mode of occupation and that she offered up a real sacrifice of enjoyment in devoting so many hours to such rude handiwork she had in her nature a rich voluptuous oriental characteristica taste for the gorgeously beautiful which save in the exquisite productions of her needle found nothing else in all the possibilities of her life to exercise itself upon women derive a pleasure incomprehensible to the other sex from the delicate toil of the needle to hester prynne it might have been a mode of expressing and therefore soothing the passion of her life like all other joys she rejected it as sin this morbid meddling of conscience with an immaterial matter betokened it is to be feared no genuine and steadfast penitence but something doubtful something that might be deeply wrong beneath ,The Scarlet Letter
in this manner hester prynne came to have a part to perform in the world with her native energy of character and rare capacity it could not entirely cast her off although it had set a mark upon her more intolerable to a womans heart than that which branded the brow of cain in all her intercourse with society however there was nothing that made her feel as if she belonged to it every gesture every word and even the silence of those with whom she came in contact implied and often expressed that she was banished and as much alone as if she inhabited another sphere or communicated with the common nature by other organs and senses than the rest of human kind she stood apart from moral interests yet close beside them like a ghost that revisits the familiar fireside and can no longer make itself seen or felt no more smile with the household joy nor mourn with the kindred sorrow or should it succeed in manifesting its forbidden sympathy awakening only terror and horrible repugnance these emotions in fact and its bitterest scorn besides seemed to be the sole portion that she retained in the universal heart it was not an age of delicacy and her position although she understood it well and was in little danger of forgetting it was often brought before her vivid selfperception like a new anguish by the rudest touch upon the tenderest spot the poor as we have already said whom she sought out to be the objects of her bounty often reviled the hand that was stretched forth to succor them dames of elevated rank likewise whose doors she entered in the way of her occupation were accustomed to distil drops of bitterness into her heart sometimes through that alchemy of quiet malice by which women can concoct a subtle poison from ordinary trifles and sometimes also by a coarser expression that fell upon the sufferers defenceless breast like a rough blow upon an ulcerated wound hester had schooled herself long and well she never responded to these attacks save by a flush of crimson that rose irrepressibly over her pale cheek and again subsided into the depths of her bosom she was patienta martyr indeedbut she forbore to pray for her enemies lest in spite of her forgiving aspirations the words of the blessing should stubbornly twist themselves into a curse ,The Scarlet Letter
continually and in a thousand other ways did she feel the innumerable throbs of anguish that had been so cunningly contrived for her by the undying the everactive sentence of the puritan tribunal clergymen paused in the street to address words of exhortation that brought a crowd with its mingled grin and frown around the poor sinful woman if she entered a church trusting to share the sabbath smile of the universal father it was often her mishap to find herself the text of the discourse she grew to have a dread of children for they had imbibed from their parents a vague idea of something horrible in this dreary woman gliding silently through the town with never any companion but one only child therefore first allowing her to pass they pursued her at a distance with shrill cries and the utterance of a word that had no distinct purport to their own minds but was none the less terrible to her as proceeding from lips that babbled it unconsciously it seemed to argue so wide a diffusion of her shame that all nature knew of it it could have caused her no deeper pang had the leaves of the trees whispered the dark story among themselveshad the summer breeze murmured about ithad the wintry blast shrieked it aloud another peculiar torture was felt in the gaze of a new eye when strangers looked curiously at the scarlet letterand none ever failed to do sothey branded it afresh into hesters soul so that oftentimes she could scarcely refrain yet always did refrain from covering the symbol with her hand but then again an accustomed eye had likewise its own anguish to inflict its cool stare of familiarity was intolerable from first to last in short hester prynne had always this dreadful agony in feeling a human eye upon the token the spot never grew callous it seemed on the contrary to grow more sensitive with daily torture ,The Scarlet Letter
but sometimes once in many days or perchance in many months she felt an eyea human eyeupon the ignominious brand that seemed to give a momentary relief as if half of her agony were shared the next instant back it all rushed again with still a deeper throb of pain for in that brief interval she had sinned anew had hester sinned alone ,The Scarlet Letter
her imagination was somewhat affected and had she been of a softer moral and intellectual fibre would have been still more so by the strange and solitary anguish of her life walking to and fro with those lonely footsteps in the little world with which she was outwardly connected it now and then appeared to hesterif altogether fancy it was nevertheless too potent to be resistedshe felt or fancied then that the scarlet letter had endowed her with a new sense she shuddered to believe yet could not help believing that it gave her a sympathetic knowledge of the hidden sin in other hearts she was terrorstricken by the revelations that were thus made what were they could they be other than the insidious whispers of the bad angel who would fain have persuaded the struggling woman as yet only half his victim that the outward guise of purity was but a lie and that if truth were everywhere to be shown a scarlet letter would blaze forth on many a bosom besides hester prynnes or must she receive those intimationsso obscure yet so distinctas truth in all her miserable experience there was nothing else so awful and so loathsome as this sense it perplexed as well as shocked her by the irreverent inopportuneness of the occasions that brought it into vivid action sometimes the red infamy upon her breast would give a sympathetic throb as she passed near a venerable minister or magistrate the model of piety and justice to whom that age of antique reverence looked up as to a mortal man in fellowship with angels what evil thing is at hand would hester say to herself lifting her reluctant eyes there would be nothing human within the scope of view save the form of this earthly saint again a mystic sisterhood would contumaciously assert itself as she met the sanctified frown of some matron who according to the rumor of all tongues had kept cold snow within her bosom throughout life that unsunned snow in the matrons bosom and the burning shame on hester prynneswhat had the two in common or once more the electric thrill would give her warningbehold hester here is a companionand looking up she would detect the eyes of a young maiden glancing at the scarlet letter shyly and aside and quickly averted with a faint chill crimson in her cheeks as if her purity were somewhat sullied by that momentary glance o fiend whose talisman was that fatal symbol wouldst thou leave nothing whether in youth or age for this poor sinner to reveresuch loss of faith is ever one of the saddest results of sin be it accepted as a proof that all was not corrupt in this poor victim of her own frailty and mans hard law that hester prynne yet struggled to believe that no fellowmortal was guilty like herself ,The Scarlet Letter
the vulgar who in those dreary old times were always contributing a grotesque horror to what interested their imaginations had a story about the scarlet letter which we might readily work up into a terrific legend they averred that the symbol was not mere scarlet cloth tinged in an earthly dyepot but was redhot with infernal fire and could be seen glowing all alight whenever hester prynne walked abroad in the nighttime and we must needs say it seared hesters bosom so deeply that perhaps there was more truth in the rumor than our modern incredulity may be inclined to admit ,The Scarlet Letter
we have as yet hardly spoken of the infant that little creature whose innocent life had sprung by the inscrutable decree of providence a lovely and immortal flower out of the rank luxuriance of a guilty passion how strange it seemed to the sad woman as she watched the growth and the beauty that became every day more brilliant and the intelligence that threw its quivering sunshine over the tiny features of this child her pearlfor so had hester called her not as a name expressive of her aspect which had nothing of the calm white unimpassioned lustre that would be indicated by the comparison but she named the infant pearl as being of great pricepurchased with all she hadher mothers only treasure how strange indeed man had marked this womans sin by a scarlet letter which had such potent and disastrous efficacy that no human sympathy could reach her save it were sinful like herself god as a direct consequence of the sin which man thus punished had given her a lovely child whose place was on that same dishonored bosom to connect her parent forever with the race and descent of mortals and to be finally a blessed soul in heaven yet these thoughts affected hester prynne less with hope than apprehension she knew that her deed had been evil she could have no faith therefore that its result would be good day after day she looked fearfully into the childs expanding nature ever dreading to detect some dark and wild peculiarity that should correspond with the guiltiness to which she owed her being ,The Scarlet Letter
certainly there was no physical defect by its perfect shape its vigor and its natural dexterity in the use of all its untried limbs the infant was worthy to have been brought forth in eden worthy to have been left there to be the plaything of the angels after the worlds first parents were driven out the child had a native grace which does not invariably coexist with faultless beauty its attire however simple always impressed the beholder as if it were the very garb that precisely became it best but little pearl was not clad in rustic weeds her mother with a morbid purpose that may be better understood hereafter had bought the richest tissues that could be procured and allowed her imaginative faculty its full play in the arrangement and decoration of the dresses which the child wore before the public eye so magnificent was the small figure when thus arrayed and such was the splendor of pearls own proper beauty shining through the gorgeous robes which might have extinguished a paler loveliness that there was an absolute circle of radiance around her on the darksome cottage floor and yet a russet gown torn and soiled with the childs rude play made a picture of her just as perfect pearls aspect was imbued with a spell of infinite variety in this one child there were many children comprehending the full scope between the wildflower prettiness of a peasantbaby and the pomp in little of an infant princess throughout all however there was a trait of passion a certain depth of hue which she never lost and if in any of her changes she had grown fainter or paler she would have ceased to be herselfit would have been no longer pearl ,The Scarlet Letter
this outward mutability indicated and did not more than fairly express the various properties of her inner life her nature appeared to possess depth too as well as variety butor else hesters fears deceived herit lacked reference and adaptation to the world into which she was born the child could not be made amenable to rules in giving her existence a great law had been broken and the result was a being whose elements were perhaps beautiful and brilliant but all in disorder or with an order peculiar to themselves amidst which the point of variety and arrangement was difficult or impossible to be discovered hester could only account for the childs characterand even then most vaguely and imperfectlyby recalling what she herself had been during that momentous period while pearl was imbibing her soul from the spiritual world and her bodily frame from its material of earth the mothers impassioned state had been the medium through which were transmitted to the unborn infant the rays of its moral life and however white and clear originally they had taken the deep stains of crimson and gold the fiery lustre the black shadow and the untempered light of the intervening substance above all the warfare of hesters spirit at that epoch was perpetuated in pearl she could recognize her wild desperate defiant mood the flightiness of her temper and even some of the very cloudshapes of gloom and despondency that had brooded in her heart they were now illuminated by the morning radiance of a young childs disposition but later in the day of earthly existence might be prolific of the storm and whirlwind ,The Scarlet Letter
the discipline of the family in those days was of a far more rigid kind than now the frown the harsh rebuke the frequent application of the rod enjoined by scriptural authority were used not merely in the way of punishment for actual offences but as a wholesome regimen for the growth and promotion of all childish virtues hester prynne nevertheless the lonely mother of this one child ran little risk of erring on the side of undue severity mindful however of her own errors and misfortunes she early sought to impose a tender but strict control over the infant immortality that was committed to her charge but the task was beyond her skill after testing both smiles and frowns and proving that neither mode of treatment possessed any calculable influence hester was ultimately compelled to stand aside and permit the child to be swayed by her own impulses physical compulsion or restraint was effectual of course while it lasted as to any other kind of discipline whether addressed to her mind or heart little pearl might or might not be within its reach in accordance with the caprice that ruled the moment her mother while pearl was yet an infant grew acquainted with a certain peculiar look that warned her when it would be labor thrown away to insist persuade or plead it was a look so intelligent yet inexplicable so perverse sometimes so malicious but generally accompanied by a wild flow of spirits that hester could not help questioning at such moments whether pearl were a human child she seemed rather an airy sprite which after playing its fantastic sports for a little while upon the cottage floor would flit away with a mocking smile whenever that look appeared in her wild bright deeply black eyes it invested her with a strange remoteness and intangibility it was as if she were hovering in the air and might vanish like a glimmering light that comes we know not whence and goes we know not whither beholding it hester was constrained to rush towards the childto pursue the little elf in the flight which she invariably beganto snatch her to her bosom with a close pressure and earnest kissesnot so much from overflowing love as to assure herself that pearl was flesh and blood and not utterly delusive but pearls laugh when she was caught though full of merriment and music made her mother more doubtful than before ,The Scarlet Letter
heartsmitten at this bewildering and baffling spell that so often came between herself and her sole treasure whom she had bought so dear and who was all her world hester sometimes burst into passionate tears then perhapsfor there was no foreseeing how it might affect herpearl would frown and clench her little fist and harden her small features into a stern unsympathizing look of discontent not seldom she would laugh anew and louder than before like a thing incapable and unintelligent of human sorrow orbut this more rarely happenedshe would be convulsed with a rage of grief and sob out her love for her mother in broken words and seem intent on proving that she had a heart by breaking it yet hester was hardly safe in confiding herself to that gusty tenderness it passed as suddenly as it came brooding over all these matters the mother felt like one who has evoked a spirit but by some irregularity in the process of conjuration has failed to win the masterword that should control this new and incomprehensible intelligence her only real comfort was when the child lay in the placidity of sleep then she was sure of her and tasted hours of quiet sad delicious happiness untilperhaps with that perverse expression glimmering from beneath her opening lidslittle pearl awoke ,The Scarlet Letter
how soonwith what strange rapidity indeeddid pearl arrive at an age that was capable of social intercourse beyond the mothers everready smile and nonsensewords and then what a happiness would it have been could hester prynne have heard her clear birdlike voice mingling with the uproar of other childish voices and have distinguished and unravelled her own darlings tones amid all the entangled outcry of a group of sportive children but this could never be pearl was a born outcast of the infantile world an imp of evil emblem and product of sin she had no right among christened infants nothing was more remarkable than the instinct as it seemed with which the child comprehended her loneliness the destiny that had drawn an inviolable circle round about her the whole peculiarity in short of her position in respect to other children never since her release from prison had hester met the public gaze without her in all her walks about the town pearl too was there first as the babe in arms and afterwards as the little girl small companion of her mother holding a forefinger with her whole grasp and tripping along at the rate of three or four footsteps to one of hesters she saw the children of the settlement on the grassy margin of the street or at the domestic thresholds disporting themselves in such grim fashion as the puritanic nurture would permit playing at going to church perchance or at scourging quakers or taking scalps in a shamfight with the indians or scaring one another with freaks of imitative witchcraft pearl saw and gazed intently but never sought to make acquaintance if spoken to she would not speak again if the children gathered about her as they sometimes did pearl would grow positively terrible in her puny wrath snatching up stones to fling at them with shrill incoherent exclamations that made her mother tremble because they had so much the sound of a witchs anathemas in some unknown tongue ,The Scarlet Letter
the truth was that the little puritans being of the most intolerant brood that ever lived had got a vague idea of something outlandish unearthly or at variance with ordinary fashions in the mother and child and therefore scorned them in their hearts and not unfrequently reviled them with their tongues pearl felt the sentiment and requited it with the bitterest hatred that can be supposed to rankle in a childish bosom these outbreaks of a fierce temper had a kind of value and even comfort for her mother because there was at least an intelligible earnestness in the mood instead of the fitful caprice that so often thwarted her in the childs manifestations it appalled her nevertheless to discern here again a shadowy reflection of the evil that had existed in herself all this enmity and passion had pearl inherited by inalienable right out of hesters heart mother and daughter stood together in the same circle of seclusion from human society and in the nature of the child seemed to be perpetuated those unquiet elements that had distracted hester prynne before pearls birth but had since begun to be soothed away by the softening influences of maternity ,The Scarlet Letter
at home within and around her mothers cottage pearl wanted not a wide and various circle of acquaintance the spell of life went forth from her evercreative spirit and communicated itself to a thousand objects as a torch kindles a flame wherever it may be applied the unlikeliest materialsa stick a bunch of rags a flowerwere the puppets of pearls witchcraft and without undergoing any outward change became spiritually adapted to whatever drama occupied the stage of her inner world her one babyvoice served a multitude of imaginary personages old and young to talk withal the pinetrees aged black and solemn and flinging groans and other melancholy utterances on the breeze needed little transformation to figure as puritan elders the ugliest weeds of the garden were their children whom pearl smote down and uprooted most unmercifully it was wonderful the vast variety of forms into which she threw her intellect with no continuity indeed but darting up and dancing always in a state of preternatural activitysoon sinking down as if exhausted by so rapid and feverish a tide of lifeand succeeded by other shapes of a similar wild energy it was like nothing so much as the phantasmagoric play of the northern lights in the mere exercise of the fancy however and the sportiveness of a growing mind there might be little more than was observable in other children of bright faculties except as pearl in the dearth of human playmates was thrown more upon the visionary throng which she created the singularity lay in the hostile feelings with which the child regarded all these offspring of her own heart and mind she never created a friend but seemed always to be sowing broadcast the dragons teeth whence sprung a harvest of armed enemies against whom she rushed to battle it was inexpressibly sadthen what depth of sorrow to a mother who felt in her own heart the causeto observe in one so young this constant recognition of an adverse world and so fierce a training of the energies that were to make good her cause in the contest that must ensue ,The Scarlet Letter
gazing at pearl hester prynne often dropped her work upon her knees and cried out with an agony which she would fain have hidden but which made utterance for itself betwixt speech and a groano father in heavenif thou art still my fatherwhat is this being which i have brought into the world and pearl overhearing the ejaculation or aware through some more subtile channel of those throbs of anguish would turn her vivid and beautiful little face upon her mother smile with spritelike intelligence and resume her play ,The Scarlet Letter
one peculiarity of the childs deportment remains yet to be told the very first thing which she had noticed in her life waswhatnot the mothers smile responding to it as other babies do by that faint embryo smile of the little mouth remembered so doubtfully afterwards and with such fond discussion whether it were indeed a smile by no means but that first object of which pearl seemed to become aware wasshall we say itthe scarlet letter on hesters bosom one day as her mother stooped over the cradle the infants eyes had been caught by the glimmering of the gold embroidery about the letter and putting up her little hand she grasped at it smiling not doubtfully but with a decided gleam that gave her face the look of a much older child then gasping for breath did hester prynne clutch the fatal token instinctively endeavoring to tear it away so infinite was the torture inflicted by the intelligent touch of pearls babyhand again as if her mothers agonized gesture were meant only to make sport for her did little pearl look into her eyes and smile from that epoch except when the child was asleep hester had never felt a moments safety not a moments calm enjoyment of her weeks it is true would sometimes elapse during which pearls gaze might never once be fixed upon the scarlet letter but then again it would come at unawares like the stroke of sudden death and always with that peculiar smile and odd expression of the eyes ,The Scarlet Letter
once this freakish elvish cast came into the childs eyes while hester was looking at her own image in them as mothers are fond of doing and suddenlyfor women in solitude and with troubled hearts are pestered with unaccountable delusionsshe fancied that she beheld not her own miniature portrait but another face in the small black mirror of pearls eye it was a face fiendlike full of smiling malice yet bearing the semblance of features that she had known full well though seldom with a smile and never with malice in them it was as if an evil spirit possessed the child and had just then peeped forth in mockery many a time afterwards had hester been tortured though less vividly by the same illusion ,The Scarlet Letter
in the afternoon of a certain summers day after pearl grew big enough to run about she amused herself with gathering handfuls of wildflowers and flinging them one by one at her mothers bosom dancing up and down like a little elf whenever she hit the scarlet letter hesters first motion had been to cover her bosom with her clasped hands but whether from pride or resignation or a feeling that her penance might best be wrought out by this unutterable pain she resisted the impulse and sat erect pale as death looking sadly into little pearls wild eyes still came the battery of flowers almost invariably hitting the mark and covering the mothers breast with hurts for which she could find no balm in this world nor knew how to seek it in another at last her shot being all expended the child stood still and gazed at hester with that little laughing image of a fiend peeping outor whether it peeped or no her mother so imagined itfrom the unsearchable abyss of her black eyes ,The Scarlet Letter
nor did she put the question altogether idly but for the moment with a portion of genuine earnestness for such was pearls wonderful intelligence that her mother half doubted whether she were not acquainted with the secret spell of her existence and might not now reveal herself ,The Scarlet Letter
thou art not my child thou art no pearl of mine said the mother half playfully for it was often the case that a sportive impulse came over her in the midst of her deepest suffering tell me then what thou art and who sent thee hither ,The Scarlet Letter
but she said it with a hesitation that did not escape the acuteness of the child whether moved only by her ordinary freakishness or because an evil spirit prompted her she put up her small forefinger and touched the scarlet letter ,The Scarlet Letter
hush pearl hush thou must not talk so answered the mother suppressing a groan he sent us all into this world he sent even me thy mother then much more thee or if not thou strange and elfish child whence didst thou come ,The Scarlet Letter
but hester could not resolve the query being herself in a dismal labyrinth of doubt she rememberedbetwixt a smile and a shudderthe talk of the neighboring townspeople who seeking vainly elsewhere for the childs paternity and observing some of her odd attributes had given out that poor little pearl was a demon offspring such as ever since old catholic times had occasionally been seen on earth through the agency of their mothers sin and to promote some foul and wicked purpose luther according to the scandal of his monkish enemies was a brat of that hellish breed nor was pearl the only child to whom this inauspicious origin was assigned among the new england puritans ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne went one day to the mansion of governor bellingham with a pair of gloves which she had fringed and embroidered to his order and which were to be worn on some great occasion of state for though the chances of a popular election had caused this former ruler to descend a step or two from the highest rank he still held an honorable and influential place among the colonial magistracy ,The Scarlet Letter
another and far more important reason than the delivery of a pair of embroidered gloves impelled hester at this time to seek an interview with a personage of so much power and activity in the affairs of the settlement it had reached her ears that there was a design on the part of some of the leading inhabitants cherishing the more rigid order of principles in religion and government to deprive her of her child on the supposition that pearl as already hinted was of demon origin these good people not unreasonably argued that a christian interest in the mothers soul required them to remove such a stumblingblock from her path if the child on the other hand were really capable of moral and religious growth and possessed the elements of ultimate salvation then surely it would enjoy all the fairer prospect of these advantages by being transferred to wiser and better guardianship than hester prynnes among those who promoted the design governor bellingham was said to be one of the most busy it may appear singular and indeed not a little ludicrous that an affair of this kind which in later days would have been referred to no higher jurisdiction than that of the selectmen of the town should then have been a question publicly discussed and on which statesmen of eminence took sides at that epoch of pristine simplicity however matters of even slighter public interest and of far less intrinsic weight than the welfare of hester and her child were strangely mixed up with the deliberations of legislators and acts of state the period was hardly if at all earlier than that of our story when a dispute concerning the right of property in a pig not only caused a fierce and bitter contest in the legislative body of the colony but resulted in an important modification of the framework itself of the legislature ,The Scarlet Letter
full of concern thereforebut so conscious of her own right that it seemed scarcely an unequal match between the public on the one side and a lonely woman backed by the sympathies of nature on the otherhester prynne set forth from her solitary cottage little pearl of course was her companion she was now of an age to run lightly along by her mothers side and constantly in motion from morn till sunset could have accomplished a much longer journey than that before her often nevertheless more from caprice than necessity she demanded to be taken up in arms but was soon as imperious to be set down again and frisked onward before hester on the grassy pathway with many a harmless trip and tumble we have spoken of pearls rich and luxuriant beauty a beauty that shone with deep and vivid tints a bright complexion eyes possessing intensity both of depth and glow and hair already of a deep glossy brown and which in after years would be nearly akin to black there was fire in her and throughout her she seemed the unpremeditated offshoot of a passionate moment her mother in contriving the childs garb had allowed the gorgeous tendencies of her imagination their full play arraying her in a crimson velvet tunic of a peculiar cut abundantly embroidered with fantasies and flourishes of goldthread so much strength of coloring which must have given a wan and pallid aspect to cheeks of a fainter bloom was admirably adapted to pearls beauty and made her the very brightest little jet of flame that ever danced upon the earth ,The Scarlet Letter
but it was a remarkable attribute of this garb and indeed of the childs whole appearance that it irresistibly and inevitably reminded the beholder of the token which hester prynne was doomed to wear upon her bosom it was the scarlet letter in another form the scarlet letter endowed with life the mother herselfas if the red ignominy were so deeply scorched into her brain that all her conceptions assumed its formhad carefully wrought out the similitude lavishing many hours of morbid ingenuity to create an analogy between the object of her affection and the emblem of her guilt and torture but in truth pearl was the one as well as the other and only in consequence of that identity had hester contrived so perfectly to represent the scarlet letter in her appearance ,The Scarlet Letter
as the two wayfarers came within the precincts of the town the children of the puritans looked up from their playor what passed for play with those sombre little urchinsand spake gravely one to another ,The Scarlet Letter
but pearl who was a dauntless child after frowning stamping her foot and shaking her little hand with a variety of threatening gestures suddenly made a rush at the knot of her enemies and put them all to flight she resembled in her fierce pursuit of them an infant pestilencethe scarlet fever or some such halffledged angel of judgmentwhose mission was to punish the sins of the rising generation she screamed and shouted too with a terrific volume of sound which doubtless caused the hearts of the fugitives to quake within them the victory accomplished pearl returned quietly to her mother and looked up smiling into her face ,The Scarlet Letter
without further adventure they reached the dwelling of governor bellingham this was a large wooden house built in a fashion of which there are specimens still extant in the streets of our older towns now mossgrown crumbling to decay and melancholy at heart with the many sorrowful or joyful occurrences remembered or forgotten that have happened and passed away within their dusky chambers then however there was the freshness of the passing year on its exterior and the cheerfulness gleaming forth from the sunny windows of a human habitation into which death had never entered it had indeed a very cheery aspect the walls being overspread with a kind of stucco in which fragments of broken glass were plentifully intermixed so that when the sunshine fell aslantwise over the front of the edifice it glittered and sparkled as if diamonds had been flung against it by the double handful the brilliancy might have befitted aladdins palace rather than the mansion of a grave old puritan ruler it was further decorated with strange and seemingly cabalistic figures and diagrams suitable to the quaint taste of the age which had been drawn in the stucco when newly laid on and had now grown hard and durable for the admiration of after times ,The Scarlet Letter
they approached the door which was of an arched form and flanked on each side by a narrow tower or projection of the edifice in both of which were latticewindows with wooden shutters to close over them at need lifting the iron hammer that hung at the portal hester prynne gave a summons which was answered by one of the governors bondservants a freeborn englishman but now a seven years slave during that term he was to be the property of his master and as much a commodity of bargain and sale as an ox or a jointstool the serf wore the blue coat which was the customary garb of servingmen of that period and long before in the old hereditary halls of england ,The Scarlet Letter
yea forsooth replied the bondservant staring with wideopen eyes at the scarlet letter which being a newcomer in the country he had never before seen yea his honorable worship is within but he hath a godly minister or two with him and likewise a leech ye may not see his worship now ,The Scarlet Letter
nevertheless i will enter answered hester prynne and the bondservant perhaps judging from the decision of her air and the glittering symbol in her bosom that she was a great lady in the land offered no opposition ,The Scarlet Letter
so the mother and little pearl were admitted into the hall of entrance with many variations suggested by the nature of his buildingmaterials diversity of climate and a different mode of social life governor bellingham had planned his new habitation after the residences of gentlemen of fair estate in his native land here then was a wide and reasonably lofty hall extending through the whole depth of the house and forming a medium of general communication more or less directly with all the other apartments at one extremity this spacious room was lighted by the windows of the two towers which formed a small recess on either side of the portal at the other end though partly muffled by a curtain it was more powerfully illuminated by one of those embowed hallwindows which we read of in old books and which was provided with a deep and cushioned seat here on the cushion lay a folio tome probably of the chronicles of england or other such substantial literature even as in our own days we scatter gilded volumes on the centretable to be turned over by the casual guest the furniture of the hall consisted of some ponderous chairs the backs of which were elaborately carved with wreaths of oaken flowers and likewise a table in the same taste the whole being of the elizabethan age or perhaps earlier and heirlooms transferred hither from the governors paternal home on the tablein token that the sentiment of old english hospitality had not been left behindstood a large pewter tankard at the bottom of which had hester or pearl peeped into it they might have seen the frothy remnant of a recent draught of ale ,The Scarlet Letter
on the wall hung a row of portraits representing the forefathers of the bellingham lineage some with armor on their breasts and others with stately ruffs and robes of peace all were characterized by the sternness and severity which old portraits so invariably put on as if they were the ghosts rather than the pictures of departed worthies and were gazing with harsh and intolerant criticism at the pursuits and enjoyments of living men ,The Scarlet Letter
at about the centre of the oaken panels that lined the hall was suspended a suit of mail not like the pictures an ancestral relic but of the most modern date for it had been manufactured by a skilful armorer in london the same year in which governor bellingham came over to new england there was a steel headpiece a cuirass a gorget and greaves with a pair of gauntlets and a sword hanging beneath all and especially the helmet and breastplate so highly burnished as to glow with white radiance and scatter an illumination everywhere about upon the floor this bright panoply was not meant for mere idle show but had been worn by the governor on many a solemn muster and training field and had glittered moreover at the head of a regiment in the pequod war for though bred a lawyer and accustomed to speak of bacon coke noye and finch as his professional associates the exigencies of this new country had transformed governor bellingham into a soldier as well as a statesman and ruler ,The Scarlet Letter
hester looked by way of humoring the child and she saw that owing to the peculiar effect of this convex mirror the scarlet letter was represented in exaggerated and gigantic proportions so as to be greatly the most prominent feature of her appearance in truth she seemed absolutely hidden behind it pearl pointed upward also at a similar picture in the headpiece smiling at her mother with the elfish intelligence that was so familiar an expression on her small physiognomy that look of naughty merriment was likewise reflected in the mirror with so much breadth and intensity of effect that it made hester prynne feel as if it could not be the image of her own child but of an imp who was seeking to mould itself into pearls shape ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl accordingly ran to the bowwindow at the farther end of the hall and looked along the vista of a gardenwalk carpeted with closely shaven grass and bordered with some rude and immature attempt at shrubbery but the proprietor appeared already to have relinquished as hopeless the effort to perpetuate on this side of the atlantic in a hard soil and amid the close struggle for subsistence the native english taste for ornamental gardening cabbages grew in plain sight and a pumpkinvine rooted at some distance had run across the intervening space and deposited one of its gigantic products directly beneath the hallwindow as if to warn the governor that this great lump of vegetable gold was as rich an ornament as new england earth would offer him there were a few rosebushes however and a number of appletrees probably the descendants of those planted by the reverend mr blackstone the first settler of the peninsula that halfmythological personage who rides through our early annals seated on the back of a bull ,The Scarlet Letter
in fact adown the vista of the garden avenue a number of persons were seen approaching towards the house pearl in utter scorn of her mothers attempt to quiet her gave an eldritch scream and then became silent not from any notion of obedience but because the quick and mobile curiosity of her disposition was excited by the appearance of these new personages ,The Scarlet Letter
governor bellingham in a loose gown and easy capsuch as elderly gentlemen loved to endue themselves with in their domestic privacywalked foremost and appeared to be showing off his estate and expatiating on his projected improvements the wide circumference of an elaborate ruff beneath his gray beard in the antiquated fashion of king jamess reign caused his head to look not a little like that of john the baptist in a charger the impression made by his aspect so rigid and severe and frostbitten with more than autumnal age was hardly in keeping with the appliances of worldly enjoyment wherewith he had evidently done his utmost to surround himself but it is an error to suppose that our grave forefathersthough accustomed to speak and think of human existence as a state merely of trial and warfare and though unfeignedly prepared to sacrifice goods and life at the behest of dutymade it a matter of conscience to reject such means of comfort or even luxury as lay fairly within their grasp this creed was never taught for instance by the venerable pastor john wilson whose beard white as a snowdrift was seen over governor bellinghams shoulder while its wearer suggested that pears and peaches might yet be naturalized in the new england climate and that purple grapes might possibly be compelled to nourish against the sunny gardenwall the old clergyman nurtured at the rich bosom of the english church had a longestablished and legitimate taste for all good and comfortable things and however stern he might show himself in the pulpit or in his public reproof of such transgressions as that of hester prynne still the genial benevolence of his private life had won him warmer affection than was accorded to any of his professional contemporaries ,The Scarlet Letter
behind the governor and mr wilson came two other guests one the reverend arthur dimmesdale whom the reader may remember as having taken a brief and reluctant part in the scene of hester prynnes disgrace and in close companionship with him old roger chillingworth a person of great skill in physic who for two or three years past had been settled in the town it was understood that this learned man was the physician as well as friend of the young minister whose health had severely suffered of late by his too unreserved selfsacrifice to the labors and duties of the pastoral relation ,The Scarlet Letter
the governor in advance of his visitors ascended one or two steps and throwing open the leaves of the great hallwindow found himself close to little pearl the shadow of the curtain fell on hester prynne and partially concealed her ,The Scarlet Letter
what have we here said governor bellingham looking with surprise at the scarlet little figure before him i profess i have never seen the like since my days of vanity in old king jamess time when i was wont to esteem it a high favor to be admitted to a court mask there used to be a swarm of these small apparitions in holiday time and we called them children of the lord of misrule but how gat such a guest into my hall ,The Scarlet Letter
ay indeed cried good old mr wilson what little bird of scarlet plumage may this be methinks i have seen just such figures when the sun has been shining through a richly painted window and tracing out the golden and crimson images across the floor but that was in the old land prithee young one who art thou and what has ailed thy mother to bedizen thee in this strange fashion art thou a christian childha dost know thy catechism or art thou one of those naughty elfs or fairies whom we thought to have left behind us with other relics of papistry in merry old england ,The Scarlet Letter
pearlruby ratheror coralor red rose at the very least judging from thy hue responded the old minister putting forth his hand in a vain attempt to pat little pearl on the cheek but where is this mother of thine ah i see he added and turning to governor bellingham whispered this is the selfsame child of whom we have held speech together and behold here the unhappy woman hester prynne her mother ,The Scarlet Letter
sayest thou so cried the governor nay we might have judged that such a childs mother must needs be a scarlet woman and a worthy type of her of babylon but she comes at a good time and we will look into this matter forthwith ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne said he fixing his naturally stern regard on the wearer of the scarlet letter there hath been much question concerning thee of late the point hath been weightily discussed whether we that are of authority and influence do well discharge our consciences by trusting an immortal soul such as there is in yonder child to the guidance of one who hath stumbled and fallen amid the pitfalls of this world speak thou the childs own mother were it not thinkest thou for thy little ones temporal and eternal welfare that she be taken out of thy charge and clad soberly and disciplined strictly and instructed in the truths of heaven and earth what canst thou do for the child in this kind ,The Scarlet Letter
nevertheless said the mother calmly though growing more pale this badge hath taught meit daily teaches meit is teaching me at this momentlessons whereof my child may be the wiser and better albeit they can profit nothing to myself ,The Scarlet Letter
we will judge warily said bellingham and look well what we are about to do good master wilson i pray you examine this pearlsince that is her nameand see whether she hath had such christian nurture as befits a child of her age ,The Scarlet Letter
the old minister seated himself in an armchair and made an effort to draw pearl betwixt his knees but the child unaccustomed to the touch or familiarity of any but her mother escaped through the open window and stood on the upper step looking like a wild tropical bird of rich plumage ready to take flight into the upper air mr wilson not a little astonished at this outbreakfor he was a grandfatherly sort of personage and usually a vast favorite with childrenessayed however to proceed with the examination ,The Scarlet Letter
now pearl knew well enough who made her for hester prynne the daughter of a pious home very soon after her talk with the child about her heavenly father had begun to inform her of those truths which the human spirit at whatever stage of immaturity imbibes with such eager interest pearl therefore so large were the attainments of her three years lifetime could have borne a fair examination in the new england primer or the first column of the westminster catechisms although unacquainted with the outward form of either of those celebrated works but that perversity which all children have more or less of and of which little pearl had a tenfold portion now at the most inopportune moment took thorough possession of her and closed her lips or impelled her to speak words amiss after putting her finger in her mouth with many ungracious refusals to answer good mr wilsons question the child finally announced that she had not been made at all but had been plucked by her mother off the bush of wild roses that grew by the prisondoor ,The Scarlet Letter
this fantasy was probably suggested by the near proximity of the governors red roses as pearl stood outside of the window together with her recollection of the prison rosebush which she had passed in coming hither ,The Scarlet Letter
old roger chillingworth with a smile on his face whispered something in the young clergymans ear hester prynne looked at the man of skill and even then with her fate hanging in the balance was startled to perceive what a change had come over his featureshow much uglier they werehow his dark complexion seemed to have grown duskier and his figure more misshapensince the days when she had familiarly known him she met his eyes for an instant but was immediately constrained to give all her attention to the scene now going forward ,The Scarlet Letter
this is awful cried the governor slowly recovering from the astonishment into which pearls response had thrown him here is a child of three years old and she cannot tell who made her without question she is equally in the dark as to her soul its present depravity and future destiny methinks gentlemen we need inquire no further ,The Scarlet Letter
hester caught hold of pearl and drew her forcibly into her arms confronting the old puritan magistrate with almost a fierce expression alone in the world cast off by it and with this sole treasure to keep her heart alive she felt that she possessed indefeasible rights against the world and was ready to defend them to the death ,The Scarlet Letter
god gave me the child cried she he gave her in requital of all things else which ye had taken from me she is my happinessshe is my torture none the less pearl keeps me here in life pearl punishes me too see ye not she is the scarlet letter only capable of being loved and so endowed with a millionfold the power of retribution for my sin ye shall not take her i will die first ,The Scarlet Letter
god gave her into my keeping repeated hester prynne raising her voice almost to a shriek i will not give her upand here by a sudden impulse she turned to the young clergyman mr dimmesdale at whom up to this moment she had seemed hardly so much as once to direct her eyesspeak thou for me cried she thou wast my pastor and hadst charge of my soul and knowest me better than these men can i will not lose the child speak for me thou knowestfor thou hast sympathies which these men lackthou knowest what is in my heart and what are a mothers rights and how much the stronger they are when that mother has but her child and the scarlet letter look thou to it i will not lose the child look to it ,The Scarlet Letter
at this wild and singular appeal which indicated that hester prynnes situation had provoked her to little less than madness the young minister at once came forward pale and holding his hand over his heart as was his custom whenever his peculiarly nervous temperament was thrown into agitation he looked now more careworn and emaciated than as we described him at the scene of hesters public ignominy and whether it were his failing health or whatever the cause might be his large dark eyes had a world of pain in their troubled and melancholy depth ,The Scarlet Letter
there is truth in what she says began the minister with a voice sweet tremulous but powerful insomuch that the hall reechoed and the hollow armor rang with ittruth in what hester says and in the feeling which inspires her god gave her the child and gave her too an instinctive knowledge of its nature and requirementsboth seemingly so peculiarwhich no other mortal being can possess and moreover is there not a quality of awful sacredness in the relation between this mother and this child ,The Scarlet Letter
it must be even so resumed the minister for if we deem it otherwise do we not thereby say that the heavenly father the creator of all flesh hath lightly recognized a deed of sin and made of no account the distinction between unhallowed lust and holy love this child of its fathers guilt and its mothers shame hath come from the hand of god to work in many ways upon her heart who pleads so earnestly and with such bitterness of spirit the right to keep her it was meant for a blessing for the one blessing of her life it was meant doubtless as the mother herself hath told us for a retribution too a torture to be felt at many an unthoughtof moment a pang a sting an everrecurring agony in the midst of a troubled joy hath she not expressed this thought in the garb of the poor child so forcibly reminding us of that red symbol which sears her bosom ,The Scarlet Letter
o not sonot so continued mr dimmesdale she recognizes believe me the solemn miracle which god hath wrought in the existence of that child and may she feel toowhat methinks is the very truththat this boon was meant above all things else to keep the mothers soul alive and to preserve her from blacker depths of sin into which satan might else have sought to plunge her therefore it is good for this poor sinful woman that she hath an infant immortality a being capable of eternal joy or sorrow confided to her careto be trained up by her to righteousnessto remind her at every moment of her fallbut yet to teach her as it were by the creators sacred pledge that if she bring the child to heaven the child also will bring its parent thither herein is the sinful mother happier than the sinful father for hester prynnes sake then and no less for the poor childs sake let us leave them as providence hath seen fit to place them ,The Scarlet Letter
indeed hath he answered the magistrate and hath adduced such arguments that we will even leave the matter as it now stands so long at least as there shall be no further scandal in the woman care must be had nevertheless to put the child to due and stated examination in the catechism at thy hands or master dimmesdales moreover at a proper season the tithingmen must take heed that she go both to school and to meeting ,The Scarlet Letter
the young minister on ceasing to speak had withdrawn a few steps from the group and stood with his face partially concealed in the heavy folds of the windowcurtain while the shadow of his figure which the sunlight cast upon the floor was tremulous with the vehemence of his appeal pearl that wild and flighty little elf stole softly towards him and taking his hand in the grasp of both her own laid her cheek against it a caress so tender and withal so unobtrusive that her mother who was looking on asked herselfis that my pearl yet she knew that there was love in the childs heart although it mostly revealed itself in passion and hardly twice in her lifetime had been softened by such gentleness as now the ministerfor save the longsought regards of woman nothing is sweeter than these marks of childish preference accorded spontaneously by a spiritual instinct and therefore seeming to imply in us something truly worthy to be lovedthe minister looked round laid his hand on the childs head hesitated an instant and then kissed her brow little pearls unwonted mood of sentiment lasted no longer she laughed and went capering down the hall so airily that old mr wilson raised a question whether even her tiptoes touched the floor ,The Scarlet Letter
a strange child remarked old roger chillingworth it is easy to see the mothers part in her would it be beyond a philosophers research think ye gentlemen to analyze that childs nature and from its make and mould to give a shrewd guess at the father ,The Scarlet Letter
nay it would be sinful in such a question to follow the clew of profane philosophy said mr wilson better to fast and pray upon it and still better it may be to leave the mystery as we find it unless providence reveal it of its own accord thereby every good christian man hath a title to show a fathers kindness towards the poor deserted babe ,The Scarlet Letter
the affair being so satisfactorily concluded hester prynne with pearl departed from the house as they descended the steps it is averred that the lattice of a chamberwindow was thrown open and forth into the sunny day was thrust the face of mistress hibbins governor bellinghams bittertempered sister and the same who a few years later was executed as a witch ,The Scarlet Letter
hist hist said she while her illomened physiognomy seemed to cast a shadow over the cheerful newness of the house wilt thou go with us tonight there will be a merry company in the forest and i wellnigh promised the black man that comely hester prynne should make one ,The Scarlet Letter
make my excuse to him so please you answered hester with a triumphant smile i must tarry at home and keep watch over my little pearl had they taken her from me i would willingly have gone with thee into the forest and signed my name in the black mans book too and that with mine own blood ,The Scarlet Letter
but hereif we suppose this interview betwixt mistress hibbins and hester prynne to be authentic and not a parablewas already an illustration of the young ministers argument against sundering the relation of a fallen mother to the offspring of her frailty even thus early had the child saved her from satans snare ,The Scarlet Letter
under the appellation of roger chillingworth the reader will remember was hidden another name which its former wearer had resolved should never more be spoken it has been related how in the crowd that witnessed hester prynnes ignominious exposure stood a man elderly travelworn who just emerging from the perilous wilderness beheld the woman in whom he hoped to find embodied the warmth and cheerfulness of home set up as a type of sin before the people her matronly fame was trodden under all mens feet infamy was babbling around her in the public marketplace for her kindred should the tidings ever reach them and for the companions of her unspotted life there remained nothing but the contagion of her dishonor which would not fail to be distributed in strict accordance and proportion with the intimacy and sacredness of their previous relationship then whysince the choice was with himselfshould the individual whose connection with the fallen woman had been the most intimate and sacred of them all come forward to vindicate his claim to an inheritance so little desirable he resolved not to be pilloried beside her on her pedestal of shame unknown to all but hester prynne and possessing the lock and key of her silence he chose to withdraw his name from the roll of mankind and as regarded his former ties and interests to vanish out of life as completely as if he indeed lay at the bottom of the ocean whither rumor had long ago consigned him this purpose once effected new interests would immediately spring up and likewise a new purpose dark it is true if not guilty but of force enough to engage the full strength of his faculties ,The Scarlet Letter
in pursuance of this resolve he took up his residence in the puritan town as roger chillingworth without other introduction than the learning and intelligence of which he possessed more than a common measure as his studies at a previous period of his life had made him extensively acquainted with the medical science of the day it was as a physician that he presented himself and as such was cordially received skilful men of the medical and chirurgical profession were of rare occurrence in the colony they seldom it would appear partook of the religious zeal that brought other emigrants across the atlantic in their researches into the human frame it may be that the higher and more subtile faculties of such men were materialized and that they lost the spiritual view of existence amid the intricacies of that wondrous mechanism which seemed to involve art enough to comprise all of life within itself at all events the health of the good town of boston so far as medicine had aught to do with it had hitherto lain in the guardianship of an aged deacon and apothecary whose piety and godly deportment were stronger testimonials in his favor than any that he could have produced in the shape of a diploma the only surgeon was one who combined the occasional exercise of that noble art with the daily and habitual flourish of a razor to such a professional body roger chillingworth was a brilliant acquisition he soon manifested his familiarity with the ponderous and imposing machinery of antique physic in which every remedy contained a multitude of farfetched and heterogeneous ingredients as elaborately compounded as if the proposed result had been the elixir of life in his indian captivity moreover he had gained much knowledge of the properties of native herbs and roots nor did he conceal from his patients that these simple medicines natures boon to the untutored savage had quite as large a share of his own confidence as the european pharmacopia which so many learned doctors had spent centuries in elaborating ,The Scarlet Letter
this learned stranger was exemplary as regarded at least the outward forms of a religious life and early after his arrival had chosen for his spiritual guide the reverend mr dimmesdale the young divine whose scholarlike renown still lived in oxford was considered by his more fervent admirers as little less than a heavenordained apostle destined should he live and labor for the ordinary term of life to do as great deeds for the now feeble new england church as the early fathers had achieved for the infancy of the christian faith about this period however the health of mr dimmesdale had evidently begun to fail by those best acquainted with his habits the paleness of the young ministers cheek was accounted for by his too earnest devotion to study his scrupulous fulfilment of parochial duty and more than all by the fasts and vigils of which he made a frequent practice in order to keep the grossness of this earthly state from clogging and obscuring his spiritual lamp some declared that if mr dimmesdale were really going to die it was cause enough that the world was not worthy to be any longer trodden by his feet he himself on the other hand with characteristic humility avowed his belief that if providence should see fit to remove him it would be because of his own unworthiness to perform its humblest mission here on earth with all this difference of opinion as to the cause of his decline there could be no question of the fact his form grew emaciated his voice though still rich and sweet had a certain melancholy prophecy of decay in it he was often observed on any slight alarm or other sudden accident to put his hand over his heart with first a flush and then a paleness indicative of pain ,The Scarlet Letter
such was the young clergymans condition and so imminent the prospect that his dawning light would be extinguished all untimely when roger chillingworth made his advent to the town his first entry on the scene few people could tell whence dropping down as it were out of the sky or starting from the nether earth had an aspect of mystery which was easily heightened to the miraculous he was now known to be a man of skill it was observed that he gathered herbs and the blossoms of wildflowers and dug up roots and plucked off twigs from the foresttrees like one acquainted with hidden virtues in what was valueless to common eyes he was heard to speak of sir kenelm digby and other famous menwhose scientific attainments were esteemed hardly less than supernaturalas having been his correspondents or associates why with such rank in the learned world had he come hither what could he whose sphere was in great cities be seeking in the wilderness in answer to this query a rumor gained groundand however absurd was entertained by some very sensible peoplethat heaven had wrought an absolute miracle by transporting an eminent doctor of physic from a german university bodily through the air and setting him down at the door of mr dimmesdales study individuals of wiser faith indeed who knew that heaven promotes its purposes without aiming at the stageeffect of what is called miraculous interposition were inclined to see a providential hand in roger chillingworths so opportune arrival ,The Scarlet Letter
this idea was countenanced by the strong interest which the physician ever manifested in the young clergyman he attached himself to him as a parishioner and sought to win a friendly regard and confidence from his naturally reserved sensibility he expressed great alarm at his pastors state of health but was anxious to attempt the cure and if early undertaken seemed not despondent of a favorable result the elders the deacons the motherly dames and the young and fair maidens of mr dimmesdales flock were alike importunate that he should make trial of the physicians frankly offered skill mr dimmesdale gently repelled their entreaties ,The Scarlet Letter
but how could the young minister say so when with every successive sabbath his cheek was paler and thinner and his voice more tremulous than beforewhen it had now become a constant habit rather than a casual gesture to press his hand over his heart was he weary of his labors did he wish to die these questions were solemnly propounded to mr dimmesdale by the elder ministers of boston and the deacons of his church who to use their own phrase dealt with him on the sin of rejecting the aid which providence so manifestly held out he listened in silence and finally promised to confer with the physician ,The Scarlet Letter
were it gods will said the reverend mr dimmesdale when in fulfilment of this pledge he requested old roger chillingworths professional advice i could be well content that my labors and my sorrows and my sins and my pains should shortly end with me and what is earthly of them be buried in my grave and the spiritual go with me to my eternal state rather than that you should put your skill to the proof in my behalf ,The Scarlet Letter
ah replied roger chillingworth with that quietness which whether imposed or natural marked all his deportment it is thus that a young clergyman is apt to speak youthful men not having taken a deep root give up their hold of life so easily and saintly men who walk with god on earth would fain be away to walk with him on the golden pavements of the new jerusalem ,The Scarlet Letter
in this manner the mysterious old roger chillingworth became the medical adviser of the reverend mr dimmesdale as not only the disease interested the physician but he was strongly moved to look into the character and qualities of the patient these two men so different in age came gradually to spend much time together for the sake of the ministers health and to enable the leech to gather plants with healing balm in them they took long walks on the seashore or in the forest mingling various talk with the plash and murmur of the waves and the solemn windanthem among the treetops often likewise one was the guest of the other in his place of study and retirement there was a fascination for the minister in the company of the man of science in whom he recognized an intellectual cultivation of no moderate depth or scope together with a range and freedom of ideas that he would have vainly looked for among the members of his own profession in truth he was startled if not shocked to find this attribute in the physician mr dimmesdale was a true priest a true religionist with the reverential sentiment largely developed and an order of mind that impelled itself powerfully along the track of a creed and wore its passage continually deeper with the lapse of time in no state of society would he have been what is called a man of liberal views it would always be essential to his peace to feel the pressure of a faith about him supporting while it confined him within its iron framework not the less however though with a tremulous enjoyment did he feel the occasional relief of looking at the universe through the medium of another kind of intellect than those with which he habitually held converse it was as if a window were thrown open admitting a freer atmosphere into the close and stifled study where his life was wasting itself away amid lamplight or obstructed daybeams and the musty fragrance be it sensual or moral that exhales from books but the air was too fresh and chill to be long breathed with comfort so the minister and the physician with him withdrew again within the limits of what their church defined as orthodox ,The Scarlet Letter
thus roger chillingworth scrutinized his patient carefully both as he saw him in his ordinary life keeping an accustomed pathway in the range of thoughts familiar to him and as he appeared when thrown amidst other moral scenery the novelty of which might call out something new to the surface of his character he deemed it essential it would seem to know the man before attempting to do him good wherever there is a heart and an intellect the diseases of the physical frame are tinged with the peculiarities of these in arthur dimmesdale thought and imagination were so active and sensibility so intense that the bodily infirmity would be likely to have its groundwork there so roger chillingworththe man of skill the kind and friendly physicianstrove to go deep into his patients bosom delving among his principles prying into his recollections and probing everything with a cautious touch like a treasureseeker in a dark cavern few secrets can escape an investigator who has opportunity and license to undertake such a quest and skill to follow it up a man burdened with a secret should especially avoid the intimacy of his physician if the latter possess native sagacity and a nameless something morelet us call it intuition if he show no intrusive egotism nor disagreeably prominent characteristics of his own if he have the power which must be born with him to bring his mind into such affinity with his patients that this last shall unawares have spoken what he imagines himself only to have thought if such revelations be received without tumult and acknowledged not so often by an uttered sympathy as by silence an inarticulate breath and here and there a word to indicate that all is understood if to these qualifications of a confidant be joined the advantages afforded by his recognized character as a physicianthen at some inevitable moment will the soul of the sufferer be dissolved and flow forth in a dark but transparent stream bringing all its mysteries into the daylight ,The Scarlet Letter
roger chillingworth possessed all or most of the attributes above enumerated nevertheless time went on a kind of intimacy as we have said grew up between these two cultivated minds which had as wide a field as the whole sphere of human thought and study to meet upon they discussed every topic of ethics and religion of public affairs and private character they talked much on both sides of matters that seemed personal to themselves and yet no secret such as the physician fancied must exist there ever stole out of the ministers consciousness into his companions ear the latter had his suspicions indeed that even the nature of mr dimmesdales bodily disease had never fairly been revealed to him it was a strange reserve ,The Scarlet Letter
after a time at a hint from roger chillingworth the friends of mr dimmesdale effected an arrangement by which the two were lodged in the same house so that every ebb and flow of the ministers lifetide might pass under the eye of his anxious and attached physician there was much joy throughout the town when this greatly desirable object was attained it was held to be the best possible measure for the young clergymans welfare unless indeed as often urged by such as felt authorized to do so he had selected some one of the many blooming damsels spiritually devoted to him to become his devoted wife this latter step however there was no present prospect that arthur dimmesdale would be prevailed upon to take he rejected all suggestions of the kind as if priestly celibacy were one of his articles of churchdiscipline doomed by his own choice therefore as mr dimmesdale so evidently was to eat his unsavory morsel always at anothers board and endure the lifelong chill which must be his lot who seeks to warm himself only at anothers fireside it truly seemed that this sagacious experienced benevolent old physician with his concord of paternal and reverential love for the young pastor was the very man of all mankind to be constantly within reach of his voice ,The Scarlet Letter
the new abode of the two friends was with a pious widow of good social rank who dwelt in a house covering pretty nearly the site on which the venerable structure of kings chapel has since been built it had the graveyard originally isaac johnsons homefield on one side and so was well adapted to call up serious reflections suited to their respective employments in both minister and man of physic the motherly care of the good widow assigned to mr dimmesdale a front apartment with a sunny exposure and heavy windowcurtains to create a noontide shadow when desirable the walls were hung round with tapestry said to be from the gobelin looms and at all events representing the scriptural story of david and bathsheba and nathan the prophet in colors still unfaded but which made the fair woman of the scene almost as grimly picturesque as the woedenouncing seer here the pale clergyman piled up his library rich with parchmentbound folios of the fathers and the lore of rabbis and monkish erudition of which the protestant divines even while they vilified and decried that class of writers were yet constrained often to avail themselves on the other side of the house old roger chillingworth arranged his study and laboratory not such as a modern man of science would reckon even tolerably complete but provided with a distilling apparatus and the means of compounding drugs and chemicals which the practised alchemist knew well how to turn to purpose with such commodiousness of situation these two learned persons sat themselves down each in his own domain yet familiarly passing from one apartment to the other and bestowing a mutual and not incurious inspection into one anothers business ,The Scarlet Letter
and the reverend arthur dimmesdales best discerning friends as we have intimated very reasonably imagined that the hand of providence had done all this for the purposebesought in so many public and domestic and secret prayersof restoring the young minister to health butit must now be saidanother portion of the community had latterly begun to take its own view of the relation betwixt mr dimmesdale and the mysterious old physician when an uninstructed multitude attempts to see with its eyes it is exceedingly apt to be deceived when however it forms its judgment as it usually does on the intuitions of its great and warm heart the conclusions thus attained are often so profound and so unerring as to possess the character of truths supernaturally revealed the people in the case of which we speak could justify its prejudice against roger chillingworth by no fact or argument worthy of serious refutation there was an aged handicraftsman it is true who had been a citizen of london at the period of sir thomas overburys murder now some thirty years agone he testified to having seen the physician under some other name which the narrator of the story had now forgotten in company with doctor forman the famous old conjurer who was implicated in the affair of overbury two or three individuals hinted that the man of skill during his indian captivity had enlarged his medical attainments by joining in the incantations of the savage priests who were universally acknowledged to be powerful enchanters often performing seemingly miraculous cures by their skill in the black art a large numberand many of these were persons of such sober sense and practical observation that their opinions would have been valuable in other mattersaffirmed that roger chillingworths aspect had undergone a remarkable change while he had dwelt in town and especially since his abode with mr dimmesdale at first his expression had been calm meditative scholarlike now there was something ugly and evil in his face which they had not previously noticed and which grew still the more obvious to sight the oftener they looked upon him according to the vulgar idea the fire in his laboratory had been brought from the lower regions and was fed with infernal fuel and so as might be expected his visage was getting sooty with the smoke ,The Scarlet Letter
to sum up the matter it grew to be a widely diffused opinion that the reverend arthur dimmesdale like many other personages of especial sanctity in all ages of the christian world was haunted either by satan himself or satans emissary in the guise of old roger chillingworth this diabolical agent had the divine permission for a season to burrow into the clergymans intimacy and plot against his soul no sensible man it was confessed could doubt on which side the victory would turn the people looked with an unshaken hope to see the minister come forth out of the conflict transfigured with the glory which he would unquestionably win meanwhile nevertheless it was sad to think of the perchance mortal agony through which he must struggle towards his triumph ,The Scarlet Letter
old roger chillingworth throughout life had been calm in temperament kindly though not of warm affections but ever and in all his relations with the world a pure and upright man he had begun an investigation as he imagined with the severe and equal integrity of a judge desirous only of truth even as if the question involved no more than the airdrawn lines and figures of a geometrical problem instead of human passions and wrongs inflicted on himself but as he proceeded a terrible fascination a kind of fierce though still calm necessity seized the old man within its gripe and never set him free again until he had done all its bidding he now dug into the poor clergymans heart like a miner searching for gold or rather like a sexton delving into a grave possibly in quest of a jewel that had been buried on the dead mans bosom but likely to find nothing save mortality and corruption alas for his own soul if these were what he sought ,The Scarlet Letter
sometimes a light glimmered out of the physicians eyes burning blue and ominous like the reflection of a furnace or let us say like one of those gleams of ghastly fire that darted from bunyans awful doorway in the hillside and quivered on the pilgrims face the soil where this dark miner was working had perchance shown indications that encouraged him ,The Scarlet Letter
this man said he at one such moment to himself pure as they deem himall spiritual as he seemshath inherited a strong animal nature from his father or his mother let us dig a little further in the direction of this vein ,The Scarlet Letter
then after long search into the ministers dim interior and turning over many precious materials in the shape of high aspirations for the welfare of his race warm love of souls pure sentiments natural piety strengthened by thought and study and illuminated by revelationall of which invaluable gold was perhaps no better than rubbish to the seekerhe would turn back discouraged and begin his quest towards another point he groped along as stealthily with as cautious a tread and as wary an outlook as a thief entering a chamber where a man lies only half asleepor it may be broad awakewith purpose to steal the very treasure which this man guards as the apple of his eye in spite of his premeditated carefulness the floor would now and then creak his garments would rustle the shadow of his presence in a forbidden proximity would be thrown across his victim in other words mr dimmesdale whose sensibility of nerve often produced the effect of spiritual intuition would become vaguely aware that something inimical to his peace had thrust itself into relation with him but old roger chillingworth too had perceptions that were almost intuitive and when the minister threw his startled eyes towards him there the physician sat his kind watchful sympathizing but never intrusive friend ,The Scarlet Letter
yet mr dimmesdale would perhaps have seen this individuals character more perfectly if a certain morbidness to which sick hearts are liable had not rendered him suspicious of all mankind trusting no man as his friend he could not recognize his enemy when the latter actually appeared he therefore still kept up a familiar intercourse with him daily receiving the old physician in his study or visiting the laboratory and for recreations sake watching the processes by which weeds were converted into drugs of potency ,The Scarlet Letter
one day leaning his forehead on his hand and his elbow on the sill of the open window that looked towards the graveyard he talked with roger chillingworth while the old man was examining a bundle of unsightly plants ,The Scarlet Letter
where asked he with a look askance at themfor it was the clergymans peculiarity that he seldom nowadays looked straightforth at any object whether human or inanimatewhere my kind doctor did you gather those herbs with such a dark flabby leaf ,The Scarlet Letter
even in the graveyard here at hand answered the physician continuing his employment they are new to me i found them growing on a grave which bore no tombstone nor other memorial of the dead man save these ugly weeds that have taken upon themselves to keep him in remembrance they grew out of his heart and typify it may be some hideous secret that was buried with him and which he had done better to confess during his lifetime ,The Scarlet Letter
and wherefore rejoined the physician wherefore not since all the powers of nature call so earnestly for the confession of sin that these black weeds have sprung up out of a buried heart to make manifest an unspoken crime ,The Scarlet Letter
that good sir is but a fantasy of yours replied the minister there can be if i forebode aright no power short of the divine mercy to disclose whether by uttered words or by type or emblem the secrets that may be buried with a human heart the heart making itself guilty of such secrets must perforce hold them until the day when all hidden things shall be revealed nor have i so read or interpreted holy writ as to understand that the disclosure of human thoughts and deeds then to be made is intended as a part of the retribution that surely were a shallow view of it no these revelations unless i greatly err are meant merely to promote the intellectual satisfaction of all intelligent beings who will stand waiting on that day to see the dark problem of this life made plain a knowledge of mens hearts will be needful to the completest solution of that problem and i conceive moreover that the hearts holding such miserable secrets as you speak of will yield them up at that last day not with reluctance but with a joy unutterable ,The Scarlet Letter
they mostly do said the clergyman griping hard at his breast as if afflicted with an importunate throb of pain many many a poor soul hath given its confidence to me not only on the deathbed but while strong in life and fair in reputation and ever after such an outpouring o what a relief have i witnessed in those sinful brethren even as in one who at last draws free air after long stifling with his own polluted breath how can it be otherwise why should a wretched man guilty we will say of murder prefer to keep the dead corpse buried in his own heart rather than fling it forth at once and let the universe take care of it ,The Scarlet Letter
true there are such men answered mr dimmesdale but not to suggest more obvious reasons it may be that they are kept silent by the very constitution of their nature orcan we not suppose itguilty as they may be retaining nevertheless a zeal for gods glory and mans welfare they shrink from displaying themselves black and filthy in the view of men because thenceforward no good can be achieved by them no evil of the past be redeemed by better service so to their own unutterable torment they go about among their fellowcreatures looking pure as newfallen snow while their hearts are all speckled and spotted with iniquity of which they cannot rid themselves ,The Scarlet Letter
these men deceive themselves said roger chillingworth with somewhat more emphasis than usual and making a slight gesture with his forefinger they fear to take up the shame that rightfully belongs to them their love for man their zeal for gods servicethese holy impulses may or may not coexist in their hearts with the evil inmates to which their guilt has unbarred the door and which must needs propagate a hellish breed within them but if they seek to glorify god let them not lift heavenward their unclean hands if they would serve their fellowmen let them do it by making manifest the power and reality of conscience in constraining them to penitential selfabasement wouldst thou have me to believe o wise and pious friend that a false show can be bettercan be more for gods glory or mans welfarethan gods own truth trust me such men deceive themselves ,The Scarlet Letter
it may be so said the young clergyman indifferently as waiving a discussion that he considered irrelevant or unseasonable he had a ready faculty indeed of escaping from any topic that agitated his too sensitive and nervous temperamentbut now i would ask of my wellskilled physician whether in good sooth he deems me to have profited by his kindly care of this weak frame of mine ,The Scarlet Letter
before roger chillingworth could answer they heard the clear wild laughter of a young childs voice proceeding from the adjacent burialground looking instinctively from the open windowfor it was summertimethe minister beheld hester prynne and little pearl passing along the footpath that traversed the enclosure pearl looked as beautiful as the day but was in one of those moods of perverse merriment which whenever they occurred seemed to remove her entirely out of the sphere of sympathy or human contact she now skipped irreverently from one grave to another until coming to the broad flat armorial tombstone of a departed worthyperhaps of isaac johnson himselfshe began to dance upon it in reply to her mothers command and entreaty that she would behave more decorously little pearl paused to gather the prickly burrs from a tall burdock which grew beside the tomb taking a handful of these she arranged them along the lines of the scarlet letter that decorated the maternal bosom to which the burrs as their nature was tenaciously adhered hester did not pluck them off ,The Scarlet Letter
there is no law nor reverence for authority no regard for human ordinances or opinions right or wrong mixed up with that childs composition remarked he as much to himself as to his companion i saw her the other day bespatter the governor himself with water at the cattletrough in spring lane what in heavens name is she is the imp altogether evil hath she affections hath she any discoverable principle of being ,The Scarlet Letter
the child probably overheard their voices for looking up to the window with a bright but naughty smile of mirth and intelligence she threw one of the prickly burrs at the reverend mr dimmesdale the sensitive clergyman shrunk with nervous dread from the light missile detecting his emotion pearl clapped her little hands in the most extravagant ecstasy hester prynne likewise had involuntarily looked up and all these four persons old and young regarded one another in silence till the child laughed aloud and shoutedcome away mother come away or yonder old black man will catch you he hath got hold of the minister already come away mother or he will catch you but he cannot catch little pearl ,The Scarlet Letter
so she drew her mother away skipping dancing and frisking fantastically among the hillocks of the dead people like a creature that had nothing in common with a bygone and buried generation nor owned herself akin to it it was as if she had been made afresh out of new elements and must perforce be permitted to live her own life and be a law unto herself without her eccentricities being reckoned to her for a crime ,The Scarlet Letter
there goes a woman resumed roger chillingworth after a pause who be her demerits what they may hath none of that mystery of hidden sinfulness which you deem so grievous to be borne is hester prynne the less miserable think you for that scarlet letter on her breast ,The Scarlet Letter
i do verily believe it answered the clergyman nevertheless i cannot answer for her there was a look of pain in her face which i would gladly have been spared the sight of but still methinks it must needs be better for the sufferer to be free to show his pain as this poor woman hester is than to cover it all up in his heart ,The Scarlet Letter
freely then and plainly said the physician still busy with his plants but keeping a wary eye on mr dimmesdale the disorder is a strange one not so much in itself nor as outwardly manifestedin so far at least as the symptoms have been laid open to my observation looking daily at you my good sir and watching the tokens of your aspect now for months gone by i should deem you a man sore sick it may be yet not so sick but that an instructed and watchful physician might well hope to cure you buti know not what to saythe disease is what i seem to know yet know it not ,The Scarlet Letter
then to speak more plainly continued the physician and i crave pardon sirshould it seem to require pardonfor this needful plainness of my speech let me askas your friendas one having charge under providence of your life and physical wellbeinghath all the operation of this disorder been fairly laid open and recounted to me ,The Scarlet Letter
you would tell me then that i know all said roger chillingworth deliberately and fixing an eye bright with intense and concentrated intelligence on the ministers face be it so but again he to whom only the outward and physical evil is laid open knoweth oftentimes but half the evil which he is called upon to cure a bodily disease which we look upon as whole and entire within itself may after all be but a symptom of some ailment in the spiritual part your pardon once again good sir if my speech give the shadow of offence you sir of all men whom i have known are he whose body is the closest conjoined and imbued and identified so to speak with the spirit whereof it is the instrument ,The Scarlet Letter
thus a sickness continued roger chillingworth going on in an unaltered tone without heeding the interruptionbut standing up and confronting the emaciated and whitecheeked minister with his low dark and misshapen figurea sickness a sore place if we may so call it in your spirit hath immediately its appropriate manifestation in your bodily frame would you therefore that your physician heal the bodily evil how may this be unless you first lay open to him the wound or trouble in your soul ,The Scarlet Letter
nonot to theenot to an earthly physician cried mr dimmesdale passionately and turning his eyes full and bright and with a kind of fierceness on old roger chillingworth not to thee but if it be the souls disease then do i commit myself to the one physician of the soul he if it stand with his good pleasure can cure or he can kill let him do with me as in his justice and wisdom he shall see good but who art thou that meddlest in this matterthat dares thrust himself between the sufferer and his god ,The Scarlet Letter
it is as well to have made this step said roger chillingworth to himself looking after the minister with a grave smile there is nothing lost we shall be friends again anon but see now how passion takes hold upon this man and hurrieth him out of himself as with one passion so with another he hath done a wild thing erenow this pious master dimmesdale in the hot passion of his heart ,The Scarlet Letter
it proved not difficult to reestablish the intimacy of the two companions on the same footing and in the same degree as heretofore the young clergyman after a few hours of privacy was sensible that the disorder of his nerves had hurried him into an unseemly outbreak of temper which there had been nothing in the physicians words to excuse or palliate he marvelled indeed at the violence with which he had thrust back the kind old man when merely proffering the advice which it was his duty to bestow and which the minister himself had expressly sought with these remorseful feelings he lost no time in making the amplest apologies and besought his friend still to continue the care which if not successful in restoring him to health had in all probability been the means of prolonging his feeble existence to that hour roger chillingworth readily assented and went on with his medical supervision of the minister doing his best for him in all good faith but always quitting the patients apartment at the close of a professional interview with a mysterious and puzzled smile upon his lips this expression was invisible in mr dimmesdales presence but grew strongly evident as the physician crossed the threshold ,The Scarlet Letter
it came to pass not long after the scene above recorded that the reverend mr dimmesdale at noonday and entirely unawares fell into a deep deep slumber sitting in his chair with a large blackletter volume open before him on the table it must have been a work of vast ability in the somniferous school of literature the profound depth of the ministers repose was the more remarkable inasmuch as he was one of those persons whose sleep ordinarily is as light as fitful and as easily scared away as a small bird hopping on a twig to such an unwonted remoteness however had his spirit now withdrawn into itself that he stirred not in his chair when old roger chillingworth without any extraordinary precaution came into the room the physician advanced directly in front of his patient laid his hand upon his bosom and thrust aside the vestment that hitherto had always covered it even from the professional eye ,The Scarlet Letter
but with what a wild look of wonder joy and horror with what a ghastly rapture as it were too mighty to be expressed only by the eye and features and therefore bursting forth through the whole ugliness of his figure and making itself even riotously manifest by the extravagant gestures with which he threw up his arms towards the ceiling and stamped his foot upon the floor had a man seen old roger chillingworth at that moment of his ecstasy he would have had no need to ask how satan comports himself when a precious human soul is lost to heaven and won into his kingdom ,The Scarlet Letter
after the incident last described the intercourse between the clergyman and the physician though externally the same was really of another character than it had previously been the intellect of roger chillingworth had now a sufficiently plain path before it it was not indeed precisely that which he had laid out for himself to tread calm gentle passionless as he appeared there was yet we fear a quiet depth of malice hitherto latent but active now in this unfortunate old man which led him to imagine a more intimate revenge than any mortal had ever wreaked upon an enemy to make himself the one trusted friend to whom should be confided all the fear the remorse the agony the ineffectual repentance the backward rush of sinful thoughts expelled in vain all that guilty sorrow hidden from the world whose great heart would have pitied and forgiven to be revealed to him the pitiless to him the unforgiving all that dark treasure to be lavished on the very man to whom nothing else could so adequately pay the debt of vengeance ,The Scarlet Letter
the clergymans shy and sensitive reserve had balked this scheme roger chillingworth however was inclined to be hardly if at all less satisfied with the aspect of affairs which providenceusing the avenger and his victim for its own purposes and perchance pardoning where it seemed most to punishhad substituted for his black devices a revelation he could almost say had been granted to him it mattered little for his object whether celestial or from what other region by its aid in all the subsequent relations betwixt him and mr dimmesdale not merely the external presence but the very inmost soul of the latter seemed to be brought out before his eyes so that he could see and comprehend its every movement he became thenceforth not a spectator only but a chief actor in the poor ministers interior world he could play upon him as he chose would he arouse him with a throb of agony the victim was forever on the rack it needed only to know the spring that controlled the engineand the physician knew it well would he startle him with sudden fear as at the waving of a magicians wand uprose a grisly phantomuprose a thousand phantomsin many shapes of death or more awful shame all flocking round about the clergyman and pointing with their fingers at his breast ,The Scarlet Letter
all this was accomplished with a subtlety so perfect that the minister though he had constantly a dim perception of some evil influence watching over him could never gain a knowledge of its actual nature true he looked doubtfully fearfullyeven at times with horror and the bitterness of hatredat the deformed figure of the old physician his gestures his gait his grizzled beard his slightest and most indifferent acts the very fashion of his garments were odious in the clergymans sight a token implicitly to be relied on of a deeper antipathy in the breast of the latter than he was willing to acknowledge to himself for as it was impossible to assign a reason for such distrust and abhorrence so mr dimmesdale conscious that the poison of one morbid spot was infecting his hearts entire substance attributed all his presentiments to no other cause he took himself to task for his bad sympathies in reference to roger chillingworth disregarded the lesson that he should have drawn from them and did his best to root them out unable to accomplish this he nevertheless as a matter of principle continued his habits of social familiarity with the old man and thus gave him constant opportunities for perfecting the purpose to whichpoor forlorn creature that he was and more wretched than his victimthe avenger had devoted himself ,The Scarlet Letter
while thus suffering under bodily disease and gnawed and tortured by some black trouble of the soul and given over to the machinations of his deadliest enemy the reverend mr dimmesdale had achieved a brilliant popularity in his sacred office he won it indeed in great part by his sorrows his intellectual gifts his moral perceptions his power of experiencing and communicating emotion were kept in a state of preternatural activity by the prick and anguish of his daily life his fame though still on its upward slope already overshadowed the soberer reputations of his fellowclergymen eminent as several of them were there were scholars among them who had spent more years in acquiring abstruse lore connected with the divine profession than mr dimmesdale had lived and who might well therefore be more profoundly versed in such solid and valuable attainments than their youthful brother there were men too of a sturdier texture of mind than his and endowed with a far greater share of shrewd hard iron or granite understanding which duly mingled with a fair proportion of doctrinal ingredient constitutes a highly respectable efficacious and unamiable variety of the clerical species there were others again true saintly fathers whose faculties had been elaborated by weary toil among their books and by patient thought and etherealized moreover by spiritual communications with the better world into which their purity of life had almost introduced these holy personages with their garments of mortality still clinging to them all that they lacked was the gift that descended upon the chosen disciples at pentecost in tongues of flame symbolizing it would seem not the power of speech in foreign and unknown languages but that of addressing the whole human brotherhood in the hearts native language these fathers otherwise so apostolic lacked heavens last and rarest attestation of their office the tongue of flame they would have vainly soughthad they ever dreamed of seekingto express the highest truths through the humblest medium of familiar words and images their voices came down afar and indistinctly from the upper heights where they habitually dwelt ,The Scarlet Letter
not improbably it was to this latter class of men that mr dimmesdale by many of his traits of character naturally belonged to the high mountainpeaks of faith and sanctity he would have climbed had not the tendency been thwarted by the burden whatever it might be of crime or anguish beneath which it was his doom to totter it kept him down on a level with the lowest him the man of ethereal attributes whose voice the angels might else have listened to and answered but this very burden it was that gave him sympathies so intimate with the sinful brotherhood of mankind so that his heart vibrated in unison with theirs and received their pain into itself and sent its own throb of pain through a thousand other hearts in gushes of sad persuasive eloquence oftenest persuasive but sometimes terrible the people knew not the power that moved them thus they deemed the young clergyman a miracle of holiness they fancied him the mouthpiece of heavens messages of wisdom and rebuke and love in their eyes the very ground on which he trod was sanctified the virgins of his church grew pale around him victims of a passion so imbued with religious sentiment that they imagined it to be all religion and brought it openly in their white bosoms as their most acceptable sacrifice before the altar the aged members of his flock beholding mr dimmesdales frame so feeble while they were themselves so rugged in their infirmity believed that he would go heavenward before them and enjoined it upon their children that their old bones should be buried close to their young pastors holy grave and all this time perchance when poor mr dimmesdale was thinking of his grave he questioned with himself whether the grass would ever grow on it because an accursed thing must there be buried ,The Scarlet Letter
it is inconceivable the agony with which this public veneration tortured him it was his genuine impulse to adore the truth and to reckon all things shadowlike and utterly devoid of weight or value that had not its divine essence as the life within their life then what was hea substanceor the dimmest of all shadows he longed to speak out from his own pulpit at the full height of his voice and tell the people what he was i whom you behold in these black garments of the priesthoodi who ascend the sacred desk and turn my pale face heavenward taking upon myself to hold communion in your behalf with the most high omnisciencei in whose daily life you discern the sanctity of enochi whose footsteps as you suppose leave a gleam along my earthly track whereby the pilgrims that shall come after me may be guided to the regions of the blesti who have laid the hand of baptism upon your childreni who have breathed the parting prayer over your dying friends to whom the amen sounded faintly from a world which they had quittedi your pastor whom you so reverence and trust am utterly a pollution and a lie ,The Scarlet Letter
more than once mr dimmesdale had gone into the pulpit with a purpose never to come down its steps until he should have spoken words like the above more than once he had cleared his throat and drawn in the long deep and tremulous breath which when sent forth again would come burdened with the black secret of his soul more than oncenay more than a hundred timeshe had actually spoken spoken but how he had told his hearers that he was altogether vile a viler companion of the vilest the worst of sinners an abomination a thing of unimaginable iniquity and that the only wonder was that they did not see his wretched body shrivelled up before their eyes by the burning wrath of the almighty could there be plainer speech than this would not the people start up in their seats by a simultaneous impulse and tear him down out of the pulpit which he defiled not so indeed they heard it all and did but reverence him the more they little guessed what deadly purport lurked in those selfcondemning words the godly youth said they among themselves the saint on earth alas if he discern such sinfulness in his own white soul what horrid spectacle would he behold in thine or mine the minister well knewsubtle but remorseful hypocrite that he wasthe light in which his vague confession would be viewed he had striven to put a cheat upon himself by making the avowal of a guilty conscience but had gained only one other sin and a selfacknowledged shame without the momentary relief of being selfdeceived he had spoken the very truth and transformed it into the veriest falsehood and yet by the constitution of his nature he loved the truth and loathed the lie as few men ever did therefore above all things else he loathed his miserable self ,The Scarlet Letter
his inward trouble drove him to practices more in accordance with the old corrupted faith of rome than with the better light of the church in which he had been born and bred in mr dimmesdales secret closet under lock and key there was a bloody scourge oftentimes this protestant and puritan divine had plied it on his own shoulders laughing bitterly at himself the while and smiting so much the more pitilessly because of that bitter laugh it was his custom too as it has been that of many other pious puritans to fastnot however like them in order to purify the body and render it the fitter medium of celestial illumination but rigorously and until his knees trembled beneath him as an act of penance he kept vigils likewise night after night sometimes in utter darkness sometimes with a glimmering lamp and sometimes viewing his own face in a lookingglass by the most powerful light which he could throw upon it he thus typified the constant introspection wherewith he tortured but could not purify himself in these lengthened vigils his brain often reeled and visions seemed to flit before him perhaps seen doubtfully and by a faint light of their own in the remote dimness of the chamber or more vividly and close beside him within the lookingglass now it was a herd of diabolic shapes that grinned and mocked at the pale minister and beckoned him away with them now a group of shining angels who flew upward heavily as sorrowladen but grew more ethereal as they rose now came the dead friends of his youth and his whitebearded father with a saintlike frown and his mother turning her face away as she passed by ghost of a motherthinnest fantasy of a mothermethinks she might yet have thrown a pitying glance towards her son and now through the chamber which these spectral thoughts had made so ghastly glided hester prynne leading along little pearl in her scarlet garb and pointing her forefinger first at the scarlet letter on her bosom and then at the clergymans own breast ,The Scarlet Letter
none of these visions ever quite deluded him at any moment by an effort of his will he could discern substances through their misty lack of substance and convince himself that they were not solid in their nature like yonder table of carved oak or that big square leathernbound and brazenclasped volume of divinity but for all that they were in one sense the truest and most substantial things which the poor minister now dealt with it is the unspeakable misery of a life so false as his that it steals the pith and substance out of whatever realities there are around us and which were meant by heaven to be the spirits joy and nutriment to the untrue man the whole universe is falseit is impalpableit shrinks to nothing within his grasp and he himself in so far as he shows himself in a false light becomes a shadow or indeed ceases to exist the only truth that continued to give mr dimmesdale a real existence on this earth was the anguish in his inmost soul and the undissembled expression of it in his aspect had he once found power to smile and wear a face of gayety there would have been no such man ,The Scarlet Letter
on one of those ugly nights which we have faintly hinted at but forborne to picture forth the minister started from his chair a new thought had struck him there might be a moments peace in it attiring himself with as much care as if it had been for public worship and precisely in the same manner he stole softly down the staircase undid the door and issued forth ,The Scarlet Letter
walking in the shadow of a dream as it were and perhaps actually under the influence of a species of somnambulism mr dimmesdale reached the spot where now so long since hester prynne had lived through her first hours of public ignominy the same platform or scaffold black and weatherstained with the storm or sunshine of seven long years and footworn too with the tread of many culprits who had since ascended it remained standing beneath the balcony of the meetinghouse the minister went up the steps ,The Scarlet Letter
it was an obscure night of early may an unvaried pall of cloud muffled the whole expanse of sky from zenith to horizon if the same multitude which had stood as eyewitnesses while hester prynne sustained her punishment could now have been summoned forth they would have discerned no face above the platform nor hardly the outline of a human shape in the dark gray of the midnight but the town was all asleep there was no peril of discovery the minister might stand there if it so pleased him until morning should redden in the east without other risk than that the dank and chill nightair would creep into his frame and stiffen his joints with rheumatism and clog his throat with catarrh and cough thereby defrauding the expectant audience of tomorrows prayer and sermon no eye could see him save that everwakeful one which had seen him in his closet wielding the bloody scourge why then had he come hither was it but the mockery of penitence a mockery indeed but in which his soul trifled with itself a mockery at which angels blushed and wept while fiends rejoiced with jeering laughter he had been driven hither by the impulse of that remorse which dogged him everywhere and whose own sister and closely linked companion was that cowardice which invariably drew him back with her tremulous gripe just when the other impulse had hurried him to the verge of a disclosure poor miserable man what right had infirmity like his to burden itself with crime crime is for the ironnerved who have their choice either to endure it or if it press too hard to exert their fierce and savage strength for a good purpose and fling it off at once this feeble and most sensitive of spirits could do neither yet continually did one thing or another which intertwined in the same inextricable knot the agony of heavendefying guilt and vain repentance ,The Scarlet Letter
and thus while standing on the scaffold in this vain show of expiation mr dimmesdale was overcome with a great horror of mind as if the universe were gazing at a scarlet token on his naked breast right over his heart on that spot in very truth there was and there had long been the gnawing and poisonous tooth of bodily pain without any effort of his will or power to restrain himself he shrieked aloud an outcry that went pealing through the night and was beaten back from one house to another and reverberated from the hills in the background as if a company of devils detecting so much misery and terror in it had made a plaything of the sound and were bandying it to and fro ,The Scarlet Letter
but it was not so the shriek had perhaps sounded with a far greater power to his own startled ears than it actually possessed the town did not awake or if it did the drowsy slumberers mistook the cry either for something frightful in a dream or for the noise of witches whose voices at that period were often heard to pass over the settlements or lonely cottages as they rode with satan through the air the clergyman therefore hearing no symptoms of disturbance uncovered his eyes and looked about him at one of the chamberwindows of governor bellinghams mansion which stood at some distance on the line of another street he beheld the appearance of the old magistrate himself with a lamp in his hand a white nightcap on his head and a long white gown enveloping his figure he looked like a ghost evoked unseasonably from the grave the cry had evidently startled him at another window of the same house moreover appeared old mistress hibbins the governors sister also with a lamp which even thus far off revealed the expression of her sour and discontented face she thrust forth her head from the lattice and looked anxiously upward beyond the shadow of a doubt this venerable witchlady had heard mr dimmesdales outcry and interpreted it with its multitudinous echoes and reverberations as the clamor of the fiends and nighthags with whom she was well known to make excursions into the forest ,The Scarlet Letter
detecting the gleam of governor bellinghams lamp the old lady quickly extinguished her own and vanished possibly she went up among the clouds the minister saw nothing further of her motions the magistrate after a wary observation of the darknessinto which nevertheless he could see but little further than he might into a millstoneretired from the window ,The Scarlet Letter
the minister grew comparatively calm his eyes however were soon greeted by a little glimmering light which at first a long way off was approaching up the street it threw a gleam of recognition on here a post and there a gardenfence and here a latticed windowpane and there a pump with its full trough of water and here again an arched door of oak with an iron knocker and a rough log for the doorstep the reverend mr dimmesdale noted all these minute particulars even while firmly convinced that the doom of his existence was stealing onward in the footsteps which he now heard and that the gleam of the lantern would fall upon him in a few moments more and reveal his longhidden secret as the light drew nearer he beheld within its illuminated circle his brother clergymanor to speak more accurately his professional father as well as highly valued friendthe reverend mr wilson who as mr dimmesdale now conjectured had been praying at the bedside of some dying man and so he had the good old minister came freshly from the deathchamber of governor winthrop who had passed from earth to heaven within that very hour and now surrounded like the saintlike personages of olden times with a radiant halo that glorified him amid this gloomy night of sinas if the departed governor had left him an inheritance of his glory or as if he had caught upon himself the distant shine of the celestial city while looking thitherward to see the triumphant pilgrim pass within its gatesnow in short good father wilson was moving homeward aiding his footsteps with a lighted lantern the glimmer of this luminary suggested the above conceits to mr dimmesdale who smilednay almost laughed at themand then wondered if he were going mad ,The Scarlet Letter
as the reverend mr wilson passed beside the scaffold closely muffling his geneva cloak about him with one arm and holding the lantern before his breast with the other the minister could hardly restrain himself from speaking ,The Scarlet Letter
good heavens had mr dimmesdale actually spoken for one instant he believed that these words had passed his lips but they were uttered only within his imagination the venerable father wilson continued to step slowly onward looking carefully at the muddy pathway before his feet and never once turning his head towards the guilty platform when the light of the glimmering lantern had faded quite away the minister discovered by the faintness which came over him that the last few moments had been a crisis of terrible anxiety although his mind had made an involuntary effort to relieve itself by a kind of lurid playfulness ,The Scarlet Letter
shortly afterwards the like grisly sense of the humorous again stole in among the solemn phantoms of his thought he felt his limbs growing stiff with the unaccustomed chilliness of the night and doubted whether he should be able to descend the steps of the scaffold morning would break and find him there the neighborhood would begin to rouse itself the earliest riser coming forth in the dim twilight would perceive a vaguely defined figure aloft on the place of shame and half crazed betwixt alarm and curiosity would go knocking from door to door summoning all the people to behold the ghostas he needs must think itof some defunct transgressor a dusky tumult would flap its wings from one house to another thenthe morning light still waxing strongerold patriarchs would rise up in great haste each in his flannel gown and matronly dames without pausing to put off their nightgear the whole tribe of decorous personages who had never heretofore been seen with a single hair of their heads awry would start into public view with the disorder of a nightmare in their aspects old governor bellingham would come grimly forth with his king jamess ruff fastened askew and mistress hibbins with some twigs of the forest clinging to her skirts and looking sourer than ever as having hardly got a wink of sleep after her night ride and good father wilson too after spending half the night at a deathbed and liking ill to be disturbed thus early out of his dreams about the glorified saints hither likewise would come the elders and deacons of mr dimmesdales church and the young virgins who so idolized their minister and had made a shrine for him in their white bosoms which now by the by in their hurry and confusion they would scantly have given themselves time to cover with their kerchiefs all people in a word would come stumbling over their thresholds and turning up their amazed and horrorstricken visages around the scaffold whom would they discern there with the red eastern light upon his brow whom but the reverend arthur dimmesdale half frozen to death overwhelmed with shame and standing where hester prynne had stood ,The Scarlet Letter
carried away by the grotesque horror of this picture the minister unawares and to his own infinite alarm burst into a great peal of laughter it was immediately responded to by a light airy childish laugh in which with a thrill of the heartbut he knew not whether of exquisite pain or pleasure as acutehe recognized the tones of little pearl ,The Scarlet Letter
she silently ascended the steps and stood on the platform holding little pearl by the hand the minister felt for the childs other hand and took it the moment that he did so there came what seemed a tumultuous rush of new life other life than his own pouring like a torrent into his heart and hurrying through all his veins as if the mother and the child were communicating their vital warmth to his halftorpid system the three formed an electric chain ,The Scarlet Letter
nay not so my little pearl answered the minister for with the new energy of the moment all the dread of public exposure that had so long been the anguish of his life had returned upon him and he was already trembling at the conjunction in whichwith a strange joy neverthelesshe now found himself not so my child i shall indeed stand with thy mother and thee one other day but not tomorrow ,The Scarlet Letter
at the great judgment day whispered the ministerand strangely enough the sense that he was a professional teacher of the truth impelled him to answer the child so then and there before the judgmentseat thy mother and thou and i must stand together but the daylight of this world shall not see our meeting ,The Scarlet Letter
but before mr dimmesdale had done speaking a light gleamed far and wide over all the muffled sky it was doubtless caused by one of those meteors which the nightwatcher may so often observe burning out to waste in the vacant regions of the atmosphere so powerful was its radiance that it thoroughly illuminated the dense medium of cloud betwixt the sky and earth the great vault brightened like the dome of an immense lamp it showed the familiar scene of the street with the distinctness of midday but also with the awfulness that is always imparted to familiar objects by an unaccustomed light the wooden houses with their jutting stories and quaint gablepeaks the doorsteps and thresholds with the early grass springing up about them the gardenplots black with freshly turned earth the wheeltrack little worn and even in the marketplace margined with green on either sideall were visible but with a singularity of aspect that seemed to give another moral interpretation to the things of this world than they had ever borne before and there stood the minister with his hand over his heart and hester prynne with the embroidered letter glimmering on her bosom and little pearl herself a symbol and the connecting link between those two they stood in the noon of that strange and solemn splendor as if it were the light that is to reveal all secrets and the daybreak that shall unite all who belong to one another ,The Scarlet Letter
there was witchcraft in little pearls eyes and her face as she glanced upward at the minister wore that naughty smile which made its expression frequently so elvish she withdrew her hand from mr dimmesdales and pointed across the street but he clasped both his hands over his breast and cast his eyes towards the zenith ,The Scarlet Letter
nothing was more common in those days than to interpret all meteoric appearances and other natural phenomena that occurred with less regularity than the rise and set of sun and moon as so many revelations from a supernatural source thus a blazing spear a sword of flame a bow or a sheaf of arrows seen in the midnight sky prefigured indian warfare pestilence was known to have been foreboded by a shower of crimson light we doubt whether any marked event for good or evil ever befell new england from its settlement down to revolutionary times of which the inhabitants had not been previously warned by some spectacle of this nature not seldom it had been seen by multitudes oftener however its credibility rested on the faith of some lonely eyewitness who beheld the wonder through the colored magnifying and distorting medium of his imagination and shaped it more distinctly in his afterthought it was indeed a majestic idea that the destiny of nations should be revealed in these awful hieroglyphics on the cope of heaven a scroll so wide might not be deemed too expansive for providence to write a peoples doom upon the belief was a favorite one with our forefathers as betokening that their infant commonwealth was under a celestial guardianship of peculiar intimacy and strictness but what shall we say when an individual discovers a revelation addressed to himself alone on the same vast sheet of record in such a case it could only be the symptom of a highly disordered mental state when a man rendered morbidly selfcontemplative by long intense and secret pain had extended his egotism over the whole expanse of nature until the firmament itself should appear no more than a fitting page for his souls history and fate ,The Scarlet Letter
we impute it therefore solely to the disease in his own eye and heart that the minister looking upward to the zenith beheld there the appearance of an immense letterthe letter amarked out in lines of dull red light not but the meteor may have shown itself at that point burning duskily through a veil of cloud but with no such shape as his guilty imagination gave it or at least with so little definiteness that anothers guilt might have seen another symbol in it ,The Scarlet Letter
there was a singular circumstance that characterized mr dimmesdales psychological state at this moment all the time that he gazed upward to the zenith he was nevertheless perfectly aware that little pearl was pointing her finger towards old roger chillingworth who stood at no great distance from the scaffold the minister appeared to see him with the same glance that discerned the miraculous letter to his features as to all other objects the meteoric light imparted a new expression or it might well be that the physician was not careful then as at all other times to hide the malevolence with which he looked upon his victim certainly if the meteor kindled up the sky and disclosed the earth with an awfulness that admonished hester prynne and the clergyman of the day of judgment then might roger chillingworth have passed with them for the archfiend standing there with a smile and scowl to claim his own so vivid was the expression or so intense the ministers perception of it that it seemed still to remain painted on the darkness after the meteor had vanished with an effect as if the street and all things else were at once annihilated ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl mumbled something into his ear that sounded indeed like human language but was only such gibberish as children may be heard amusing themselves with by the hour together at all events if it involved any secret information in regard to old roger chillingworth it was in a tongue unknown to the erudite clergyman and did but increase the bewilderment of his mind the elvish child then laughed aloud ,The Scarlet Letter
worthy sir answered the physician who had now advanced to the foot of the platform pious master dimmesdale can this be you well well indeed we men of study whose heads are in our books have need to be straitly looked after we dream in our waking moments and walk in our sleep come good sir and my dear friend i pray you let me lead you home ,The Scarlet Letter
verily and in good faith answered roger chillingworth i knew nothing of the matter i had spent the better part of the night at the bedside of the worshipful governor winthrop doing what my poor skill might to give him ease he going home to a better world i likewise was on my way homeward when this strange light shone out come with me i beseech you reverend sir else you will be poorly able to do sabbath duty tomorrow aha see now how they trouble the brainthese booksthese books you should study less good sir and take a little pastime or these nightwhimseys will grow upon you ,The Scarlet Letter
the next day however being the sabbath he preached a discourse which was held to be the richest and most powerful and the most replete with heavenly influences that had ever proceeded from his lips souls it is said more souls than one were brought to the truth by the efficacy of that sermon and vowed within themselves to cherish a holy gratitude towards mr dimmesdale throughout the long hereafter but as he came down the pulpit steps the graybearded sexton met him holding up a black glove which the minister recognized as his own ,The Scarlet Letter
it was found said the sexton this morning on the scaffold where evildoers are set up to public shame satan dropped it there i take it intending a scurrilous jest against your reverence but indeed he was blind and foolish as he ever and always is a pure hand needs no glove to cover it ,The Scarlet Letter
thank you my good friend said the minister gravely but startled at heart for so confused was his remembrance that he had almost brought himself to look at the events of the past night as visionary yes it seems to be my glove indeed ,The Scarlet Letter
and since satan saw fit to steal it your reverence must needs handle him without gloves henceforward remarked the old sexton grimly smiling but did your reverence hear of the portent that was seen last nighta great red letter in the skythe letter a which we interpret to stand for angel for as our good governor winthrop was made an angel this past night it was doubtless held fit that there should be some notice thereof ,The Scarlet Letter
in her late singular interview with mr dimmesdale hester prynne was shocked at the condition to which she found the clergyman reduced his nerve seemed absolutely destroyed his moral force was abased into more than childish weakness it grovelled helpless on the ground even while his intellectual faculties retained their pristine strength or had perhaps acquired a morbid energy which disease only could have given them with her knowledge of a train of circumstances hidden from all others she could readily infer that besides the legitimate action of his own conscience a terrible machinery had been brought to bear and was still operating on mr dimmesdales wellbeing and repose knowing what this poor fallen man had once been her whole soul was moved by the shuddering terror with which he had appealed to herthe outcast womanfor support against his instinctively discovered enemy she decided moreover that he had a right to her utmost aid little accustomed in her long seclusion from society to measure her ideas of right and wrong by any standard external to herself hester sawor seemed to seethat there lay a responsibility upon her in reference to the clergyman which she owed to no other nor to the whole world besides the links that united her to the rest of human kindlinks of flowers or silk or gold or whatever the materialhad all been broken here was the iron link of mutual crime which neither he nor she could break like all other ties it brought along with it its obligations ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne did not now occupy precisely the same position in which we beheld her during the earlier periods of her ignominy years had come and gone pearl was now seven years old her mother with the scarlet letter on her breast glittering in its fantastic embroidery had long been a familiar object to the townspeople as is apt to be the case when a person stands out in any prominence before the community and at the same time interferes neither with public nor individual interests and convenience a species of general regard had ultimately grown up in reference to hester prynne it is to the credit of human nature that except where its selfishness is brought into play it loves more readily than it hates hatred by a gradual and quiet process will even be transformed to love unless the change be impeded by a continually new irritation of the original feeling of hostility in this matter of hester prynne there was neither irritation nor irksomeness she never battled with the public but submitted uncomplainingly to its worst usage she made no claim upon it in requital for what she suffered she did not weigh upon its sympathies then also the blameless purity of her life during all these years in which she had been set apart to infamy was reckoned largely in her favor with nothing now to lose in the sight of mankind and with no hope and seemingly no wish of gaining anything it could only be a genuine regard for virtue that had brought back the poor wanderer to its paths ,The Scarlet Letter
it was perceived too that while hester never put forward even the humblest title to share in the worlds privilegesfurther than to breathe the common air and earn daily bread for little pearl and herself by the faithful labor of her handsshe was quick to acknowledge her sisterhood with the race of man whenever benefits were to be conferred none so ready as she to give of her little substance to every demand of poverty even though the bitterhearted pauper threw back a gibe in requital of the food brought regularly to his door or the garments wrought for him by the fingers that could have embroidered a monarchs robe none so selfdevoted as hester when pestilence stalked through the town in all seasons of calamity indeed whether general or of individuals the outcast of society at once found her place she came not as a guest but as a rightful inmate into the household that was darkened by trouble as if its gloomy twilight were a medium in which she was entitled to hold intercourse with her fellowcreatures there glimmered the embroidered letter with comfort in its unearthly ray elsewhere the token of sin it was the taper of the sickchamber it had even thrown its gleam in the sufferers hard extremity across the verge of time it had shown him where to set his foot while the light of earth was fast becoming dim and ere the light of futurity could reach him in such emergencies hesters nature showed itself warm and rich a wellspring of human tenderness unfailing to every real demand and inexhaustible by the largest her breast with its badge of shame was but the softer pillow for the head that needed one she was selfordained a sister of mercy or we may rather say the worlds heavy hand had so ordained her when neither the world nor she looked forward to this result the letter was the symbol of her calling such helpfulness was found in herso much power to do and power to sympathizethat many people refused to interpret the scarlet a by its original signification they said that it meant able so strong was hester prynne with a womans strength ,The Scarlet Letter
it was only the darkened house that could contain her when sunshine came again she was not there her shadow had faded across the threshold the helpful inmate had departed without one backward glance to gather up the meed of gratitude if any were in the hearts of those whom she had served so zealously meeting them in the street she never raised her head to receive their greeting if they were resolute to accost her she laid her finger on the scarlet letter and passed on this might be pride but was so like humility that it produced all the softening influence of the latter quality on the public mind the public is despotic in its temper it is capable of denying common justice when too strenuously demanded as a right but quite as frequently it awards more than justice when the appeal is made as despots love to have it made entirely to its generosity interpreting hester prynnes deportment as an appeal of this nature society was inclined to show its former victim a more benign countenance than she cared to be favored with or perchance than she deserved ,The Scarlet Letter
the rulers and the wise and learned men of the community were longer in acknowledging the influence of hesters good qualities than the people the prejudices which they shared in common with the latter were fortified in themselves by an iron framework of reasoning that made it a far tougher labor to expel them day by day nevertheless their sour and rigid wrinkles were relaxing into something which in the due course of years might grow to be an expression of almost benevolence thus it was with the men of rank on whom their eminent position imposed the guardianship of the public morals individuals in private life meanwhile had quite forgiven hester prynne for her frailty nay more they had begun to look upon the scarlet letter as the token not of that one sin for which she had borne so long and dreary a penance but of her many good deeds since do you see that woman with the embroidered badge they would say to strangers it is our hesterthe towns own hester who is so kind to the poor so helpful to the sick so comfortable to the afflicted then it is true the propensity of human nature to tell the very worst of itself when embodied in the person of another would constrain them to whisper the black scandal of bygone years it was none the less a fact however that in the eyes of the very men who spoke thus the scarlet letter had the effect of the cross on a nuns bosom it imparted to the wearer a kind of sacredness which enabled her to walk securely amid all peril had she fallen among thieves it would have kept her safe it was reported and believed by many that an indian had drawn his arrow against the badge and that the missile struck it but fell harmless to the ground ,The Scarlet Letter
the effect of the symbolor rather of the position in respect to society that was indicated by iton the mind of hester prynne herself was powerful and peculiar all the light and graceful foliage of her character had been withered up by this redhot brand and had long ago fallen away leaving a bare and harsh outline which might have been repulsive had she possessed friends or companions to be repelled by it even the attractiveness of her person had undergone a similar change it might be partly owing to the studied austerity of her dress and partly to the lack of demonstration in her manners it was a sad transformation too that her rich and luxuriant hair had either been cut off or was so completely hidden by a cap that not a shining lock of it ever once gushed into the sunshine it was due in part to all these causes but still more to something else that there seemed to be no longer anything in hesters face for love to dwell upon nothing in hesters form though majestic and statuelike that passion would ever dream of clasping in its embrace nothing in hesters bosom to make it ever again the pillow of affection some attribute had departed from her the permanence of which had been essential to keep her a woman such is frequently the fate and such the stern development of the feminine character and person when the woman has encountered and lived through an experience of peculiar severity if she be all tenderness she will die if she survive the tenderness will either be crushed out of her orand the outward semblance is the samecrushed so deeply into her heart that it can never show itself more the latter is perhaps the truest theory she who has once been woman and ceased to be so might at any moment become a woman again if there were only the magic touch to effect the transfiguration we shall see whether hester prynne were ever afterwards so touched and so transfigured ,The Scarlet Letter
much of the marble coldness of hesters impression was to be attributed to the circumstance that her life had turned in a great measure from passion and feeling to thought standing alone in the worldalone as to any dependence on society and with little pearl to be guided and protectedalone and hopeless of retrieving her position even had she not scorned to consider it desirableshe cast away the fragments of a broken chain the worlds law was no law for her mind it was an age in which the human intellect newly emancipated had taken a more active and a wider range than for many centuries before men of the sword had overthrown nobles and kings men bolder than these had overthrown and rearrangednot actually but within the sphere of theory which was their most real abodethe whole system of ancient prejudice wherewith was linked much of ancient principle hester prynne imbibed this spirit she assumed a freedom of speculation then common enough on the other side of the atlantic but which our forefathers had they known it would have held to be a deadlier crime than that stigmatized by the scarlet letter in her lonesome cottage by the seashore thoughts visited her such as dared to enter no other dwelling in new england shadowy guests that would have been as perilous as demons to their entertainer could they have been seen so much as knocking at her door ,The Scarlet Letter
it is remarkable that persons who speculate the most boldly often conform with the most perfect quietude to the external regulations of society the thought suffices them without investing itself in the flesh and blood of action so it seemed to be with hester yet had little pearl never come to her from the spiritual world it might have been far otherwise then she might have come down to us in history hand in hand with ann hutchinson as the foundress of a religious sect she might in one of her phases have been a prophetess she might and not improbably would have suffered death from the stern tribunals of the period for attempting to undermine the foundations of the puritan establishment but in the education of her child the mothers enthusiasm of thought had something to wreak itself upon providence in the person of this little girl had assigned to hesters charge the germ and blossom of womanhood to be cherished and developed amid a host of difficulties everything was against her the world was hostile the childs own nature had something wrong in it which continually betokened that she had been born amissthe effluence of her mothers lawless passionand often impelled hester to ask in bitterness of heart whether it were for ill or good that the poor little creature had been born at all ,The Scarlet Letter
indeed the same dark question often rose into her mind with reference to the whole race of womanhood was existence worth accepting even to the happiest among them as concerned her own individual existence she had long ago decided in the negative and dismissed the point as settled a tendency to speculation though it may keep woman quiet as it does man yet makes her sad she discerns it may be such a hopeless task before her as a first step the whole system of society is to be torn down and built up anew then the very nature of the opposite sex or its long hereditary habit which has become like nature is to be essentially modified before woman can be allowed to assume what seems a fair and suitable position finally all other difficulties being obviated woman cannot take advantage of these preliminary reforms until she herself shall have undergone a still mightier change in which perhaps the ethereal essence wherein she has her truest life will be found to have evaporated a woman never overcomes these problems by any exercise of thought they are not to be solved or only in one way if her heart chance to come uppermost they vanish thus hester prynne whose heart had lost its regular and healthy throb wandered without a clew in the dark labyrinth of mind now turned aside by an insurmountable precipice now starting back from a deep chasm there was wild and ghastly scenery all around her and a home and comfort nowhere at times a fearful doubt strove to possess her soul whether it were not better to send pearl at once to heaven and go herself to such futurity as eternal justice should provide ,The Scarlet Letter
now however her interview with the reverend mr dimmesdale on the night of his vigil had given her a new theme of reflection and held up to her an object that appeared worthy of any exertion and sacrifice for its attainment she had witnessed the intense misery beneath which the minister struggled or to speak more accurately had ceased to struggle she saw that he stood on the verge of lunacy if he had not already stepped across it it was impossible to doubt that whatever painful efficacy there might be in the secret sting of remorse a deadlier venom had been infused into it by the hand that proffered relief a secret enemy had been continually by his side under the semblance of a friend and helper and had availed himself of the opportunities thus afforded for tampering with the delicate springs of mr dimmesdales nature hester could not but ask herself whether there had not originally been a defect of truth courage and loyalty on her own part in allowing the minister to be thrown into a position where so much evil was to be foreboded and nothing auspicious to be hoped her only justification lay in the fact that she had been able to discern no method of rescuing him from a blacker ruin than had overwhelmed herself except by acquiescing in roger chillingworths scheme of disguise under that impulse she had made her choice and had chosen as it now appeared the more wretched alternative of the two she determined to redeem her error so far as it might yet be possible strengthened by years of hard and solemn trial she felt herself no longer so inadequate to cope with roger chillingworth as on that night abased by sin and half maddened by the ignominy that was still new when they had talked together in the prisonchamber she had climbed her way since then to a higher point the old man on the other hand had brought himself nearer to her level or perhaps below it by the revenge which he had stooped for ,The Scarlet Letter
in fine hester prynne resolved to meet her former husband and do what might be in her power for the rescue of the victim on whom he had so evidently set his gripe the occasion was not long to seek one afternoon walking with pearl in a retired part of the peninsula she beheld the old physician with a basket on one arm and a staff in the other hand stooping along the ground in quest of roots and herbs to concoct his medicines withal ,The Scarlet Letter
hester bade little pearl run down to the margin of the water and play with the shells and tangled seaweed until she should have talked awhile with yonder gatherer of herbs so the child flew away like a bird and making bare her small white feet went pattering along the moist margin of the sea here and there she came to a full stop and peeped curiously into a pool left by the retiring tide as a mirror for pearl to see her face in forth peeped at her out of the pool with dark glistening curls around her head and an elfsmile in her eyes the image of a little maid whom pearl having no other playmate invited to take her hand and run a race with her but the visionary little maid on her part beckoned likewise as if to saythis is a better place come thou into the pool and pearl stepping in midleg deep beheld her own white feet at the bottom while out of a still lower depth came the gleam of a kind of fragmentary smile floating to and fro in the agitated water ,The Scarlet Letter
aha and is it mistress hester that has a word for old roger chillingworth answered he raising himself from his stooping posture with all my heart why mistress i hear good tidings of you on all hands no longer ago than yestereve a magistrate a wise and godly man was discoursing of your affairs mistress hester and whispered me that there had been question concerning you in the council it was debated whether or no with safety to the common weal yonder scarlet letter might be taken off your bosom on my life hester i made my entreaty to the worshipful magistrate that it might be done forthwith ,The Scarlet Letter
it lies not in the pleasure of the magistrates to take off this badge calmly replied hester were i worthy to be quit of it it would fall away of its own nature or be transformed into something that should speak a different purport ,The Scarlet Letter
nay then wear it if it suit you better rejoined he a woman must needs follow her own fancy touching the adornment of her person the letter is gayly embroidered and shows right bravely on your bosom ,The Scarlet Letter
all this while hester had been looking steadily at the old man and was shocked as well as wondersmitten to discern what a change had been wrought upon him within the past seven years it was not so much that he had grown older for though the traces of advancing life were visible he bore his age well and seemed to retain a wiry vigor and alertness but the former aspect of an intellectual and studious man calm and quiet which was what she best remembered in him had altogether vanished and been succeeded by an eager searching almost fierce yet carefully guarded look it seemed to be his wish and purpose to mask this expression with a smile but the latter played him false and flickered over his visage so derisively that the spectator could see his blackness all the better for it ever and anon too there came a glare of red light out of his eyes as if the old mans soul were on fire and kept on smouldering duskily within his breast until by some casual puff of passion it was blown into a momentary flame this he repressed as speedily as possible and strove to look as if nothing of the kind had happened ,The Scarlet Letter
in a word old roger chillingworth was a striking evidence of mans faculty of transforming himself into a devil if he will only for a reasonable space of time undertake a devils office this unhappy person had effected such a transformation by devoting himself for seven years to the constant analysis of a heart full of torture and deriving his enjoyment thence and adding fuel to those fiery tortures which he analyzed and gloated over ,The Scarlet Letter
and what of him cried roger chillingworth eagerly as if he loved the topic and were glad of an opportunity to discuss it with the only person of whom he could make a confidant not to hide the truth mistress hester my thoughts happen just now to be busy with the gentleman so speak freely and i will make answer ,The Scarlet Letter
when we last spake together said hester now seven years ago it was your pleasure to extort a promise of secrecy as touching the former relation betwixt yourself and me as the life and good fame of yonder man were in your hands there seemed no choice to me save to be silent in accordance with your behest yet it was not without heavy misgivings that i thus bound myself for having cast off all duty towards other human beings there remained a duty towards him and something whispered me that i was betraying it in pledging myself to keep your counsel since that day no man is so near to him as you you tread behind his every footstep you are beside him sleeping and waking you search his thoughts you burrow and rankle in his heart your clutch is on his life and you cause him to die daily a living death and still he knows you not in permitting this i have surely acted a false part by the only man to whom the power was left me to be true ,The Scarlet Letter
what evil have i done the man asked roger chillingworth again i tell thee hester prynne the richest fee that ever physician earned from monarch could not have bought such care as i have wasted on this miserable priest but for my aid his life would have burned away in torments within the first two years after the perpetration of his crime and thine for hester his spirit lacked the strength that could have borne up as thine has beneath a burden like thy scarlet letter o i could reveal a goodly secret but enough what art can do i have exhausted on him that he now breathes and creeps about on earth is owing all to me ,The Scarlet Letter
yea woman thou sayest truly cried old roger chillingworth letting the lurid fire of his heart blaze out before her eyes better had he died at once never did mortal suffer what this man has suffered and all all in the sight of his worst enemy he has been conscious of me he has felt an influence dwelling always upon him like a curse he knew by some spiritual sensefor the creator never made another being so sensitive as thishe knew that no friendly hand was pulling at his heartstrings and that an eye was looking curiously into him which sought only evil and found it but he knew not that the eye and hand were mine with the superstition common to his brotherhood he fancied himself given over to a fiend to be tortured with frightful dreams and desperate thoughts the sting of remorse and despair of pardon as a foretaste of what awaits him beyond the grave but it was the constant shadow of my presencethe closest propinquity of the man whom he had most vilely wrongedand who had grown to exist only by this perpetual poison of the direst revenge yea indeedhe did not errthere was a fiend at his elbow a mortal man with once a human heart has become a fiend for his especial torment ,The Scarlet Letter
the unfortunate physician while uttering these words lifted his hands with a look of horror as if he had beheld some frightful shape which he could not recognize usurping the place of his own image in a glass it was one of those momentswhich sometimes occur only at the interval of yearswhen a mans moral aspect is faithfully revealed to his minds eye not improbably he had never before viewed himself as he did now ,The Scarlet Letter
nonohe has but increased the debt answered the physician and as he proceeded his manner lost its fiercer characteristics and subsided into gloom dost thou remember me hester as i was nine years agone even then i was in the autumn of my days nor was it the early autumn but all my life had been made up of earnest studious thoughtful quiet years bestowed faithfully for the increase of mine own knowledge and faithfully too though this latter object was but casual to the otherfaithfully for the advancement of human welfare no life had been more peaceful and innocent than mine few lives so rich with benefits conferred dost thou remember me was i not though you might deem me cold nevertheless a man thoughtful for others craving little for himselfkind true just and of constant if not warm affections was i not all this ,The Scarlet Letter
i must reveal the secret answered hester firmly he must discern thee in thy true character what may be the result i know not but this long debt of confidence due from me to him whose bane and ruin i have been shall at length be paid so far as concerns the overthrow or preservation of his fair fame and his earthly state and perchance his life he is in thy hands nor do iwhom the scarlet letter has disciplined to truth though it be the truth of redhot iron entering into the soulnor do i perceive such advantage in his living any longer a life of ghastly emptiness that i shall stoop to implore thy mercy do with him as thou wilt there is no good for himno good for meno good for thee there is no good for little pearl there is no path to guide us out of this dismal maze ,The Scarlet Letter
woman i could wellnigh pity thee said roger chillingworth unable to restrain a thrill of admiration too for there was a quality almost majestic in the despair which she expressed thou hadst great elements peradventure hadst thou met earlier with a better love than mine this evil had not been i pity thee for the good that has been wasted in thy nature ,The Scarlet Letter
and i thee answered hester prynne for the hatred that has transformed a wise and just man to a fiend wilt thou yet purge it out of thee and be once more human if not for his sake then doubly for thine own forgive and leave his further retribution to the power that claims it i said but now that there could be no good event for him or thee or me who are here wandering together in this gloomy maze of evil and stumbling at every step over the guilt wherewith we have strewn our path it is not so there might be good for thee and thee alone since thou hast been deeply wronged and hast it at thy will to pardon wilt thou give up that only privilege wilt thou reject that priceless benefit ,The Scarlet Letter
peace hester peace replied the old man with gloomy sternness it is not granted me to pardon i have no such power as thou tellest me of my old faith long forgotten comes back to me and explains all that we do and all we suffer by thy first step awry thou didst plant the germ of evil but since that moment it has all been a dark necessity ye that have wronged me are not sinful save in a kind of typical illusion neither am i fiendlike who have snatched a fiends office from his hands it is our fate let the black flower blossom as it may now go thy ways and deal as thou wilt with yonder man ,The Scarlet Letter
so roger chillingwortha deformed old figure with a face that haunted mens memories longer than they likedtook leave of hester prynne and went stooping away along the earth he gathered here and there an herb or grubbed up a root and put it into the basket on his arm his gray beard almost touched the ground as he crept onward hester gazed after him a little while looking with a halffantastic curiosity to see whether the tender grass of early spring would not be blighted beneath him and show the wavering track of his footsteps sere and brown across its cheerful verdure she wondered what sort of herbs they were which the old man was so sedulous to gather would not the earth quickened to an evil purpose by the sympathy of his eye greet him with poisonous shrubs of species hitherto unknown that would start up under his fingers or might it suffice him that every wholesome growth should be converted into something deleterious and malignant at his touch did the sun which shone so brightly everywhere else really fall upon him or was there as it rather seemed a circle of ominous shadow moving along with his deformity whichever way he turned himself and whither was he now going would he not suddenly sink into the earth leaving a barren and blasted spot where in due course of time would be seen deadly nightshade dogwood henbane and whatever else of vegetable wickedness the climate could produce all flourishing with hideous luxuriance or would he spread bats wings and flee away looking so much the uglier the higher he rose towards heaven ,The Scarlet Letter
she upbraided herself for the sentiment but could not overcome or lessen it attempting to do so she thought of those longpast days in a distant land when he used to emerge at eventide from the seclusion of his study and sit down in the firelight of their home and in the light of her nuptial smile he needed to bask himself in that smile he said in order that the chill of so many lonely hours among his books might be taken off the scholars heart such scenes had once appeared not otherwise than happy but now as viewed through the dismal medium of her subsequent life they classed themselves among her ugliest remembrances she marvelled how such scenes could have been she marvelled how she could ever have been wrought upon to marry him she deemed it her crime most to be repented of that she had ever endured and reciprocated the lukewarm grasp of his hand and had suffered the smile of her lips and eyes to mingle and melt into his own and it seemed a fouler offence committed by roger chillingworth than any which had since been done him that in the time when her heart knew no better he had persuaded her to fancy herself happy by his side ,The Scarlet Letter
let men tremble to win the hand of woman unless they win along with it the utmost passion of her heart else it may be their miserable fortune as it was roger chillingworths when some mightier touch than their own may have awakened all her sensibilities to be reproached even for the calm content the marble image of happiness which they will have imposed upon her as the warm reality but hester ought long ago to have done with this injustice what did it betoken had seven long years under the torture of the scarlet letter inflicted so much of misery and wrought out no repentance ,The Scarlet Letter
the emotions of that brief space while she stood gazing after the crooked figure of old roger chillingworth threw a dark light on hesters state of mind revealing much that she might not otherwise have acknowledged to herself ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl whose activity of spirit never flagged had been at no loss for amusement while her mother talked with the old gatherer of herbs at first as already told she had flirted fancifully with her own image in a pool of water beckoning the phantom forth andas it declined to ventureseeking a passage for herself into its sphere of impalpable earth and unattainable sky soon finding however that either she or the image was unreal she turned elsewhere for better pastime she made little boats out of birchbark and freighted them with snailshells and sent out more ventures on the mighty deep than any merchant in new england but the larger part of them foundered near the shore she seized a live horseshoe by the tail and made prize of several fivefingers and laid out a jellyfish to melt in the warm sun then she took up the white foam that streaked the line of the advancing tide and threw it upon the breeze scampering after it with winged footsteps to catch the great snowflakes ere they fell perceiving a flock of beachbirds that fed and fluttered along the shore the naughty child picked up her apron full of pebbles and creeping from rock to rock after these small seafowl displayed remarkable dexterity in pelting them one little gray bird with a white breast pearl was almost sure had been hit by a pebble and fluttered away with a broken wing but then the elfchild sighed and gave up her sport because it grieved her to have done harm to a little being that was as wild as the seabreeze or as wild as pearl herself ,The Scarlet Letter
her final employment was to gather seaweed of various kinds and make herself a scarf or mantle and a headdress and thus assume the aspect of a little mermaid she inherited her mothers gift for devising drapery and costume as the last touch to her mermaids garb pearl took some eelgrass and imitated as best she could on her own bosom the decoration with which she was so familiar on her mothers a letterthe letter abut freshly green instead of scarlet the child bent her chin upon her breast and contemplated this device with strange interest even as if the one only thing for which she had been sent into the world was to make out its hidden import ,The Scarlet Letter
just then she heard her mothers voice and flitting along as lightly as one of the little seabirds appeared before hester prynne dancing laughing and pointing her finger to the ornament upon her bosom ,The Scarlet Letter
hester looked steadily into her little face but though there was that singular expression which she had so often remarked in her black eyes she could not satisfy herself whether pearl really attached any meaning to the symbol she felt a morbid desire to ascertain the point ,The Scarlet Letter
nay mother i have told all i know said pearl more seriously than she was wont to speak ask yonder old man whom thou hast been talking with it may be he can tell but in good earnest now mother dear what does this scarlet letter meanand why dost thou wear it on thy bosomand why does the minister keep his hand over his heart ,The Scarlet Letter
she took her mothers hand in both her own and gazed into her eyes with an earnestness that was seldom seen in her wild and capricious character the thought occurred to hester that the child might really be seeking to approach her with childlike confidence and doing what she could and as intelligently as she knew how to establish a meetingpoint of sympathy it showed pearl in an unwonted aspect heretofore the mother while loving her child with the intensity of a sole affection had schooled herself to hope for little other return than the waywardness of an april breeze which spends its time in airy sport and has its gusts of inexplicable passion and is petulant in its best of moods and chills oftener than caresses you when you take it to your bosom in requital of which misdemeanors it will sometimes of its own vague purpose kiss your cheek with a kind of doubtful tenderness and play gently with your hair and then be gone about its other idle business leaving a dreamy pleasure at your heart and this moreover was a mothers estimate of the childs disposition any other observer might have seen few but unamiable traits and have given them a far darker coloring but now the idea came strongly into hesters mind that pearl with her remarkable precocity and acuteness might already have approached the age when she could be made a friend and intrusted with as much of her mothers sorrows as could be imparted without irreverence either to the parent or the child in the little chaos of pearls character there might be seen emergingand could have been from the very firstthe steadfast principles of an unflinching couragean uncontrollable willa sturdy pride which might be disciplined into selfrespectand a bitter scorn of many things which when examined might be found to have the taint of falsehood in them she possessed affections too though hitherto acrid and disagreeable as are the richest flavors of unripe fruit with all these sterling attributes thought hester the evil which she inherited from her mother must be great indeed if a noble woman do not grow out of this elfish child ,The Scarlet Letter
pearls inevitable tendency to hover about the enigma of the scarlet letter seemed an innate quality of her being from the earliest epoch of her conscious life she had entered upon this as her appointed mission hester had often fancied that providence had a design of justice and retribution in endowing the child with this marked propensity but never until now had she bethought herself to ask whether linked with that design there might not likewise be a purpose of mercy and beneficence if little pearl were entertained with faith and trust as a spirit messenger no less than an earthly child might it not be her errand to soothe away the sorrow that lay cold in her mothers heart and converted it into a tomband to help her to overcome the passion once so wild and even yet neither dead nor asleep but only imprisoned within the same tomblike heart ,The Scarlet Letter
such were some of the thoughts that now stirred in hesters mind with as much vivacity of impression as if they had actually been whispered into her ear and there was little pearl all this while holding her mothers hand in both her own and turning her face upward while she put these searching questions once and again and still a third time ,The Scarlet Letter
silly pearl said she what questions are these there are many things in this world that a child must not ask about what know i of the ministers heart and as for the scarlet letter i wear it for the sake of its goldthread ,The Scarlet Letter
in all the seven bygone years hester prynne had never before been false to the symbol on her bosom it may be that it was the talisman of a stern and severe but yet a guardian spirit who now forsook her as recognizing that in spite of his strict watch over her heart some new evil had crept into it or some old one had never been expelled as for little pearl the earnestness soon passed out of her face ,The Scarlet Letter
but the child did not see fit to let the matter drop two or three times as her mother and she went homeward and as often at suppertime and while hester was putting her to bed and once after she seemed to be fairly asleep pearl looked up with mischief gleaming in her black eyes ,The Scarlet Letter
and the next morning the first indication the child gave of being awake was by popping up her head from the pillow and making that other inquiry which she had so unaccountably connected with her investigations about the scarlet letter ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne remained constant in her resolve to make known to mr dimmesdale at whatever risk of present pain or ulterior consequences the true character of the man who had crept into his intimacy for several days however she vainly sought an opportunity of addressing him in some of the meditative walks which she knew him to be in the habit of taking along the shores of the peninsula or on the wooded hills of the neighboring country there would have been no scandal indeed nor peril to the holy whiteness of the clergymans good fame had she visited him in his own study where many a penitent ere now had confessed sins of perhaps as deep a dye as the one betokened by the scarlet letter but partly that she dreaded the secret or undisguised interference of old roger chillingworth and partly that her conscious heart imputed suspicion where none could have been felt and partly that both the minister and she would need the whole wide world to breathe in while they talked togetherfor all these reasons hester never thought of meeting him in any narrower privacy than beneath the open sky ,The Scarlet Letter
at last while attending in a sickchamber whither the reverend mr dimmesdale had been summoned to make a prayer she learnt that he had gone the day before to visit the apostle eliot among his indian converts he would probably return by a certain hour in the afternoon of the morrow betimes therefore the next day hester took little pearlwho was necessarily the companion of all her mothers expeditions however inconvenient her presenceand set forth ,The Scarlet Letter
the road after the two wayfarers had crossed from the peninsula to the mainland was no other than a footpath it straggled onward into the mystery of the primeval forest this hemmed it in so narrowly and stood so black and dense on either side and disclosed such imperfect glimpses of the sky above that to hesters mind it imaged not amiss the moral wilderness in which she had so long been wandering the day was chill and sombre overhead was a gray expanse of cloud slightly stirred however by a breeze so that a gleam of flickering sunshine might now and then be seen at its solitary play along the path this flitting cheerfulness was always at the farther extremity of some long vista through the forest the sportive sunlightfeebly sportive at best in the predominant pensiveness of the day and scenewithdrew itself as they came nigh and left the spots where it had danced the drearier because they had hoped to find them bright ,The Scarlet Letter
mother said little pearl the sunshine does not love you it runs away and hides itself because it is afraid of something on your bosom now see there it is playing a good way off stand you here and let me run and catch it i am but a child it will not flee from me for i wear nothing on my bosom yet ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl set forth at a great pace and as hester smiled to perceive did actually catch the sunshine and stood laughing in the midst of it all brightened by its splendor and scintillating with the vivacity excited by rapid motion the light lingered about the lonely child as if glad of such a playmate until her mother had drawn almost nigh enough to step into the magic circle too ,The Scarlet Letter
as she attempted to do so the sunshine vanished or to judge from the bright expression that was dancing on pearls features her mother could have fancied that the child had absorbed it into herself and would give it forth again with a gleam about her path as they should plunge into some gloomier shade there was no other attribute that so much impressed her with a sense of new and untransmitted vigor in pearls nature as this neverfailing vivacity of spirits she had not the disease of sadness which almost all children in these latter days inherit with the scrofula from the troubles of their ancestors perhaps this too was a disease and but the reflex of the wild energy with which hester had fought against her sorrows before pearls birth it was certainly a doubtful charm imparting a hard metallic lustre to the childs character she wantedwhat some people want throughout lifea grief that should deeply touch her and thus humanize and make her capable of sympathy but there was time enough yet for little pearl ,The Scarlet Letter
o a story about the black man answered pearl taking hold of her mothers gown and looking up half earnestly half mischievously into her face how he haunts this forest and carries a book with hima big heavy book with iron clasps and how this ugly black man offers his book and an iron pen to everybody that meets him here among the trees and they are to write their names with their own blood and then he sets his mark on their bosoms didst thou ever meet the black man mother ,The Scarlet Letter
it was the old dame in the chimneycorner at the house where you watched last night said the child but she fancied me asleep while she was talking of it she said that a thousand and a thousand people had met him here and had written in his book and have his mark on them and that uglytempered lady old mistress hibbins was one and mother the old dame said that this scarlet letter was the black mans mark on thee and that it glows like a red flame when thou meetest him at midnight here in the dark wood is it true mother and dost thou go to meet him in the nighttime ,The Scarlet Letter
not that i remember said the child if thou fearest to leave me in our cottage thou mightest take me along with thee i would very gladly go but mother tell me now is there such a black man and didst thou ever meet him and is this his mark ,The Scarlet Letter
thus conversing they entered sufficiently deep into the wood to secure themselves from the observation of any casual passenger along the forest track here they sat down on a luxuriant heap of moss which at some epoch of the preceding century had been a gigantic pine with its roots and trunk in the darksome shade and its head aloft in the upper atmosphere it was a little dell where they had seated themselves with a leafstrewn bank rising gently on either side and a brook flowing through the midst over a bed of fallen and drowned leaves the trees impending over it had flung down great branches from time to time which choked up the current and compelled it to form eddies and black depths at some points while in its swifter and livelier passages there appeared a channelway of pebbles and brown sparkling sand letting the eyes follow along the course of the stream they could catch the reflected light from its water at some short distance within the forest but soon lost all traces of it amid the bewilderment of treetrunks and underbrush and here and there a huge rock covered over with gray lichens all these giant trees and bowlders of granite seemed intent on making a mystery of the course of this small brook fearing perhaps that with its neverceasing loquacity it should whisper tales out of the heart of the old forest whence it flowed or mirror its revelations on the smooth surface of a pool continually indeed as it stole onward the streamlet kept up a babble kind quiet soothing but melancholy like the voice of a young child that was spending its infancy without playfulness and knew not how to be merry among sad acquaintance and events of sombre hue ,The Scarlet Letter
but the brook in the course of its little lifetime among the foresttrees had gone through so solemn an experience that it could not help talking about it and seemed to have nothing else to say pearl resembled the brook inasmuch as the current of her life gushed from a wellspring as mysterious and had flowed through scenes shadowed as heavily with gloom but unlike the little stream she danced and sparkled and prattled airily along her course ,The Scarlet Letter
if thou hadst a sorrow of thine own the brook might tell thee of it answered her mother even as it is telling me of mine but now pearl i hear a footstep along the path and the noise of one putting aside the branches i would have thee betake thyself to play and leave me to speak with him that comes yonder ,The Scarlet Letter
and so it is said the child and mother he has his hand over his heart is it because when the minister wrote his name in the book the black man set his mark in that place but why does he not wear it outside his bosom as thou dost mother ,The Scarlet Letter
the child went singing away following up the current of the brook and striving to mingle a more lightsome cadence with its melancholy voice but the little stream would not be comforted and still kept telling its unintelligible secret of some very mournful mystery that had happenedor making a prophetic lamentation about something that was yet to happenwithin the verge of the dismal forest so pearl who had enough of shadow in her own little life chose to break off all acquaintance with this repining brook she set herself therefore to gathering violets and woodanemones and some scarlet columbines that she found growing in the crevices of a high rock ,The Scarlet Letter
when her elfchild had departed hester prynne made a step or two towards the track that led through the forest but still remained under the deep shadow of the trees she beheld the minister advancing along the path entirely alone and leaning on a staff which he had cut by the wayside he looked haggard and feeble and betrayed a nerveless despondency in his air which had never so remarkably characterized him in his walks about the settlement nor in any other situation where he deemed himself liable to notice here it was wofully visible in this intense seclusion of the forest which of itself would have been a heavy trial to the spirits there was a listlessness in his gait as if he saw no reason for taking one step farther nor felt any desire to do so but would have been glad could he be glad of anything to fling himself down at the root of the nearest tree and lie there passive forevermore the leaves might bestrew him and the soil gradually accumulate and form a little hillock over his frame no matter whether there were life in it or no death was too definite an object to be wished for or avoided ,The Scarlet Letter
gathering himself quickly up he stood more erect like a man taken by surprise in a mood to which he was reluctant to have witnesses throwing his eyes anxiously in the direction of the voice he indistinctly beheld a form under the trees clad in garments so sombre and so little relieved from the gray twilight into which the clouded sky and the heavy foliage had darkened the noontide that he knew not whether it were a woman or a shadow it may be that his pathway through life was haunted thus by a spectre that had stolen out from among his thoughts ,The Scarlet Letter
it was no wonder that they thus questioned one anothers actual and bodily existence and even doubted of their own so strangely did they meet in the dim wood that it was like the first encounter in the world beyond the grave of two spirits who had been intimately connected in their former life but now stood coldly shuddering in mutual dread as not yet familiar with their state nor wonted to the companionship of disembodied beings each a ghost and awestricken at the other ghost they were awestricken likewise at themselves because the crisis flung back to them their consciousness and revealed to each heart its history and experience as life never does except at such breathless epochs the soul beheld its features in the mirror of the passing moment it was with fear and tremulously and as it were by a slow reluctant necessity that arthur dimmesdale put forth his hand chill as death and touched the chill hand of hester prynne the grasp cold as it was took away what was dreariest in the interview they now felt themselves at least inhabitants of the same sphere ,The Scarlet Letter
without a word more spokenneither he nor she assuming the guidance but with an unexpressed consentthey glided back into the shadow of the woods whence hester had emerged and sat down on the heap of moss where she and pearl had before been sitting when they found voice to speak it was at first only to utter remarks and inquiries such as any two acquaintance might have made about the gloomy sky the threatening storm and next the health of each thus they went onward not boldly but step by step into the themes that were brooding deepest in their hearts so long estranged by fate and circumstances they needed something slight and casual to run before and throw open the doors of intercourse so that their real thoughts might be led across the threshold ,The Scarlet Letter
nonenothing but despair he answered what else could i look for being what i am and leading such a life as mine were i an atheista man devoid of consciencea wretch with coarse and brutal instinctsi might have found peace long ere now nay i never should have lost it but as matters stand with my soul whatever of good capacity there originally was in me all of gods gifts that were the choicest have become the ministers of spiritual torment hester i am most miserable ,The Scarlet Letter
more misery hesteronly the more misery answered the clergyman with a bitter smile as concerns the good which i may appear to do i have no faith in it it must needs be a delusion what can a ruined soul like mine effect towards the redemption of other soulsor a polluted soul towards their purification and as for the peoples reverence would that it were turned to scorn and hatred canst thou deem it hester a consolation that i must stand up in my pulpit and meet so many eyes turned upward to my face as if the light of heaven were beaming from itmust see my flock hungry for the truth and listening to my words as if a tongue of pentecost were speakingand then look inward and discern the black reality of what they idolize i have laughed in bitterness and agony of heart at the contrast between what i seem and what i am and satan laughs at it ,The Scarlet Letter
you wrong yourself in this said hester gently you have deeply and sorely repented your sin is left behind you in the days long past your present life is not less holy in very truth than it seems in peoples eyes is there no reality in the penitence thus sealed and witnessed by good works and wherefore should it not bring you peace ,The Scarlet Letter
no hester no replied the clergyman there is no substance in it it is cold and dead and can do nothing for me of penance i have had enough of penitence there has been none else i should long ago have thrown off these garments of mock holiness and have shown myself to mankind as they will see me at the judgmentseat happy are you hester that wear the scarlet letter openly upon your bosom mine burns in secret thou little knowest what a relief it is after the torment of a seven years cheat to look into an eye that recognizes me for what i am had i one friendor were it my worst enemyto whom when sickened with the praises of all other men i could daily betake myself and be known as the vilest of all sinners methinks my soul might keep itself alive thereby even thus much of truth would save me but now it is all falsehoodall emptinessall death ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne looked into his face but hesitated to speak yet uttering his longrestrained emotions so vehemently as he did his words here offered her the very point of circumstances in which to interpose what she came to say she conquered her fears and spoke ,The Scarlet Letter
such a friend as thou hast even now wished for said she with whom to weep over thy sin thou hast in me the partner of itagain she hesitated but brought out the words with an effortthou hast long had such an enemy and dwellest with him under the same roof ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne was now fully sensible of the deep injury for which she was responsible to this unhappy man in permitting him to lie for so many years or indeed for a single moment at the mercy of one whose purposes could not be other than malevolent the very contiguity of his enemy beneath whatever mask the latter might conceal himself was enough to disturb the magnetic sphere of a being so sensitive as arthur dimmesdale there had been a period when hester was less alive to this consideration or perhaps in the misanthropy of her own trouble she left the minister to bear what she might picture to herself as a more tolerable doom but of late since the night of his vigil all her sympathies towards him had been both softened and invigorated she now read his heart more accurately she doubted not that the continual presence of roger chillingworththe secret poison of his malignity infecting all the air about himand his authorized interference as a physician with the ministers physical and spiritual infirmitiesthat these bad opportunities had been turned to a cruel purpose by means of them the sufferers conscience had been kept in an irritated state the tendency of which was not to cure by wholesome pain but to disorganize and corrupt his spiritual being its result on earth could hardly fail to be insanity and hereafter that eternal alienation from the good and true of which madness is perhaps the earthly type ,The Scarlet Letter
such was the ruin to which she had brought the man oncenay why should we not speak itstill so passionately loved hester felt that the sacrifice of the clergymans good name and death itself as she had already told roger chillingworth would have been infinitely preferable to the alternative which she had taken upon herself to choose and now rather than have had this grievous wrong to confess she would gladly have lain down on the forestleaves and died there at arthur dimmesdales feet ,The Scarlet Letter
o arthur cried she forgive me in all things else i have striven to be true truth was the one virtue which i might have held fast and did hold fast through all extremity save when thy goodthy lifethy famewere put in question then i consented to a deception but a lie is never good even though death threaten on the other side dost thou not see what i would say that old manthe physicianhe whom they call roger chillingworthhe was my husband ,The Scarlet Letter
the minister looked at her for an instant with all that violence of passion whichintermixed in more shapes than one with his higher purer softer qualitieswas in fact the portion of him which the devil claimed and through which he sought to win the rest never was there a blacker or a fiercer frown than hester now encountered for the brief space that it lasted it was a dark transfiguration but his character had been so much enfeebled by suffering that even its lower energies were incapable of more than a temporary struggle he sank down on the ground and buried his face in his hands ,The Scarlet Letter
i might have known it murmured he i did know it was not the secret told me in the natural recoil of my heart at the first sight of him and as often as i have seen him since why did i not understand o hester prynne thou little little knowest all the horror of this thing and the shamethe indelicacythe horrible ugliness of this exposure of a sick and guilty heart to the very eye that would gloat over it woman woman thou art accountable for this i cannot forgive thee ,The Scarlet Letter
with sudden and desperate tenderness she threw her arms around him and pressed his head against her bosom little caring though his cheek rested on the scarlet letter he would have released himself but strove in vain to do so hester would not set him free lest he should look her sternly in the face all the world had frowned on herfor seven long years had it frowned upon this lonely womanand still she bore it all nor ever once turned away her firm sad eyes heaven likewise had frowned upon her and she had not died but the frown of this pale weak sinful and sorrowstricken man was what hester could not bear and live ,The Scarlet Letter
i do forgive you hester replied the minister at length with a deep utterance out of an abyss of sadness but no anger i freely forgive you now may god forgive us both we are not hester the worst sinners in the world there is one worse than even the polluted priest that old mans revenge has been blacker than my sin he has violated in cold blood the sanctity of a human heart thou and i hester never did so ,The Scarlet Letter
they sat down again side by side and hand clasped in hand on the mossy trunk of the fallen tree life had never brought them a gloomier hour it was the point whither their pathway had so long been tending and darkening ever as it stole alongand yet it enclosed a charm that made them linger upon it and claim another and another and after all another moment the forest was obscure around them and creaked with a blast that was passing through it the boughs were tossing heavily above their heads while one solemn old tree groaned dolefully to another as if telling the sad story of the pair that sat beneath or constrained to forebode evil to come ,The Scarlet Letter
and yet they lingered how dreary looked the foresttrack that led backward to the settlement where hester prynne must take up again the burden of her ignominy and the minister the hollow mockery of his good name so they lingered an instant longer no golden light had ever been so precious as the gloom of this dark forest here seen only by his eyes the scarlet letter need not burn into the bosom of the fallen woman here seen only by her eyes arthur dimmesdale false to god and man might be for one moment true ,The Scarlet Letter
there is a strange secrecy in his nature replied hester thoughtfully and it has grown upon him by the hidden practices of his revenge i deem it not likely that he will betray the secret he will doubtless seek other means of satiating his dark passion ,The Scarlet Letter
and ihow am i to live longer breathing the same air with this deadly enemy exclaimed arthur dimmesdale shrinking within himself and pressing his hand nervously against his hearta gesture that had grown involuntary with him ,The Scarlet Letter
it were far worse than death replied the minister but how to avoid it what choice remains to me shall i lie down again on these withered leaves where i cast myself when thou didst tell me what he was must i sink down there and die at once ,The Scarlet Letter
is the world then so narrow exclaimed hester prynne fixing her deep eyes on the ministers and instinctively exercising a magnetic power over a spirit so shattered and subdued that it could hardly hold itself erect doth the universe lie within the compass of yonder town which only a little time ago was but a leafstrewn desert as lonely as this around us whither leads yonder foresttrack backward to the settlement thou sayest yes but onward too deeper it goes and deeper into the wilderness less plainly to be seen at every step until some few miles hence the yellow leaves will show no vestige of the white mans tread there thou art free so brief a journey would bring thee from a world where thou hast been most wretched to one where thou mayest still be happy is there not shade enough in all this boundless forest to hide thy heart from the gaze of roger chillingworth ,The Scarlet Letter
then there is the broad pathway of the sea continued hester it brought thee hither if thou so choose it will bear thee back again in our native land whether in some remote rural village or in vast londonor surely in germany in france in pleasant italythou wouldst be beyond his power and knowledge and what hast thou to do with all these iron men and their opinions they have kept thy better part in bondage too long already ,The Scarlet Letter
it cannot be answered the minister listening as if he were called upon to realize a dream i am powerless to go wretched and sinful as i am i have had no other thought than to drag on my earthly existence in the sphere where providence hath placed me lost as my own soul is i would still do what i may for other human souls i dare not quit my post though an unfaithful sentinel whose sure reward is death and dishonor when his dreary watch shall come to an end ,The Scarlet Letter
thou art crushed under this seven years weight of misery replied hester fervently resolved to buoy him up with her own energy but thou shalt leave it all behind thee it shall not cumber thy steps as thou treadest along the forestpath neither shalt thou freight the ship with it if thou prefer to cross the sea leave this wreck and ruin here where it hath happened meddle no more with it begin all anew hast thou exhausted possibility in the failure of this one trial not so the future is yet full of trial and success there is happiness to be enjoyed there is good to be done exchange this false life of thine for a true one be if thy spirit summon thee to such a mission the teacher and apostle of the red men oras is more thy naturebe a scholar and a sage among the wisest and the most renowned of the cultivated world preach write act do anything save to lie down and die give up this name of arthur dimmesdale and make thyself another and a high one such as thou canst wear without fear or shame why shouldst thou tarry so much as one other day in the torments that have so gnawed into thy lifethat have made thee feeble to will and to dothat will leave thee powerless even to repent up and away ,The Scarlet Letter
o hester cried arthur dimmesdale in whose eyes a fitful light kindled by her enthusiasm flashed up and died away thou tellest of running a race to a man whose knees are tottering beneath him i must die here there is not the strength or courage left me to venture into the wide strange difficult world alone ,The Scarlet Letter
arthur dimmesdale gazed into hesters face with a look in which hope and joy shone out indeed but with fear betwixt them and a kind of horror at her boldness who had spoken what he vaguely hinted at but dared not speak ,The Scarlet Letter
but hester prynne with a mind of native courage and activity and for so long a period not merely estranged but outlawed from society had habituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether foreign to the clergyman she had wandered without rule or guidance in a moral wilderness as vast as intricate and shadowy as the untamed forest amid the gloom of which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide their fate her intellect and heart had their home as it were in desert places where she roamed as freely as the wild indian in his woods for years past she had looked from this estranged point of view at human institutions and whatever priests or legislators had established criticising all with hardly more reverence than the indian would feel for the clerical band the judicial robe the pillory the gallows the fireside or the church the tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free the scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread shame despair solitude these had been her teachersstern and wild onesand they had made her strong but taught her much amiss ,The Scarlet Letter
the minister on the other hand had never gone through an experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws although in a single instance he had so fearfully transgressed one of the most sacred of them but this had been a sin of passion not of principle nor even purpose since that wretched epoch he had watched with morbid zeal and minuteness not his actsfor those it was easy to arrangebut each breath of emotion and his every thought at the head of the social system as the clergymen of that day stood he was only the more trammelled by its regulations its principles and even its prejudices as a priest the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in as a man who had once sinned but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all ,The Scarlet Letter
thus we seem to see that as regarded hester prynne the whole seven years of outlaw and ignominy had been little other than a preparation for this very hour but arthur dimmesdale were such a man once more to fall what plea could be urged in extenuation of his crime none unless it avail him somewhat that he was broken down by long and exquisite suffering that his mind was darkened and confused by the very remorse which harrowed it that between fleeing as an avowed criminal and remaining as a hypocrite conscience might find it hard to strike the balance that it was human to avoid the peril of death and infamy and the inscrutable machinations of an enemy that finally to this poor pilgrim on his dreary and desert path faint sick miserable there appeared a glimpse of human affection and sympathy a new life and a true one in exchange for the heavy doom which he was now expiating and be the stern and sad truth spoken that the breach which guilt has once made into the human soul is never in this mortal state repaired it may be watched and guarded so that the enemy shall not force his way again into the citadel and might even in his subsequent assaults select some other avenue in preference to that where he had formerly succeeded but there is still the ruined wall and near it the stealthy tread of the foe that would win over again his unforgotten triumph ,The Scarlet Letter
if in all these past seven years thought he i could recall one instant of peace or hope i would yet endure for the sake of that earnest of heavens mercy but nowsince i am irrevocably doomedwherefore should i not snatch the solace allowed to the condemned culprit before his execution or if this be the path to a better life as hester would persuade me i surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it neither can i any longer live without her companionship so powerful is she to sustainso tender to soothe o thou to whom i dare not lift mine eyes wilt thou yet pardon me ,The Scarlet Letter
the decision once made a glow of strange enjoyment threw its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast it was the exhilarating effectupon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of his own heartof breathing the wild free atmosphere of an unredeemed unchristianized lawless region his spirit rose as it were with a bound and attained a nearer prospect of the sky than throughout all the misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth of a deeply religious temperament there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in his mood ,The Scarlet Letter
do i feel joy again cried he wondering at himself methought the germ of it was dead in me o hester thou art my better angel i seem to have flung myselfsick sinstained and sorrowblackeneddown upon these forestleaves and to have risen up all made anew and with new powers to glorify him that hath been merciful this is already the better life why did we not find it sooner ,The Scarlet Letter
so speaking she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter and taking it from her bosom threw it to a distance among the withered leaves the mystic token alighted on the hither verge of the stream with a hands breadth farther flight it would have fallen into the water and have given the little brook another woe to carry onward besides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring about but there lay the embroidered letter glittering like a lost jewel which some illfated wanderer might pick up and thenceforth be haunted by strange phantoms of guilt sinkings of the heart and unaccountable misfortune ,The Scarlet Letter
the stigma gone hester heaved a long deep sigh in which the burden of shame and anguish departed from her spirit o exquisite relief she had not known the weight until she felt the freedom by another impulse she took off the formal cap that confined her hair and down it fell upon her shoulders dark and rich with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance and imparting the charm of softness to her features there played around her mouth and beamed out of her eyes a radiant and tender smile that seemed gushing from the very heart of womanhood a crimson flush was glowing on her cheek that had been long so pale her sex her youth and the whole richness of her beauty came back from what men call the irrevocable past and clustered themselves with her maiden hope and a happiness before unknown within the magic circle of this hour and as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts it vanished with their sorrow all at once as with a sudden smile of heaven forth burst the sunshine pouring a very flood into the obscure forest gladdening each green leaf transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold and gleaming adown the gray trunks of the solemn trees the objects that had made a shadow hitherto embodied the brightness now the course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the woods heart of mystery which had become a mystery of joy ,The Scarlet Letter
such was the sympathy of naturethat wild heathen nature of the forest never subjugated by human law nor illumined by higher truthwith the bliss of these two spirits love whether newly born or aroused from a deathlike slumber must always create a sunshine filling the heart so full of radiance that it overflows upon the outward world had the forest still kept its gloom it would have been bright in hesters eyes and bright in arthur dimmesdales ,The Scarlet Letter
thou must know pearl said she our little pearl thou hast seen heryes i know itbut thou wilt see her now with other eyes she is a strange child i hardly comprehend her but thou wilt love her dearly as i do and wilt advise me how to deal with her ,The Scarlet Letter
dost thou think the child will be glad to know me asked the minister somewhat uneasily i have long shrunk from children because they often show a distrusta backwardness to be familiar with me i have even been afraid of little pearl ,The Scarlet Letter
hester smiled and again called to pearl who was visible at some distance as the minister had described her like a brightapparelled vision in a sunbeam which fell down upon her through an arch of boughs the ray quivered to and fro making her figure dim or distinctnow like a real child now like a childs spiritas the splendor went and came again she heard her mothers voice and approached slowly through the forest ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl had not found the hour pass wearisomely while her mother sat talking with the clergyman the great black foreststern as it showed itself to those who brought the guilt and troubles of the world into its bosombecame the playmate of the lonely infant as well as it knew how sombre as it was it put on the kindest of its moods to welcome her it offered her the partridgeberries the growth of the preceding autumn but ripening only in the spring and now red as drops of blood upon the withered leaves these pearl gathered and was pleased with their wild flavor the small denizens of the wilderness hardly took pains to move out of her path a partridge indeed with a brood of ten behind her ran forward threateningly but soon repented of her fierceness and clucked to her young ones not to be afraid a pigeon alone on a low branch allowed pearl to come beneath and uttered a sound as much of greeting as alarm a squirrel from the lofty depths of his domestic tree chattered either in anger or merrimentfor a squirrel is such a choleric and humorous little personage that it is hard to distinguish between his moodsso he chattered at the child and flung down a nut upon her head it was a last years nut and already gnawed by his sharp tooth a fox startled from his sleep by her light footstep on the leaves looked inquisitively at pearl as doubting whether it were better to steal off or renew his nap on the same spot a wolf it is saidbut here the tale has surely lapsed into the improbablecame up and smelt of pearls robe and offered his savage head to be patted by her hand the truth seems to be however that the motherforest and these wild things which it nourished all recognized a kindred wildness in the human child ,The Scarlet Letter
and she was gentler here than in the grassymargined streets of the settlement or in her mothers cottage the flowers appeared to know it and one and another whispered as she passed adorn thyself with me thou beautiful child adorn thyself with meand to please them pearl gathered the violets and anemones and columbines and some twigs of the freshest green which the old trees held down before her eyes with these she decorated her hair and her young waist and became a nymphchild or an infant dryad or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood in such guise had pearl adorned herself when she heard her mothers voice and came slowly back ,The Scarlet Letter
thou wilt love her dearly repeated hester prynne as she and the minister sat watching little pearl dost thou not think her beautiful and see with what natural skill she has made those simple flowers adorn her had she gathered pearls and diamonds and rubies in the wood they could not have become her better she is a splendid child but i know whose brow she has ,The Scarlet Letter
dost thou know hester said arthur dimmesdale with an unquiet smile that this dear child tripping about always at thy side hath caused me many an alarm methoughto hester what a thought is that and how terrible to dread itthat my own features were partly repeated in her face and so strikingly that the world might see them but she is mostly thine ,The Scarlet Letter
no no not mostly answered the mother with a tender smile a little longer and thou needest not to be afraid to trace whose child she is but how strangely beautiful she looks with those wildflowers in her hair it is as if one of the fairies whom we left in our dear old england had decked her out to meet us ,The Scarlet Letter
it was with a feeling which neither of them had ever before experienced that they sat and watched pearls slow advance in her was visible the tie that united them she had been offered to the world these seven years past as the living hieroglyphic in which was revealed the secret they so darkly sought to hideall written in this symbolall plainly manifesthad there been a prophet or magician skilled to read the character of flame and pearl was the oneness of their being be the foregone evil what it might how could they doubt that their earthly lives and future destinies were conjoined when they beheld at once the material union and the spiritual idea in whom they met and were to dwell immortally together thoughts like theseand perhaps other thoughts which they did not acknowledge or definethrew an awe about the child as she came onward ,The Scarlet Letter
let her see nothing strangeno passion nor eagernessin thy way of accosting her whispered hester our pearl is a fitful and fantastic little elf sometimes especially she is seldom tolerant of emotion when she does not fully comprehend the why and wherefore but the child hath strong affections she loves me and will love thee ,The Scarlet Letter
thou canst not think said the minister glancing aside at hester prynne how my heart dreads this interview and yearns for it but in truth as i already told thee children are not readily won to be familiar with me they will not climb my knee nor prattle in my ear nor answer to my smile but stand apart and eye me strangely even little babes when i take them in my arms weep bitterly yet pearl twice in her little lifetime hath been kind to me the first timethou knowest it well the last was when thou ledst her with thee to the house of yonder stern old governor ,The Scarlet Letter
by this time pearl had reached the margin of the brook and stood on the farther side gazing silently at hester and the clergyman who still sat together on the mossy treetrunk waiting to receive her just where she had paused the brook chanced to form a pool so smooth and quiet that it reflected a perfect image of her little figure with all the brilliant picturesqueness of her beauty in its adornment of flowers and wreathed foliage but more refined and spiritualized than the reality this image so nearly identical with the living pearl seemed to communicate somewhat of its own shadowy and intangible quality to the child herself it was strange the way in which pearl stood looking so steadfastly at them through the dim medium of the forestgloom herself meanwhile all glorified with a ray of sunshine that was attracted thitherward as by a certain sympathy in the brook beneath stood another childanother and the samewith likewise its ray of golden light hester felt herself in some indistinct and tantalizing manner estranged from pearl as if the child in her lonely ramble through the forest had strayed out of the sphere in which she and her mother dwelt together and was now vainly seeking to return to it ,The Scarlet Letter
there was both truth and error in the impression the child and mother were estranged but through hesters fault not pearls since the latter rambled from her side another inmate had been admitted within the circle of the mothers feelings and so modified the aspect of them all that pearl the returning wanderer could not find her wonted place and hardly knew where she was ,The Scarlet Letter
i have a strange fancy observed the sensitive minister that this brook is the boundary between two worlds and that thou canst never meet thy pearl again or is she an elfish spirit who as the legends of our childhood taught us is forbidden to cross a running stream pray hasten her for this delay has already imparted a tremor to my nerves ,The Scarlet Letter
come dearest child said hester encouragingly and stretching out both her arms how slow thou art when hast thou been so sluggish before now here is a friend of mine who must be thy friend also thou wilt have twice as much love henceforward as thy mother alone could give thee leap across the brook and come to us thou canst leap like a young deer ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl without responding in any manner to these honeysweet expressions remained on the other side of the brook now she fixed her bright wild eyes on her mother now on the minister and now included them both in the same glance as if to detect and explain to herself the relation which they bore to one another for some unaccountable reason as arthur dimmesdale felt the childs eyes upon himself his handwith that gesture so habitual as to have become involuntarystole over his heart at length assuming a singular air of authority pearl stretched out her hand with the small forefinger extended and pointing evidently towards her mothers breast and beneath in the mirror of the brook there was the flowergirdled and sunny image of little pearl pointing her small forefinger too ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl still pointed with her forefinger and a frown gathered on her brow the more impressive from the childish the almost babylike aspect of the features that conveyed it as her mother still kept beckoning to her and arraying her face in a holiday suit of unaccustomed smiles the child stamped her foot with a yet more imperious look and gesture in the brook again was the fantastic beauty of the image with its reflected frown its pointed finger and imperious gesture giving emphasis to the aspect of little pearl ,The Scarlet Letter
hasten pearl or i shall be angry with thee cried hester prynne who however inured to such behavior on the elfchilds part at other seasons was naturally anxious for a more seemly deportment now leap across the brook naughty child and run hither else i must come to thee ,The Scarlet Letter
but pearl not a whit startled at her mothers threats any more than mollified by her entreaties now suddenly burst into a fit of passion gesticulating violently and throwing her small figure into the most extravagant contortions she accompanied this wild outbreak with piercing shrieks which the woods reverberated on all sides so that alone as she was in her childish and unreasonable wrath it seemed as if a hidden multitude were lending her their sympathy and encouragement seen in the brook once more was the shadowy wrath of pearls image crowned and girdled with flowers but stamping its foot wildly gesticulating and in the midst of all still pointing its small forefinger at hesters bosom ,The Scarlet Letter
i see what ails the child whispered hester to the clergyman and turning pale in spite of a strong effort to conceal her trouble and annoyance children will not abide any the slightest change in the accustomed aspect of things that are daily before their eyes pearl misses something which she has always seen me wear ,The Scarlet Letter
i pray you answered the minister if thou hast any means of pacifying the child do it forthwith save it were the cankered wrath of an old witch like mistress hibbins added he attempting to smile i know nothing that i would not sooner encounter than this passion in a child in pearls young beauty as in the wrinkled witch it has a preternatural effect pacify her if thou lovest me ,The Scarlet Letter
hester turned again towards pearl with a crimson blush upon her cheek a conscious glance aside at the clergyman and then a heavy sigh while even before she had time to speak the blush yielded to a deadly pallor ,The Scarlet Letter
was ever such a child observed hester aside to the minister o i have much to tell thee about her but in very truth she is right as regards this hateful token i must bear its torture yet a little longeronly a few days longeruntil we shall have left this region and look back hither as to a land which we have dreamed of the forest cannot hide it the midocean shall take it from my hand and swallow it up forever ,The Scarlet Letter
with these words she advanced to the margin of the brook took up the scarlet letter and fastened it again into her bosom hopefully but a moment ago as hester had spoken of drowning it in the deep sea there was a sense of inevitable doom upon her as she thus received back this deadly symbol from the hand of fate she had flung it into infinite spaceshe had drawn an hours free breathand here again was the scarlet misery glittering on the old spot so it ever is whether thus typified or no that an evil deed invests itself with the character of doom hester next gathered up the heavy tresses of her hair and confined them beneath her cap as if there were a withering spell in the sad letter her beauty the warmth and richness of her womanhood departed like fading sunshine and a gray shadow seemed to fall across her ,The Scarlet Letter
in a mood of tenderness that was not usual with her she drew down her mothers head and kissed her brow and both her cheeks but thenby a kind of necessity that always impelled this child to alloy whatever comfort she might chance to give with a throb of anguishpearl put up her mouth and kissed the scarlet letter too ,The Scarlet Letter
not now dear child answered hester but in days to come he will walk hand in hand with us we will have a home and fireside of our own and thou shalt sit upon his knee and he will teach thee many things and love thee dearly thou wilt love him wilt thou not ,The Scarlet Letter
but whether influenced by the jealousy that seems instinctive with every petted child towards a dangerous rival or from whatever caprice of her freakish nature pearl would show no favor to the clergyman it was only by an exertion of force that her mother brought her up to him hanging back and manifesting her reluctance by odd grimaces of which ever since her babyhood she had possessed a singular variety and could transform her mobile physiognomy into a series of different aspects with a new mischief in them each and all the ministerpainfully embarrassed but hoping that a kiss might prove a talisman to admit him into the childs kindlier regardsbent forward and impressed one on her brow hereupon pearl broke away from her mother and running to the brook stooped over it and bathed her forehead until the unwelcome kiss was quite washed off and diffused through a long lapse of the gliding water she then remained apart silently watching hester and the clergyman while they talked together and made such arrangements as were suggested by their new position and the purposes soon to be fulfilled ,The Scarlet Letter
and now this fateful interview had come to a close the dell was to be left a solitude among its dark old trees which with their multitudinous tongues would whisper long of what had passed there and no mortal be the wiser and the melancholy brook would add this other tale to the mystery with which its little heart was already overburdened and whereof it still kept up a murmuring babble with not a whit more cheerfulness of tone than for ages heretofore ,The Scarlet Letter
as the minister departed in advance of hester prynne and little pearl he threw a backward glance half expecting that he should discover only some faintly traced features or outline of the mother and the child slowly fading into the twilight of the woods so great a vicissitude in his life could not at once be received as real but there was hester clad in her gray robe still standing beside the treetrunk which some blast had overthrown a long antiquity ago and which time had ever since been covering with moss so that these two fated ones with earths heaviest burden on them might there sit down together and find a single hours rest and solace and there was pearl too lightly dancing from the margin of the brooknow that the intrusive third person was goneand taking her old place by her mothers side so the minister had not fallen asleep and dreamed ,The Scarlet Letter
in order to free his mind from this indistinctness and duplicity of impression which vexed it with a strange disquietude he recalled and more thoroughly defined the plans which hester and himself had sketched for their departure it had been determined between them that the old world with its crowds and cities offered them a more eligible shelter and concealment than the wilds of new england or all america with its alternatives of an indian wigwam or the few settlements of europeans scattered thinly along the seaboard not to speak of the clergymans health so inadequate to sustain the hardships of a forest life his native gifts his culture and his entire development would secure him a home only in the midst of civilization and refinement the higher the state the more delicately adapted to it the man in furtherance of this choice it so happened that a ship lay in the harbor one of those questionable cruisers frequent at that day which without being absolutely outlaws of the deep yet roamed over its surface with a remarkable irresponsibility of character this vessel had recently arrived from the spanish main and within three days time would sail for bristol hester prynnewhose vocation as a selfenlisted sister of charity had brought her acquainted with the captain and crewcould take upon herself to secure the passage of two individuals and a child with all the secrecy which circumstances rendered more than desirable ,The Scarlet Letter
the minister had inquired of hester with no little interest the precise time at which the vessel might be expected to depart it would probably be on the fourth day from the present that is most fortunate he had then said to himself now why the reverend mr dimmesdale considered it so very fortunate we hesitate to reveal neverthelessto hold nothing back from the readerit was because on the third day from the present he was to preach the election sermon and as such an occasion formed an honorable epoch in the life of a new england clergyman he could not have chanced upon a more suitable mode and time of terminating his professional career at least they shall say of me thought this exemplary man that i leave no public duty unperformed nor ill performed sad indeed that an introspection so profound and acute as this poor ministers should be so miserably deceived we have had and may still have worse things to tell of him but none we apprehend so pitiably weak no evidence at once so slight and irrefragable of a subtle disease that had long since begun to eat into the real substance of his character no man for any considerable period can wear one face to himself and another to the multitude without finally getting bewildered as to which may be the true ,The Scarlet Letter
the excitement of mr dimmesdales feelings as he returned from his interview with hester lent him unaccustomed physical energy and hurried him townward at a rapid pace the pathway among the woods seemed wilder more uncouth with its rude natural obstacles and less trodden by the foot of man than he remembered it on his outward journey but he leaped across the plashy places thrust himself through the clinging underbrush climbed the ascent plunged into the hollow and overcame in short all the difficulties of the track with an unweariable activity that astonished him he could not but recall how feebly and with what frequent pauses for breath he had toiled over the same ground only two days before as he drew near the town he took an impression of change from the series of familiar objects that presented themselves it seemed not yesterday not one nor two but many days or even years ago since he had quitted them there indeed was each former trace of the street as he remembered it and all the peculiarities of the houses with the due multitude of gablepeaks and a weathercock at every point where his memory suggested one not the less however came this importunately obtrusive sense of change the same was true as regarded the acquaintances whom he met and all the wellknown shapes of human life about the little town they looked neither older nor younger now the beards of the aged were no whiter nor could the creeping babe of yesterday walk on his feet today it was impossible to describe in what respect they differed from the individuals on whom he had so recently bestowed a parting glance and yet the ministers deepest sense seemed to inform him of their mutability a similar impression struck him most remarkably as he passed under the walls of his own church the edifice had so very strange and yet so familiar an aspect that mr dimmesdales mind vibrated between two ideas either that he had seen it only in a dream hitherto or that he was merely dreaming about it now ,The Scarlet Letter
this phenomenon in the various shapes which it assumed indicated no external change but so sudden and important a change in the spectator of the familiar scene that the intervening space of a single day had operated on his consciousness like the lapse of years the ministers own will and hesters will and the fate that grew between them had wrought this transformation it was the same town as heretofore but the same minister returned not from the forest he might have said to the friends who greeted himi am not the man for whom you take me i left him yonder in the forest withdrawn into a secret dell by a mossy treetrunk and near a melancholy brook go seek your minister and see if his emaciated figure his thin cheek his white heavy painwrinkled brow be not flung down there like a castoff garment his friends no doubt would still have insisted with himthou art thyself the manbut the error would have been their own not his ,The Scarlet Letter
before mr dimmesdale reached home his inner man gave him other evidences of a revolution in the sphere of thought and feeling in truth nothing short of a total change of dynasty and moral code in that interior kingdom was adequate to account for the impulses now communicated to the unfortunate and startled minister at every step he was incited to do some strange wild wicked thing or other with a sense that it would be at once involuntary and intentional in spite of himself yet growing out of a profounder self than that which opposed the impulse for instance he met one of his own deacons the good old man addressed him with the paternal affection and patriarchal privilege which his venerable age his upright and holy character and his station in the church entitled him to use and conjoined with this the deep almost worshipping respect which the ministers professional and private claims alike demanded never was there a more beautiful example of how the majesty of age and wisdom may comport with the obeisance and respect enjoined upon it as from a lower social rank and inferior order of endowment towards a higher now during a conversation of some two or three moments between the reverend mr dimmesdale and this excellent and hoarybearded deacon it was only by the most careful selfcontrol that the former could refrain from uttering certain blasphemous suggestions that rose into his mind respecting the communion supper he absolutely trembled and turned pale as ashes lest his tongue should wag itself in utterance of these horrible matters and plead his own consent for so doing without his having fairly given it and even with this terror in his heart he could hardly avoid laughing to imagine how the sanctified old patriarchal deacon would have been petrified by his ministers impiety ,The Scarlet Letter
again another incident of the same nature hurrying along the street the reverend mr dimmesdale encountered the eldest female member of his church a most pious and exemplary old dame poor widowed lonely and with a heart as full of reminiscences about her dead husband and children and her dead friends of long ago as a burialground is full of storied gravestones yet all this which would else have been such heavy sorrow was made almost a solemn joy to her devout old soul by religious consolations and the truths of scripture wherewith she had fed herself continually for more than thirty years and since mr dimmesdale had taken her in charge the good grandams chief earthly comfortwhich unless it had been likewise a heavenly comfort could have been none at allwas to meet her pastor whether casually or of set purpose and be refreshed with a word of warm fragrant heavenbreathing gospel truth from his beloved lips into her dulled but rapturously attentive ear but on this occasion up to the moment of putting his lips to the old womans ear mr dimmesdale as the great enemy of souls would have it could recall no text of scripture nor aught else except a brief pithy and as it then appeared to him unanswerable argument against the immortality of the human soul the instilment thereof into her mind would probably have caused this aged sister to drop down dead at once as by the effect of an intensely poisonous infusion what he really did whisper the minister could never afterwards recollect there was perhaps a fortunate disorder in his utterance which failed to impart any distinct idea to the good widows comprehension or which providence interpreted after a method of its own assuredly as the minister looked back he beheld an expression of divine gratitude and ecstasy that seemed like the shine of the celestial city on her face so wrinkled and ashy pale ,The Scarlet Letter
again a third instance after parting from the old churchmember he met the youngest sister of them all it was a maiden newly wonand won by the reverend mr dimmesdales own sermon on the sabbath after his vigilto barter the transitory pleasures of the world for the heavenly hope that was to assume brighter substance as life grew dark around her and which would gild the utter gloom with final glory she was fair and pure as a lily that had bloomed in paradise the minister knew well that he was himself enshrined within the stainless sanctity of her heart which hung its snowy curtains about his image imparting to religion the warmth of love and to love a religious purity satan that afternoon had surely led the poor young girl away from her mothers side and thrown her into the pathway of this sorely tempted orshall we not rather saythis lost and desperate man as she drew nigh the archfiend whispered him to condense into small compass and drop into her tender bosom a germ of evil that would be sure to blossom darkly soon and bear black fruit betimes such was his sense of power over this virgin soul trusting him as she did that the minister felt potent to blight all the field of innocence with but one wicked look and develop all its opposite with but a word sowith a mightier struggle than he had yet sustainedhe held his geneva cloak before his face and hurried onward making no sign of recognition and leaving the young sister to digest his rudeness as she might she ransacked her consciencewhich was full of harmless little matters like her pocket or her workbagand took herself to task poor thing for a thousand imaginary faults and went about her household duties with swollen eyelids the next morning ,The Scarlet Letter
before the minister had time to celebrate his victory over this last temptation he was conscious of another impulse more ludicrous and almost as horrible it waswe blush to tell itit was to stop short in the road and teach some very wicked words to a knot of little puritan children who were playing there and had but just begun to talk denying himself this freak as unworthy of his cloth he met a drunken seaman one of the ships crew from the spanish main and here since he had so valiantly forborne all other wickedness poor mr dimmesdale longed at least to shake hands with the tarry blackguard and recreate himself with a few improper jests such as dissolute sailors so abound with and a volley of good round solid satisfactory and heavendefying oaths it was not so much a better principle as partly his natural good taste and still more his buckramed habit of clerical decorum that carried him safely through the latter crisis ,The Scarlet Letter
what is it that haunts and tempts me thus cried the minister to himself at length pausing in the street and striking his hand against his forehead am i mad or am i given over utterly to the fiend did i make a contract with him in the forest and sign it with my blood and does he now summon me to its fulfilment by suggesting the performance of every wickedness which his most foul imagination can conceive ,The Scarlet Letter
at the moment when the reverend mr dimmesdale thus communed with himself and struck his forehead with his hand old mistress hibbins the reputed witchlady is said to have been passing by she made a very grand appearance having on a high headdress a rich gown of velvet and a ruff done up with the famous yellow starch of which ann turner her especial friend had taught her the secret before this last good lady had been hanged for sir thomas overburys murder whether the witch had read the ministers thoughts or no she came to a full stop looked shrewdly into his face smiled craftily andthough little given to converse with clergymenbegan a conversation ,The Scarlet Letter
so reverend sir you have made a visit into the forest observed the witchlady nodding her high headdress at him the next time i pray you to allow me only a fair warning and i shall be proud to bear you company without taking overmuch upon myself my good word will go far towards gaining any strange gentleman a fair reception from yonder potentate you wot of ,The Scarlet Letter
i profess madam answered the clergyman with a grave obeisance such as the ladys rank demanded and his own goodbreeding made imperativei profess on my conscience and character that i am utterly bewildered as touching the purport of your words i went not into the forest to seek a potentate neither do i at any future time design a visit thither with a view to gaining the favor of such a personage my one sufficient object was to greet that pious friend of mine the apostle eliot and rejoice with him over the many precious souls he hath won from heathendom ,The Scarlet Letter
ha ha ha cackled the old witchlady still nodding her high headdress at the minister well well we must needs talk thus in the daytime you carry it off like an old hand but at midnight and in the forest we shall have other talk together ,The Scarlet Letter
the wretched minister he had made a bargain very like it tempted by a dream of happiness he had yielded himself with deliberate choice as he had never done before to what he knew was deadly sin and the infectious poison of that sin had been thus rapidly diffused throughout his moral system it had stupefied all blessed impulses and awakened into vivid life the whole brotherhood of bad ones scorn bitterness unprovoked malignity gratuitous desire of ill ridicule of whatever was good and holy all awoke to tempt even while they frightened him and his encounter with old mistress hibbins if it were a real incident did but show his sympathy and fellowship with wicked mortals and the world of perverted spirits ,The Scarlet Letter
he had by this time reached his dwelling on the edge of the burialground and hastening up the stairs took refuge in his study the minister was glad to have reached this shelter without first betraying himself to the world by any of those strange and wicked eccentricities to which he had been continually impelled while passing through the streets he entered the accustomed room and looked around him on its books its windows its fireplace and the tapestried comfort of the walls with the same perception of strangeness that had haunted him throughout his walk from the forestdell into the town and thitherward here he had studied and written here gone through fast and vigil and come forth half alive here striven to pray here borne a hundred thousand agonies there was the bible in its rich old hebrew with moses and the prophets speaking to him and gods voice through all there on the table with the inky pen beside it was an unfinished sermon with a sentence broken in the midst where his thoughts had ceased to gush out upon the page two days before he knew that it was himself the thin and whitecheeked minister who had done and suffered these things and written thus far into the election sermon but he seemed to stand apart and eye this former self with scornful pitying but halfenvious curiosity that self was gone another man had returned out of the forest a wiser one with a knowledge of hidden mysteries which the simplicity of the former never could have reached a bitter kind of knowledge that ,The Scarlet Letter
while occupied with these reflections a knock came at the door of the study and the minister said come innot wholly devoid of an idea that he might behold an evil spirit and so he did it was old roger chillingworth that entered the minister stood white and speechless with one hand on the hebrew scriptures and the other spread upon his breast ,The Scarlet Letter
welcome home reverend sir said the physician and how found you that godly man the apostle eliot but methinks dear sir you look pale as if the travel through the wilderness had been too sore for you will not my aid be requisite to put you in heart and strength to preach your election sermon ,The Scarlet Letter
nay i think not so rejoined the reverend mr dimmesdale my journey and the sight of the holy apostle yonder and the free air which i have breathed have done me good after so long confinement in my study i think to need no more of your drugs my kind physician good though they be and administered by a friendly hand ,The Scarlet Letter
all this time roger chillingworth was looking at the minister with the grave and intent regard of a physician towards his patient but in spite of this outward show the latter was almost convinced of the old mans knowledge or at least his confident suspicion with respect to his own interview with hester prynne the physician knew then that in the ministers regard he was no longer a trusted friend but his bitterest enemy so much being known it would appear natural that a part of it should be expressed it is singular however how long a time often passes before words embody things and with what security two persons who choose to avoid a certain subject may approach its very verge and retire without disturbing it thus the minister felt no apprehension that roger chillingworth would touch in express words upon the real position which they sustained towards one another yet did the physician in his dark way creep frightfully near the secret ,The Scarlet Letter
were it not better said he that you use my poor skill tonight verily dear sir we must take pains to make you strong and vigorous for this occasion of the election discourse the people look for great things from you apprehending that another year may come about and find their pastor gone ,The Scarlet Letter
yea to another world replied the minister with pious resignation heaven grant it be a better one for in good sooth i hardly think to tarry with my flock through the flitting seasons of another year but touching your medicine kind sir in my present frame of body i need it not ,The Scarlet Letter
i joy to hear it answered the physician it may be that my remedies so long administered in vain begin now to take due effect happy man were i and well deserving of new englands gratitude could i achieve this cure ,The Scarlet Letter
left alone the minister summoned a servant of the house and requested food which being set before him he ate with ravenous appetite then flinging the already written pages of the election sermon into the fire he forthwith began another which he wrote with such an impulsive flow of thought and emotion that he fancied himself inspired and only wondered that heaven should see fit to transmit the grand and solemn music of its oracles through so foul an organpipe as he however leaving that mystery to solve itself or go unsolved forever he drove his task onward with earnest haste and ecstasy thus the night fled away as if it were a winged steed and he careering on it morning came and peeped blushing through the curtains and at last sunrise threw a golden beam into the study and laid it right across the ministers bedazzled eyes there he was with the pen still between his fingers and a vast immeasurable tract of written space behind him ,The Scarlet Letter
betimes in the morning of the day on which the new governor was to receive his office at the hands of the people hester prynne and little pearl came into the marketplace it was already thronged with the craftsmen and other plebeian inhabitants of the town in considerable numbers among whom likewise were many rough figures whose attire of deerskins marked them as belonging to some of the forest settlements which surrounded the little metropolis of the colony ,The Scarlet Letter
on this public holiday as on all other occasions for seven years past hester was clad in a garment of coarse gray cloth not more by its hue than by some indescribable peculiarity in its fashion it had the effect of making her fade personally out of sight and outline while again the scarlet letter brought her back from this twilight indistinctness and revealed her under the moral aspect of its own illumination her face so long familiar to the townspeople showed the marble quietude which they were accustomed to behold there it was like a mask or rather like the frozen calmness of a dead womans features owing this dreary resemblance to the fact that hester was actually dead in respect to any claim of sympathy and had departed out of the world with which she still seemed to mingle ,The Scarlet Letter
it might be on this one day that there was an expression unseen before nor indeed vivid enough to be detected now unless some preternaturally gifted observer should have first read the heart and have afterwards sought a corresponding development in the countenance and mien such a spiritual seer might have conceived that after sustaining the gaze of the multitude through seven miserable years as a necessity a penance and something which it was a stern religion to endure she now for one last time more encountered it freely and voluntarily in order to convert what had so long been agony into a kind of triumph look your last on the scarlet letter and its wearerthe peoples victim and lifelong bondslave as they fancied her might say to them yet a little while and she will be beyond your reach a few hours longer and the deep mysterious ocean will quench and hide forever the symbol which ye have caused to burn upon her bosom nor were it an inconsistency too improbable to be assigned to human nature should we suppose a feeling of regret in hesters mind at the moment when she was about to win her freedom from the pain which had been thus deeply incorporated with her being might there not be an irresistible desire to quaff a last long breathless draught of the cup of wormwood and aloes with which nearly all her years of womanhood had been perpetually flavored the wine of life henceforth to be presented to her lips must be indeed rich delicious and exhilarating in its chased and golden beaker or else leave an inevitable and weary languor after the lees of bitterness wherewith she had been drugged as with a cordial of intensest potency ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl was decked out with airy gayety it would have been impossible to guess that this bright and sunny apparition owed its existence to the shape of gloomy gray or that a fancy at once so gorgeous and so delicate as must have been requisite to contrive the childs apparel was the same that had achieved a task perhaps more difficult in imparting so distinct a peculiarity to hesters simple robe the dress so proper was it to little pearl seemed an effluence or inevitable development and outward manifestation of her character no more to be separated from her than the manyhued brilliancy from a butterflys wing or the painted glory from the leaf of a bright flower as with these so with the child her garb was all of one idea with her nature on this eventful day moreover there was a certain singular inquietude and excitement in her mood resembling nothing so much as the shimmer of a diamond that sparkles and flashes with the varied throbbings of the breast on which it is displayed children have always a sympathy in the agitations of those connected with them always especially a sense of any trouble or impending revolution of whatever kind in domestic circumstances and therefore pearl who was the gem on her mothers unquiet bosom betrayed by the very dance of her spirits the emotions which none could detect in the marble passiveness of hesters brow ,The Scarlet Letter
this effervescence made her flit with a birdlike movement rather than walk by her mothers side she broke continually into shouts of a wild inarticulate and sometimes piercing music when they reached the marketplace she became still more restless on perceiving the stir and bustle that enlivened the spot for it was usually more like the broad and lonesome green before a village meetinghouse than the centre of a towns business ,The Scarlet Letter
why what is this mother cried she wherefore have all the people left their work today is it a playday for the whole world see there is the blacksmith he has washed his sooty face and put on his sabbathday clothes and looks as if he would gladly be merry if any kind body would only teach him how and there is master brackett the old jailer nodding and smiling at me why does he do so mother ,The Scarlet Letter
he should not nod and smile at me for all thatthe black grim uglyeyed old man said pearl he may nod at thee if he will for thou art clad in gray and wearest the scarlet letter but see mother how many faces of strange people and indians among them and sailors what have they all come to do here in the marketplace ,The Scarlet Letter
they wait to see the procession pass said hester for the governor and the magistrates are to go by and the ministers and all the great people and good people with the music and the soldiers marching before them ,The Scarlet Letter
what a strange sad man is he said the child as if speaking partly to herself in the dark nighttime he calls us to him and holds thy hand and mine as when we stood with him on the scaffold yonder and in the deep forest where only the old trees can hear and the strip of sky see it he talks with thee sitting on a heap of moss and he kisses my forehead too so that the little brook would hardly wash it off but here in the sunny day and among all the people he knows us not nor must we know him a strange sad man is he with his hand always over his heart ,The Scarlet Letter
be quiet pearl thou understandest not these things said her mother think not now of the minister but look about thee and see how cheery is everybodys face today the children have come from their schools and the grown people from their workshops and their fields on purpose to be happy for today a new man is beginning to rule over them and soas has been the custom of mankind ever since a nation was first gatheredthey make merry and rejoice as if a good and golden year were at length to pass over the poor old world ,The Scarlet Letter
it was as hester said in regard to the unwonted jollity that brightened the faces of the people into this festal season of the yearas it already was and continued to be during the greater part of two centuriesthe puritans compressed whatever mirth and public joy they deemed allowable to human infirmity thereby so far dispelling the customary cloud that for the space of a single holiday they appeared scarcely more grave than most other communities at a period of general affliction ,The Scarlet Letter
but we perhaps exaggerate the gray or sable tinge which undoubtedly characterized the mood and manners of the age the persons now in the marketplace of boston had not been born to an inheritance of puritanic gloom they were native englishmen whose fathers had lived in the sunny richness of the elizabethan epoch a time when the life of england viewed as one great mass would appear to have been as stately magnificent and joyous as the world has ever witnessed had they followed their hereditary taste the new england settlers would have illustrated all events of public importance by bonfires banquets pageantries and processions nor would it have been impracticable in the observance of majestic ceremonies to combine mirthful recreation with solemnity and give as it were a grotesque and brilliant embroidery to the great robe of state which a nation at such festivals puts on there was some shadow of an attempt of this kind in the mode of celebrating the day on which the political year of the colony commenced the dim reflection of a remembered splendor a colorless and manifold diluted repetition of what they had beheld in proud old londonwe will not say at a royal coronation but at a lord mayors showmight be traced in the customs which our forefathers instituted with reference to the annual installation of magistrates the fathers and founders of the commonwealththe statesman the priest and the soldierdeemed it a duty then to assume the outward state and majesty which in accordance with antique style was looked upon as the proper garb of public or social eminence all came forth to move in procession before the peoples eye and thus impart a needed dignity to the simple framework of a government so newly constructed ,The Scarlet Letter
then too the people were countenanced if not encouraged in relaxing the severe and close application to their various modes of rugged industry which at all other times seemed of the same piece and material with their religion here it is true were none of the applicances which popular merriment would so readily have found in the england of elizabeths time or that of jamesno rude shows of a theatrical kind no minstrel with his harp and legendary ballad nor gleeman with an ape dancing to his music no juggler with his tricks of mimic witchcraft no merry andrew to stir up the multitude with jests perhaps hundreds of years old but still effective by their appeals to the very broadest sources of mirthful sympathy all such professors of the several branches of jocularity would have been sternly repressed not only by the rigid discipline of law but by the general sentiment which gives law its vitality not the less however the great honest face of the people smiled grimly perhaps but widely too nor were sports wanting such as the colonists had witnessed and shared in long ago at the country fairs and on the villagegreens of england and which it was thought well to keep alive on this new soil for the sake of the courage and manliness that were essential in them wrestlingmatches in the different fashions of cornwall and devonshire were seen here and there about the marketplace in one corner there was a friendly bout at quarterstaff andwhat attracted most interest of allon the platform of the pillory already so noted in our pages two masters of defence were commencing an exhibition with the buckler and broadsword but much to the disappointment of the crowd this latter business was broken off by the interposition of the town beadle who had no idea of permitting the majesty of the law to be violated by such an abuse of one of its consecrated places ,The Scarlet Letter
it may not be too much to affirm on the whole the people being then in the first stages of joyless deportment and the offspring of sires who had known how to be merry in their day that they would compare favorably in point of holiday keeping with their descendants even at so long an interval as ourselves their immediate posterity the generation next to the early emigrants wore the blackest shade of puritanism and so darkened the national visage with it that all the subsequent years have not sufficed to clear it up we have yet to learn again the forgotten art of gayety ,The Scarlet Letter
the picture of human life in the marketplace though its general tint was the sad gray brown or black of the english emigrants was yet enlivened by some diversity of hue a party of indiansin their savage finery of curiously embroidered deerskin robes wampumbelts red and yellow ochre and feathers and armed with the bow and arrow and stoneheaded spearstood apart with countenances of inflexible gravity beyond what even the puritan aspect could attain nor wild as were these painted barbarians were they the wildest feature of the scene this distinction could more justly be claimed by some marinersa part of the crew of the vessel from the spanish mainwho had come ashore to see the humors of election day they were roughlooking desperadoes with sunblackened faces and an immensity of beard their wide short trousers were confined about the waist by belts often clasped with a rough plate of gold and sustaining always a long knife and in some instances a sword from beneath their broadbrimmed hats of palmleaf gleamed eyes which even in goodnature and merriment had a kind of animal ferocity they transgressed without fear or scruple the rules of behavior that were binding on all others smoking tobacco under the beadles very nose although each whiff would have cost a townsman a shilling and quaffing at their pleasure draughts of wine or aquavit from pocketflasks which they freely tendered to the gaping crowd around them it remarkably characterized the incomplete morality of the age rigid as we call it that a license was allowed the seafaring class not merely for their freaks on shore but for far more desperate deeds on their proper element the sailor of that day would go near to be arraigned as a pirate in our own there could be little doubt for instance that this very ships crew though no unfavorable specimens of the nautical brotherhood had been guilty as we should phrase it of depredations on the spanish commerce such as would have perilled all their necks in a modern court of justice ,The Scarlet Letter
but the sea in those old times heaved swelled and foamed very much at its own will or subject only to the tempestuous wind with hardly any attempts at regulation by human law the buccaneer on the wave might relinquish his calling and become at once if he chose a man of probity and piety on land nor even in the full career of his reckless life was he regarded as a personage with whom it was disreputable to traffic or casually associate thus the puritan elders in their black cloaks starched bands and steeplecrowned hats smiled not unbenignantly at the clamor and rude deportment of these jolly seafaring men and it excited neither surprise nor animadversion when so reputable a citizen as old roger chillingworth the physician was seen to enter the marketplace in close and familiar talk with the commander of the questionable vessel ,The Scarlet Letter
the latter was by far the most showy and gallant figure so far as apparel went anywhere to be seen among the multitude he wore a profusion of ribbons on his garment and goldlace on his hat which was also encircled by a gold chain and surmounted with a feather there was a sword at his side and a swordcut on his forehead which by the arrangement of his hair he seemed anxious rather to display than hide a landsman could hardly have worn this garb and shown this face and worn and shown them both with such a galliard air without undergoing stern question before a magistrate and probably incurring fine or imprisonment or perhaps an exhibition in the stocks as regarded the shipmaster however all was looked upon as pertaining to the character as to a fish his glistening scales ,The Scarlet Letter
after parting from the physician the commander of the bristol ship strolled idly through the marketplace until happening to approach the spot where hester prynne was standing he appeared to recognize and did not hesitate to address her as was usually the case wherever hester stood a small vacant areaa sort of magic circlehad formed itself about her into which though the people were elbowing one another at a little distance none ventured or felt disposed to intrude it was a forcible type of the moral solitude in which the scarlet letter enveloped its fated wearer partly by her own reserve and partly by the instinctive though no longer so unkindly withdrawal of her fellowcreatures now if never before it answered a good purpose by enabling hester and the seaman to speak together without risk of being overheard and so changed was hester prynnes repute before the public that the matron in town most eminent for rigid morality could not have held such intercourse with less result of scandal than herself ,The Scarlet Letter
so mistress said the mariner i must bid the steward make ready one more berth than you bargained for no fear of scurvy or shipfever this voyage what with the ships surgeon and this other doctor our only danger will be from drug or pill more by token as there is a lot of apothecarys stuff aboard which i traded for with a spanish vessel ,The Scarlet Letter
why know you not cried the shipmaster that this physician herechillingworth he calls himselfis minded to try my cabinfare with you ay ay you must have known it for he tells me he is of your party and a close friend to the gentleman you spoke ofhe that is in peril from these sour old puritan rulers ,The Scarlet Letter
nothing further passed between the mariner and hester prynne but at that instant she beheld old roger chillingworth himself standing in the remotest corner of the marketplace and smiling on her a smile whichacross the wide and bustling square and through all the talk and laughter and various thoughts moods and interests of the crowdconveyed secret and fearful meaning ,The Scarlet Letter
before hester prynne could call together her thoughts and consider what was practicable to be done in this new and startling aspect of affairs the sound of military music was heard approaching along a contiguous street it denoted the advance of the procession of magistrates and citizens on its way towards the meetinghouse where in compliance with a custom thus early established and ever since observed the reverend mr dimmesdale was to deliver an election sermon ,The Scarlet Letter
soon the head of the procession showed itself with a slow and stately march turning a corner and making its way across the marketplace first came the music it comprised a variety of instruments perhaps imperfectly adapted to one another and played with no great skill but yet attaining the great object for which the harmony of drum and clarion addresses itself to the multitudethat of imparting a higher and more heroic air to the scene of life that passes before the eye little pearl at first clapped her hands but then lost for an instant the restless agitation that had kept her in a continual effervescence throughout the morning she gazed silently and seemed to be borne upward like a floating seabird on the long heaves and swells of sound but she was brought back to her former mood by the shimmer of the sunshine on the weapons and bright armor of the military company which followed after the music and formed the honorary escort of the procession this body of soldierywhich still sustains a corporate existence and marches down from past ages with an ancient and honorable famewas composed of no mercenary materials its ranks were filled with gentlemen who felt the stirrings of martial impulse and sought to establish a kind of college of arms where as in an association of knights templars they might learn the science and so far as peaceful exercise would teach them the practices of war the high estimation then placed upon the military character might be seen in the lofty port of each individual member of the company some of them indeed by their services in the low countries and on other fields of european warfare had fairly won their title to assume the name and pomp of soldiership the entire array moreover clad in burnished steel and with plumage nodding over their bright morions had a brilliancy of effect which no modern display can aspire to equal ,The Scarlet Letter
and yet the men of civil eminence who came immediately behind the military escort were better worth a thoughtful observers eye even in outward demeanor they showed a stamp of majesty that made the warriors haughty stride look vulgar if not absurd it was an age when what we call talent had far less consideration than now but the massive materials which produce stability and dignity of character a great deal more the people possessed by hereditary right the quality of reverence which in their descendants if it survive at all exists in smaller proportion and with a vastly diminished force in the selection and estimate of public men the change may be for good or ill and is partly perhaps for both in that old day the english settler on these rude shoreshaving left king nobles and all degrees of awful rank behind while still the faculty and necessity of reverence were strong in himbestowed it on the white hair and venerable brow of age on longtried integrity on solid wisdom and sadcolored experience on endowments of that grave and weighty order which gives the idea of permanence and comes under the general definition of respectability these primitive statesmen thereforebradstreet endicott dudley bellingham and their compeerswho were elevated to power by the early choice of the people seem to have been not often brilliant but distinguished by a ponderous sobriety rather than activity of intellect they had fortitude and selfreliance and in time of difficulty or peril stood up for the welfare of the state like a line of cliffs against a tempestuous tide the traits of character here indicated were well represented in the square cast of countenance and large physical development of the new colonial magistrates so far as a demeanor of natural authority was concerned the mother country need not have been ashamed to see these foremost men of an actual democracy adopted into the house of peers or made the privy council of the sovereign ,The Scarlet Letter
next in order to the magistrates came the young and eminently distinguished divine from whose lips the religious discourse of the anniversary was expected his was the profession at that era in which intellectual ability displayed itself far more than in political life forleaving a higher motive out of the questionit offered inducements powerful enough in the almost worshipping respect of the community to win the most aspiring ambition into its service even political poweras in the case of increase matherwas within the grasp of a successful priest ,The Scarlet Letter
it was the observation of those who beheld him now that never since mr dimmesdale first set his foot on the new england shore had he exhibited such energy as was seen in the gait and air with which he kept his pace in the procession there was no feebleness of step as at other times his frame was not bent nor did his hand rest ominously upon his heart yet if the clergyman were rightly viewed his strength seemed not of the body it might be spiritual and imparted to him by angelic ministrations it might be the exhilaration of that potent cordial which is distilled only in the furnaceglow of earnest and longcontinued thought or perchance his sensitive temperament was invigorated by the loud and piercing music that swelled heavenward and uplifted him on its ascending wave nevertheless so abstracted was his look it might be questioned whether mr dimmesdale even heard the music there was his body moving onward and with an unaccustomed force but where was his mind far and deep in its own region busying itself with preternatural activity to marshal a procession of stately thoughts that were soon to issue thence and so he saw nothing heard nothing knew nothing of what was around him but the spiritual element took up the feeble frame and carried it along unconscious of the burden and converting it to spirit like itself men of uncommon intellect who have grown morbid possess this occasional power of mighty effort into which they throw the life of many days and then are lifeless for as many more ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne gazing steadfastly at the clergyman felt a dreary influence come over her but wherefore or whence she knew not unless that he seemed so remote from her own sphere and utterly beyond her reach one glance of recognition she had imagined must needs pass between them she thought of the dim forest with its little dell of solitude and love and anguish and the mossy treetrunk where sitting hand in hand they had mingled their sad and passionate talk with the melancholy murmur of the brook how deeply had they known each other then and was this the man she hardly knew him now he moving proudly past enveloped as it were in the rich music with the procession of majestic and venerable fathers he so unattainable in his worldly position and still more so in that far vista of his unsympathizing thoughts through which she now beheld him her spirit sank with the idea that all must have been a delusion and that vividly as she had dreamed it there could be no real bond betwixt the clergyman and herself and thus much of woman was there in hester that she could scarcely forgive himleast of all now when the heavy footstep of their approaching fate might be heard nearer nearer nearerfor being able so completely to withdraw himself from their mutual world while she groped darkly and stretched forth her cold hands and found him not ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl either saw and responded to her mothers feelings or herself felt the remoteness and intangibility that had fallen around the minister while the procession passed the child was uneasy fluttering up and down like a bird on the point of taking flight when the whole had gone by she looked up into hesters face ,The Scarlet Letter
i could not be sure that it was he so strange he looked continued the child else i would have run to him and bid him kiss me now before all the people even as he did yonder among the dark old trees what would the minister have said mother would he have clapped his hand over his heart and scowled on me and bid me be gone ,The Scarlet Letter
another shade of the same sentiment in reference to mr dimmesdale was expressed by a person whose eccentricitiesor insanity as we should term itled her to do what few of the townspeople would have ventured on to begin a conversation with the wearer of the scarlet letter in public it was mistress hibbins who arrayed in great magnificence with a triple ruff a broidered stomacher a gown of rich velvet and a goldheaded cane had come forth to see the procession as this ancient lady had the renown which subsequently cost her no less a price than her life of being a principal actor in all the works of necromancy that were continually going forward the crowd gave way before her and seemed to fear the touch of her garment as if it carried the plague among its gorgeous folds seen in conjunction with hester prynnekindly as so many now felt towards the latterthe dread inspired by mistress hibbins was doubled and caused a general movement from that part of the marketplace in which the two women stood ,The Scarlet Letter
now what mortal imagination could conceive it whispered the old lady confidentially to hester yonder divine man that saint on earth as the people uphold him to be and asi must needs sayhe really looks who now that saw him pass in the procession would think how little while it is since he went forth out of his studychewing a hebrew text of scripture in his mouth i warrantto take an airing in the forest aha we know what that means hester prynne but truly forsooth i find it hard to believe him the same man many a churchmember saw i walking behind the music that has danced in the same measure with me when somebody was fiddler and it might be an indian powwow or a lapland wizard changing hands with us that is but a trifle when a woman knows the world but this minister couldst thou surely tell hester whether he was the same man that encountered thee on the forestpath ,The Scarlet Letter
madam i know not of what you speak answered hester prynne feeling mistress hibbins to be of infirm mind yet strangely startled and awestricken by the confidence with which she affirmed a personal connection between so many persons herself among them and the evil one it is not for me to talk lightly of a learned and pious minister of the word like the reverend mr dimmesdale ,The Scarlet Letter
fie woman fie cried the old lady shaking her finger at hester dost thou think i have been to the forest so many times and have yet no skill to judge who else has been there yea though no leaf of the wild garlands which they wore while they danced be left in their hair i know thee hester for i behold the token we may all see it in the sunshine and it glows like a red flame in the dark thou wearest it openly so there need be no question about that but this minister let me tell thee in thine ear when the black man sees one of his own servants signed and sealed so shy of owning to the bond as is the reverend mr dimmesdale he hath a way of ordering matters so that the mark shall be disclosed in open daylight to the eyes of all the world what is it that the minister seeks to hide with his hand always over his heart ha hester prynne ,The Scarlet Letter
no matter darling responded mistress hibbins making pearl a profound reverence thou thyself wilt see it one time or another they say child thou art of the lineage of the prince of the air wilt thou ride with me some fine night to see thy father then thou shalt know wherefore the minister keeps his hand over his heart ,The Scarlet Letter
by this time the preliminary prayer had been offered in the meetinghouse and the accents of the reverend mr dimmesdale were heard commencing his discourse an irresistible feeling kept hester near the spot as the sacred edifice was too much thronged to admit another auditor she took up her position close beside the scaffold of the pillory it was in sufficient proximity to bring the whole sermon to her ears in the shape of an indistinct but varied murmur and flow of the ministers very peculiar voice ,The Scarlet Letter
this vocal organ was in itself a rich endowment insomuch that a listener comprehending nothing of the language in which the preacher spoke might still have been swayed to and fro by the mere tone and cadence like all other music it breathed passion and pathos and emotions high or tender in a tongue native to the human heart wherever educated muffled as the sound was by its passage through the churchwalls hester prynne listened with such intentness and sympathized so intimately that the sermon had throughout a meaning for her entirely apart from its indistinguishable words these perhaps if more distinctly heard might have been only a grosser medium and have clogged the spiritual sense now she caught the low undertone as of the wind sinking down to repose itself then ascended with it as it rose through progressive gradations of sweetness and power until its volume seemed to envelop her with an atmosphere of awe and solemn grandeur and yet majestic as the voice sometimes became there was forever in it an essential character of plaintiveness a loud or low expression of anguishthe whisper or the shriek as it might be conceived of suffering humanity that touched a sensibility in every bosom at times this deep strain of pathos was all that could be heard and scarcely heard sighing amid a desolate silence but even when the ministers voice grew high and commandingwhen it gushed irrepressibly upwardwhen it assumed its utmost breadth and power so overfilling the church as to burst its way through the solid walls and diffuse itself in the open airstill if the auditor listened intently and for the purpose he could detect the same cry of pain what was it the complaint of a human heart sorrowladen perchance guilty telling its secret whether of guilt or sorrow to the great heart of mankind beseeching its sympathy or forgivenessat every momentin each accentand never in vain it was this profound and continual undertone that gave the clergyman his most appropriate power ,The Scarlet Letter
during all this time hester stood statuelike at the foot of the scaffold if the ministers voice had not kept her there there would nevertheless have been an inevitable magnetism in that spot whence she dated the first hour of her life of ignominy there was a sense within hertoo illdefined to be made a thought but weighing heavily on her mindthat her whole orb of life both before and after was connected with this spot as with the one point that gave it unity ,The Scarlet Letter
little pearl meanwhile had quitted her mothers side and was playing at her own will about the marketplace she made the sombre crowd cheerful by her erratic and glistening ray even as a bird of bright plumage illuminates a whole tree of dusky foliage by darting to and fro half seen and half concealed amid the twilight of the clustering leaves she had an undulating but oftentimes a sharp and irregular movement it indicated the restless vivacity of her spirit which today was doubly indefatigable in its tiptoe dance because it was played upon and vibrated with her mothers disquietude whenever pearl saw anything to excite her everactive and wandering curiosity she flew thitherward and as we might say seized upon that man or thing as her own property so far as she desired it but without yielding the minutest degree of control over her motions in requital the puritans looked on and if they smiled were none the less inclined to pronounce the child a demon offspring from the indescribable charm of beauty and eccentricity that shone through her little figure and sparkled with its activity she ran and looked the wild indian in the face and he grew conscious of a nature wilder than his own thence with native audacity but still with a reserve as characteristic she flew into the midst of a group of mariners the swarthycheeked wild men of the ocean as the indians were of the land and they gazed wonderingly and admiringly at pearl as if a flake of the seafoam had taken the shape of a little maid and were gifted with a soul of the seafire that flashes beneath the prow in the nighttime ,The Scarlet Letter
one of these seafaring menthe shipmaster indeed who had spoken to hester prynnewas so smitten with pearls aspect that he attempted to lay hands upon her with purpose to snatch a kiss finding it as impossible to touch her as to catch a hummingbird in the air he took from his hat the gold chain that was twisted about it and threw it to the child pearl immediately twined it around her neck and waist with such happy skill that once seen there it became a part of her and it was difficult to imagine her without it ,The Scarlet Letter
then tell her rejoined he that i spake again with the blackavisaged humpshouldered old doctor and he engages to bring his friend the gentleman she wots of aboard with him so let thy mother take no thought save for herself and thee wilt thou tell her this thou witchbaby ,The Scarlet Letter
pursuing a zigzag course across the marketplace the child returned to her mother and communicated what the mariner had said hesters strong calm steadfastly enduring spirit almost sank at last on beholding this dark and grim countenance of an inevitable doom whichat the moment when a passage seemed to open for the minister and herself out of their labyrinth of miseryshowed itself with an unrelenting smile right in the midst of their path ,The Scarlet Letter
with her mind harassed by the terrible perplexity in which the shipmasters intelligence involved her she was also subjected to another trial there were many people present from the country round about who had often heard of the scarlet letter and to whom it had been made terrific by a hundred false or exaggerated rumors but who had never beheld it with their own bodily eyes these after exhausting other modes of amusement now thronged about hester prynne with rude and boorish intrusiveness unscrupulous as it was however it could not bring them nearer than a circuit of several yards at that distance they accordingly stood fixed there by the centrifugal force of the repugnance which the mystic symbol inspired the whole gang of sailors likewise observing the press of spectators and learning the purport of the scarlet letter came and thrust their sunburnt and desperadolooking faces into the ring even the indians were affected by a sort of cold shadow of the white mans curiosity and gliding through the crowd fastened their snakelike black eyes on hesters bosom conceiving perhaps that the wearer of this brilliantly embroidered badge must needs be a personage of high dignity among her people lastly the inhabitants of the town their own interest in this wornout subject languidly reviving itself by sympathy with what they saw others feel lounged idly to the same quarter and tormented hester prynne perhaps more than all the rest with their cool wellacquainted gaze at her familiar shame hester saw and recognized the selfsame faces of that group of matrons who had awaited her forthcoming from the prisondoor seven years ago all save one the youngest and only compassionate among them whose burialrobe she had since made at the final hour when she was so soon to fling aside the burning letter it had strangely become the centre of more remark and excitement and was thus made to sear her breast more painfully than at any time since the first day she put it on ,The Scarlet Letter
while hester stood in that magic circle of ignominy where the cunning cruelty of her sentence seemed to have fixed her forever the admirable preacher was looking down from the sacred pulpit upon an audience whose very inmost spirits had yielded to his control the sainted minister in the church the woman of the scarlet letter in the marketplace what imagination would have been irreverent enough to surmise that the same scorching stigma was on them both ,The Scarlet Letter
the eloquent voice on which the souls of the listening audience had been borne aloft as on the swelling waves of the sea at length came to a pause there was a momentary silence profound as what should follow the utterance of oracles then ensued a murmur and halfhushed tumult as if the auditors released from the high spell that had transported them into the region of anothers mind were returning into themselves with all their awe and wonder still heavy on them in a moment more the crowd began to gush forth from the doors of the church now that there was an end they needed other breath more fit to support the gross and earthly life into which they relapsed than that atmosphere which the preacher had converted into words of flame and had burdened with the rich fragrance of his thought ,The Scarlet Letter
in the open air their rapture broke into speech the street and the marketplace absolutely babbled from side to side with applauses of the minister his hearers could not rest until they had told one another of what each knew better than he could tell or hear according to their united testimony never had man spoken in so wise so high and so holy a spirit as he that spake this day nor had inspiration ever breathed through mortal lips more evidently than it did through his its influence could be seen as it were descending upon him and possessing him and continually lifting him out of the written discourse that lay before him and filling him with ideas that must have been as marvellous to himself as to his audience his subject it appeared had been the relation between the deity and the communities of mankind with a special reference to the new england which they were here planting in the wilderness and as he drew towards the close a spirit as of prophecy had come upon him constraining him to its purpose as mightily as the old prophets of israel were constrained only with this difference that whereas the jewish seers had denounced judgments and ruin on their country it was his mission to foretell a high and glorious destiny for the newly gathered people of the lord but throughout it all and through the whole discourse there had been a certain deep sad undertone of pathos which could not be interpreted otherwise than as the natural regret of one soon to pass away yes their minister whom they so lovedand who so loved them all that he could not depart heavenward without a sighhad the foreboding of untimely death upon him and would soon leave them in their tears this idea of his transitory stay on earth gave the last emphasis to the effect which the preacher had produced it was as if an angel in his passage to the skies had shaken his bright wings over the people for an instantat once a shadow and a splendorand had shed down a shower of golden truths upon them ,The Scarlet Letter
thus there had come to the reverend mr dimmesdaleas to most men in their various spheres though seldom recognized until they see it far behind theman epoch of life more brilliant and full of triumph than any previous one or than any which could hereafter be he stood at this moment on the very proudest eminence of superiority to which the gifts of intellect rich lore prevailing eloquence and a reputation of whitest sanctity could exalt a clergyman in new englands earliest days when the professional character was of itself a lofty pedestal such was the position which the minister occupied as he bowed his head forward on the cushions of the pulpit at the close of his election sermon meanwhile hester prynne was standing beside the scaffold of the pillory with the scarlet letter still burning on her breast ,The Scarlet Letter
now was heard again the clangor of the music and the measured tramp of the military escort issuing from the churchdoor the procession was to be marshalled thence to the townhall where a solemn banquet would complete the ceremonies of the day ,The Scarlet Letter
once more therefore the train of venerable and majestic fathers was seen moving through a broad pathway of the people who drew back reverently on either side as the governor and magistrates the old and wise men the holy ministers and all that were eminent and renowned advanced into the midst of them when they were fairly in the marketplace their presence was greeted by a shout thisthough doubtless it might acquire additional force and volume from the childlike loyalty which the age awarded to its rulerswas felt to be an irrepressible outburst of enthusiasm kindled in the auditors by that high strain of eloquence which was yet reverberating in their ears each felt the impulse in himself and in the same breath caught it from his neighbor within the church it had hardly been kept down beneath the sky it pealed upward to the zenith there were human beings enough and enough of highly wrought and symphonious feeling to produce that more impressive sound than the organ tones of the blast or the thunder or the roar of the sea even that mighty swell of many voices blended into one great voice by the universal impulse which makes likewise one vast heart out of the many never from the soil of new england had gone up such a shout never on new england soil had stood the man so honored by his mortal brethren as the preacher ,The Scarlet Letter
how fared it with him then were there not the brilliant particles of a halo in the air about his head so etherealized by spirit as he was and so apotheosized by worshipping admirers did his footsteps in the procession really tread upon the dust of earth ,The Scarlet Letter
as the ranks of military men and civil fathers moved onward all eyes were turned towards the point where the minister was seen to approach among them the shout died into a murmur as one portion of the crowd after another obtained a glimpse of him how feeble and pale he looked amid all his triumph the energyor say rather the inspiration which had held him up until he should have delivered the sacred message that brought its own strength along with it from heavenwas withdrawn now that it had so faithfully performed its office the glow which they had just before beheld burning on his cheek was extinguished like a flame that sinks down hopelessly among the latedecaying embers it seemed hardly the face of a man alive with such a deathlike hue it was hardly a man with life in him that tottered on his path so nervelessly yet tottered and did not fall ,The Scarlet Letter
one of his clerical brethrenit was the venerable john wilsonobserving the state in which mr dimmesdale was left by the retiring wave of intellect and sensibility stepped forward hastily to offer his support the minister tremulously but decidedly repelled the old mans arm he still walked onward if that movement could be so described which rather resembled the wavering effort of an infant with its mothers arms in view outstretched to tempt him forward and now almost imperceptible as were the latter steps of his progress he had come opposite the wellremembered and weatherdarkened scaffold where long since with all that dreary lapse of time between hester prynne had encountered the worlds ignominious stare there stood hester holding little pearl by the hand and there was the scarlet letter on her breast the minister here made a pause although the music still played the stately and rejoicing march to which the procession moved it summoned him onwardonward to the festivalbut here he made a pause ,The Scarlet Letter
bellingham for the last few moments had kept an anxious eye upon him he now left his own place in the procession and advanced to give assistance judging from mr dimmesdales aspect that he must otherwise inevitably fall but there was something in the latters expression that warned back the magistrate although a man not readily obeying the vague intimations that pass from one spirit to another the crowd meanwhile looked on with awe and wonder this earthly faintness was in their view only another phase of the ministers celestial strength nor would it have seemed a miracle too high to be wrought for one so holy had he ascended before their eyes waxing dimmer and brighter and fading at last into the light of heaven ,The Scarlet Letter
it was a ghastly look with which he regarded them but there was something at once tender and strangely triumphant in it the child with the birdlike motion which was one of her characteristics flew to him and clasped her arms about his knees hester prynneslowly as if impelled by inevitable fate and against her strongest willlikewise drew near but paused before she reached him at this instant old roger chillingworth thrust himself through the crowdor perhaps so dark disturbed and evil was his look he rose up out of some nether regionto snatch back his victim from what he sought to do be that as it might the old man rushed forward and caught the minister by the arm ,The Scarlet Letter
madman hold what is your purpose whispered he wave back that woman cast off this child all shall be well do not blacken your fame and perish in dishonor i can yet save you would you bring infamy on your sacred profession ,The Scarlet Letter
hester prynne cried he with a piercing earnestness in the name of him so terrible and so merciful who gives me grace at this last moment to do whatfor my own heavy sin and miserable agonyi withheld myself from doing seven years ago come hither now and twine thy strength about me thy strength hester but let it be guided by the will which god hath granted me this wretched and wronged old man is opposing it with all his mightwith all his own might and the fiends come hester come support me up yonder scaffold ,The Scarlet Letter
the crowd was in a tumult the men of rank and dignity who stood more immediately around the clergyman were so taken by surprise and so perplexed as to the purport of what they sawunable to receive the explanation which most readily presented itself or to imagine any otherthat they remained silent and inactive spectators of the judgment which providence seemed about to work they beheld the minister leaning on hesters shoulder and supported by her arm around him approach the scaffold and ascend its steps while still the little hand of the sinborn child was clasped in his old roger chillingworth followed as one intimately connected with the drama of guilt and sorrow in which they had all been actors and well entitled therefore to be present at its closing scene ,The Scarlet Letter
hadst thou sought the whole earth over said he looking darkly at the clergyman there was no one place so secretno high place nor lowly place where thou couldst have escaped mesave on this very scaffold ,The Scarlet Letter
for thee and pearl be it as god shall order said the minister and god is merciful let me now do the will which he hath made plain before my sight for hester i am a dying man so let me make haste to take my shame upon me ,The Scarlet Letter
partly supported by hester prynne and holding one hand of little pearls the reverend mr dimmesdale turned to the dignified and venerable rulers to the holy ministers who were his brethren to the people whose great heart was thoroughly appalled yet overflowing with tearful sympathy as knowing that some deep lifematterwhich if full of sin was full of anguish and repentance likewisewas now to be laid open to them the sun but little past its meridian shone down upon the clergyman and gave a distinctness to his figure as he stood out from all the earth to put in his plea of guilty at the bar of eternal justice ,The Scarlet Letter
people of new england cried he with a voice that rose over them high solemn and majesticyet had always a tremor through it and sometimes a shriek struggling up out of a fathomless depth of remorse and woeye that have loved meye that have deemed me holybehold me here the one sinner of the world at lastat lasti stand upon the spot where seven years since i should have stood here with this woman whose arm more than the little strength wherewith i have crept hitherward sustains me at this dreadful moment from grovelling down upon my face lo the scarlet letter which hester wears ye have all shuddered at it wherever her walk hath beenwherever so miserably burdened she may have hoped to find reposeit hath cast a lurid gleam of awe and horrible repugnance round about her but there stood one in the midst of you at whose brand of sin and infamy ye have not shuddered ,The Scarlet Letter
it seemed at this point as if the minister must leave the remainder of his secret undisclosed but he fought back the bodily weaknessand still more the faintness of heartthat was striving for the mastery with him he threw off all assistance and stepped passionately forward a pace before the woman and the child ,The Scarlet Letter
it was on him he continued with a kind of fierceness so determined was he to speak out the whole gods eye beheld it the angels were forever pointing at it the devil knew it well and fretted it continually with the touch of his burning finger but he hid it cunningly from men and walked among you with the mien of a spirit mournful because so pure in a sinful worldand sad because he missed his heavenly kindred now at the deathhour he stands up before you he bids you look again at hesters scarlet letter he tells you that with all its mysterious horror it is but the shadow of what he bears on his own breast and that even this his own red stigma is no more than the type of what has seared his inmost heart stand any here that question gods judgment on a sinner behold behold a dreadful witness of it ,The Scarlet Letter
with a convulsive motion he tore away the ministerial band from before his breast it was revealed but it were irreverent to describe that revelation for an instant the gaze of the horrorstricken multitude was concentred on the ghastly miracle while the minister stood with a flush of triumph in his face as one who in the crisis of acutest pain had won a victory then down he sank upon the scaffold hester partly raised him and supported his head against her bosom old roger chillingworth knelt down beside him with a blank dull countenance out of which the life seemed to have departed ,The Scarlet Letter
my little pearl said he feeblyand there was a sweet and gentle smile over his face as of a spirit sinking into deep repose nay now that the burden was removed it seemed almost as if he would be sportive with the childdear little pearl wilt thou kiss me now thou wouldst not yonder in the forest but now thou wilt ,The Scarlet Letter
pearl kissed his lips a spell was broken the great scene of grief in which the wild infant bore a part had developed all her sympathies and as her tears fell upon her fathers cheek they were the pledge that she would grow up amid human joy and sorrow nor forever do battle with the world but be a woman in it towards her mother too pearls errand as a messenger of anguish was all fulfilled ,The Scarlet Letter
shall we not meet again whispered she bending her face down close to his shall we not spend our immortal life together surely surely we have ransomed one another with all this woe thou lookest far into eternity with those bright dying eyes then tell me what thou seest ,The Scarlet Letter
hush hester hush said he with tremulous solemnity the law we brokethe sin here so awfully revealedlet these alone be in thy thoughts i fear i fear it may be that when we forgot our godwhen we violated our reverence each for the others soulit was thenceforth vain to hope that we could meet hereafter in an everlasting and pure reunion god knows and he is merciful he hath proved his mercy most of all in my afflictions by giving me this burning torture to bear upon my breast by sending yonder dark and terrible old man to keep the torture always at redheat by bringing me hither to die this death of triumphant ignominy before the people had either of these agonies been wanting i had been lost forever praised be his name his will be done farewell ,The Scarlet Letter
that final word came forth with the ministers expiring breath the multitude silent till then broke out in a strange deep voice of awe and wonder which could not as yet find utterance save in this murmur that rolled so heavily after the departed spirit ,The Scarlet Letter
most of the spectators testified to having seen on the breast of the unhappy minister a scarlet letterthe very semblance of that worn by hester prynneimprinted in the flesh as regarded its origin there were various explanations all of which must necessarily have been conjectural some affirmed that the reverend mr dimmesdale on the very day when hester prynne first wore her ignominious badge had begun a course of penancewhich he afterwards in so many futile methods followed outby inflicting a hideous torture on himself others contended that the stigma had not been produced until a long time subsequent when old roger chillingworth being a potent necromancer had caused it to appear through the agency of magic and poisonous drugs others againand those best able to appreciate the ministers peculiar sensibility and the wonderful operation of his spirit upon the bodywhispered their belief that the awful symbol was the effect of the everactive tooth of remorse gnawing from the inmost heart outwardly and at last manifesting heavens dreadful judgment by the visible presence of the letter the reader may choose among these theories we have thrown all the light we could acquire upon the portent and would gladly now that it has done its office erase its deep print out of our own brain where long meditation has fixed it in very undesirable distinctness ,The Scarlet Letter
it is singular nevertheless that certain persons who were spectators of the whole scene and professed never once to have removed their eyes from the reverend mr dimmesdale denied that there was any mark whatever on his breast more than on a newborn infants neither by their report had his dying words acknowledged nor even remotely implied any the slightest connection on his part with the guilt for which hester prynne had so long worn the scarlet letter according to these highly respectable witnesses the minister conscious that he was dyingconscious also that the reverence of the multitude placed him already among saints and angelshad desired by yielding up his breath in the arms of that fallen woman to express to the world how utterly nugatory is the choicest of mans own righteousness after exhausting life in his efforts for mankinds spiritual good he had made the manner of his death a parable in order to impress on his admirers the mighty and mournful lesson that in the view of infinite purity we are sinners all alike it was to teach them that the holiest among us has but attained so far above his fellows as to discern more clearly the mercy which looks down and repudiate more utterly the phantom of human merit which would look aspiringly upward without disputing a truth so momentous we must be allowed to consider this version of mr dimmesdales story as only an instance of that stubborn fidelity with which a mans friendsand especially a clergymanswill sometimes uphold his character when proofs clear as the midday sunshine on the scarlet letter establish him a false and sinstained creature of the dust ,The Scarlet Letter
the authority which we have chiefly followeda manuscript of old date drawn up from the verbal testimony of individuals some of whom had known hester prynne while others had heard the tale from contemporary witnessesfully confirms the view taken in the foregoing pages among many morals which press upon us from the poor ministers miserable experience we put only this into a sentencebe true be true be true show freely to the world if not your worst yet some trait whereby the worst may be inferred ,The Scarlet Letter
nothing was more remarkable than the change which took place almost immediately after mr dimmesdales death in the appearance and demeanor of the old man known as roger chillingworth all his strength and energyall his vital and intellectual forceseemed at once to desert him insomuch that he positively withered up shrivelled away and almost vanished from mortal sight like an uprooted weed that lies wilting in the sun this unhappy man had made the very principle of his life to consist in the pursuit and systematic exercise of revenge and when by its completest triumph and consummation that evil principle was left with no further material to support it when in short there was no more devils work on earth for him to do it only remained for the unhumanized mortal to betake himself whither his master would find him tasks enough and pay him his wages duly but to all these shadowy beings so long our near acquaintancesas well roger chillingworth as his companionswe would fain be merciful it is a curious subject of observation and inquiry whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom each in its utmost development supposes a high degree of intimacy and heartknowledge each renders one individual dependent for the food of his affections and spiritual life upon another each leaves the passionate lover or the no less passionate hater forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject philosophically considered therefore the two passions seem essentially the same except that one happens to be seen in a celestial radiance and the other in a dusky and lurid glow in the spiritual world the old physician and the ministermutual victims as they have beenmay unawares have found their earthly stock of hatred and antipathy transmuted into golden love ,The Scarlet Letter
leaving this discussion apart we have a matter of business to communicate to the reader at old roger chillingworths decease which took place within the year and by his last will and testament of which governor bellingham and the reverend mr wilson were executors he bequeathed a very considerable amount of property both here and in england to little pearl the daughter of hester prynne ,The Scarlet Letter
so pearlthe elfchildthe demon offspring as some people up to that epoch persisted in considering herbecame the richest heiress of her day in the new world not improbably this circumstance wrought a very material change in the public estimation and had the mother and child remained here little pearl at a marriageable period of life might have mingled her wild blood with the lineage of the devoutest puritan among them all but in no long time after the physicians death the wearer of the scarlet letter disappeared and pearl along with her for many years though a vague report would now and then find its way across the sealike a shapeless piece of driftwood tost ashore with the initials of a name upon ityet no tidings of them unquestionably authentic were received the story of the scarlet letter grew into a legend its spell however was still potent and kept the scaffold awful where the poor minister had died and likewise the cottage by the seashore where hester prynne had dwelt near this latter spot one afternoon some children were at play when they beheld a tall woman in a gray robe approach the cottagedoor in all those years it had never once been opened but either she unlocked it or the decaying wood and iron yielded to her hand or she glided shadowlike through these impedimentsand at all events went in ,The Scarlet Letter
on the threshold she pausedturned partly roundfor perchance the idea of entering all alone and all so changed the home of so intense a former life was more dreary and desolate than even she could bear but her hesitation was only for an instant though long enough to display a scarlet letter on her breast ,The Scarlet Letter
and hester prynne had returned and taken up her longforsaken shame but where was little pearl if still alive she must now have been in the flush and bloom of early womanhood none knewnor ever learned with the fulness of perfect certaintywhether the elfchild had gone thus untimely to a maiden grave or whether her wild rich nature had been softened and subdued and made capable of a womans gentle happiness but through the remainder of hesters life there were indications that the recluse of the scarlet letter was the object of love and interest with some inhabitant of another land letters came with armorial seals upon them though of bearings unknown to english heraldry in the cottage there were articles of comfort and luxury such as hester never cared to use but which only wealth could have purchased and affection have imagined for her there were trifles too little ornaments beautiful tokens of a continual remembrance that must have been wrought by delicate fingers at the impulse of a fond heart and once hester was seen embroidering a babygarment with such a lavish richness of golden fancy as would have raised a public tumult had any infant thus apparelled been shown to our soberhued community ,The Scarlet Letter
in fine the gossips of that day believedand mr surveyor pue who made investigations a century later believedand one of his recent successors in office moreover faithfully believesthat pearl was not only alive but married and happy and mindful of her mother and that she would most joyfully have entertained that sad and lonely mother at her fireside ,The Scarlet Letter
but there was a more real life for hester prynne here in new england than in that unknown region where pearl had found a home here had been her sin here her sorrow and here was yet to be her penitence she had returned therefore and resumedof her own free will for not the sternest magistrate of that iron period would have imposed itresumed the symbol of which we have related so dark a tale never afterwards did it quit her bosom but in the lapse of the toilsome thoughtful and selfdevoted years that made up hesters life the scarlet letter ceased to be a stigma which attracted the worlds scorn and bitterness and became a type of something to be sorrowed over and looked upon with awe yet with reverence too and as hester prynne had no selfish ends nor lived in any measure for her own profit and enjoyment people brought all their sorrows and perplexities and besought her counsel as one who had herself gone through a mighty trouble women more especiallyin the continually recurring trials of wounded wasted wronged misplaced or erring and sinful passionor with the dreary burden of a heart unyielded because unvalued and unsoughtcame to hesters cottage demanding why they were so wretched and what the remedy hester comforted and counselled them as best she might she assured them too of her firm belief that at some brighter period when the world should have grown ripe for it in heavens own time a new truth would be revealed in order to establish the whole relation between man and woman on a surer ground of mutual happiness earlier in life hester had vainly imagined that she herself might be the destined prophetess but had long since recognized the impossibility that any mission of divine and mysterious truth should be confided to a woman stained with sin bowed down with shame or even burdened with a lifelong sorrow the angel and apostle of the coming revelation must be a woman indeed but lofty pure and beautiful and wise moreover not through dusky grief but the ethereal medium of joy and showing how sacred love should make us happy by the truest test of a life successful to such an end ,The Scarlet Letter
so said hester prynne and glanced her sad eyes downward at the scarlet letter and after many many years a new grave was delved near an old and sunken one in that burialground beside which kings chapel has since been built it was near that old and sunken grave yet with a space between as if the dust of the two sleepers had no right to mingle yet one tombstone served for both all around there were monuments carved with armorial bearings and on this simple slab of slateas the curious investigator may still discern and perplex himself with the purportthere appeared the semblance of an engraved escutcheon it bore a device a heralds wording of which might serve for a motto and brief description of our now concluded legend so sombre is it and relieved only by one everglowing point of light gloomier than the shadow ,The Scarlet Letter

marley was dead to begin with there is no doubt whatever about that the register of his burial was signed by the clergyman the clerk the undertaker and the chief mourner scrooge signed it and scrooges name was good upon change for anything he chose to put his hand to old marley was as dead as a doornail ,A Christmas Carol
mind i dont mean to say that i know of my own knowledge what there is particularly dead about a doornail i might have been inclined myself to regard a coffinnail as the deadest piece of ironmongery in the trade but the wisdom of our ancestors is in the simile and my unhallowed hands shall not disturb it or the countrys done for you will therefore permit me to repeat emphatically that marley was as dead as a doornail ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge knew he was dead of course he did how could it be otherwise scrooge and he were partners for i dont know how many years scrooge was his sole executor his sole administrator his sole assign his sole residuary legatee his sole friend and sole mourner and even scrooge was not so dreadfully cut up by the sad event but that he was an excellent man of business on the very day of the funeral and solemnised it with an undoubted bargain ,A Christmas Carol
the mention of marleys funeral brings me back to the point i started from there is no doubt that marley was dead this must be distinctly understood or nothing wonderful can come of the story i am going to relate if we were not perfectly convinced that hamlets father died before the play began there would be nothing more remarkable in his taking a stroll at night in an easterly wind upon his own ramparts than there would be in any other middleaged gentleman rashly turning out after dark in a breezy spotsay saint pauls churchyard for instance literally to astonish his sons weak mind ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge never painted out old marleys name there it stood years afterwards above the warehouse door scrooge and marley the firm was known as scrooge and marley sometimes people new to the business called scrooge scrooge and sometimes marley but he answered to both names it was all the same to him ,A Christmas Carol
oh but he was a tightfisted hand at the grindstone scrooge a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner hard and sharp as flint from which no steel had ever struck out generous fire secret and selfcontained and solitary as an oyster the cold within him froze his old features nipped his pointed nose shrivelled his cheek stiffened his gait made his eyes red his thin lips blue and spoke out shrewdly in his grating voice a frosty rime was on his head and on his eyebrows and his wiry chin he carried his own low temperature always about with him he iced his office in the dogdays and didnt thaw it one degree at christmas ,A Christmas Carol
external heat and cold had little influence on scrooge no warmth could warm no wintry weather chill him no wind that blew was bitterer than he no falling snow was more intent upon its purpose no pelting rain less open to entreaty foul weather didnt know where to have him the heaviest rain and snow and hail and sleet could boast of the advantage over him in only one respect they often came down handsomely and scrooge never did ,A Christmas Carol
nobody ever stopped him in the street to say with gladsome looks my dear scrooge how are you when will you come to see me no beggars implored him to bestow a trifle no children asked him what it was oclock no man or woman ever once in all his life inquired the way to such and such a place of scrooge even the blind mens dogs appeared to know him and when they saw him coming on would tug their owners into doorways and up courts and then would wag their tails as though they said no eye at all is better than an evil eye dark master ,A Christmas Carol
but what did scrooge care it was the very thing he liked to edge his way along the crowded paths of life warning all human sympathy to keep its distance was what the knowing ones call nuts to scrooge ,A Christmas Carol
once upon a timeof all the good days in the year on christmas eveold scrooge sat busy in his countinghouse it was cold bleak biting weather foggy withal and he could hear the people in the court outside go wheezing up and down beating their hands upon their breasts and stamping their feet upon the pavement stones to warm them the city clocks had only just gone three but it was quite dark already it had not been light all dayand candles were flaring in the windows of the neighbouring offices like ruddy smears upon the palpable brown air the fog came pouring in at every chink and keyhole and was so dense without that although the court was of the narrowest the houses opposite were mere phantoms to see the dingy cloud come drooping down obscuring everything one might have thought that nature lived hard by and was brewing on a large scale ,A Christmas Carol
the door of scrooges countinghouse was open that he might keep his eye upon his clerk who in a dismal little cell beyond a sort of tank was copying letters scrooge had a very small fire but the clerks fire was so very much smaller that it looked like one coal but he couldnt replenish it for scrooge kept the coalbox in his own room and so surely as the clerk came in with the shovel the master predicted that it would be necessary for them to part wherefore the clerk put on his white comforter and tried to warm himself at the candle in which effort not being a man of a strong imagination he failed ,A Christmas Carol
a merry christmas uncle god save you cried a cheerful voice it was the voice of scrooges nephew who came upon him so quickly that this was the first intimation he had of his approach ,A Christmas Carol
he had so heated himself with rapid walking in the fog and frost this nephew of scrooges that he was all in a glow his face was ruddy and handsome his eyes sparkled and his breath smoked again ,A Christmas Carol
what else can i be returned the uncle when i live in such a world of fools as this merry christmas out upon merry christmas whats christmas time to you but a time for paying bills without money a time for finding yourself a year older but not an hour richer a time for balancing your books and having every item in em through a round dozen of months presented dead against you if i could work my will said scrooge indignantly every idiot who goes about with merry christmas on his lips should be boiled with his own pudding and buried with a stake of holly through his heart he should ,A Christmas Carol
there are many things from which i might have derived good by which i have not profited i dare say returned the nephew christmas among the rest but i am sure i have always thought of christmas time when it has come roundapart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin if anything belonging to it can be apart from thatas a good time a kind forgiving charitable pleasant time the only time i know of in the long calendar of the year when men and women seem by one consent to open their shutup hearts freely and to think of people below them as if they really were fellowpassengers to the grave and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys and therefore uncle though it has never put a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket i believe that it has done me good and will do me good and i say god bless it ,A Christmas Carol
the clerk in the tank involuntarily applauded becoming immediately sensible of the impropriety he poked the fire and extinguished the last frail spark for ever ,A Christmas Carol
let me hear another sound from you said scrooge and youll keep your christmas by losing your situation youre quite a powerful speaker sir he added turning to his nephew i wonder you dont go into parliament ,A Christmas Carol
i am sorry with all my heart to find you so resolute we have never had any quarrel to which i have been a party but i have made the trial in homage to christmas and ill keep my christmas humour to the last so a merry christmas uncle ,A Christmas Carol
his nephew left the room without an angry word notwithstanding he stopped at the outer door to bestow the greetings of the season on the clerk who cold as he was was warmer than scrooge for he returned them cordially ,A Christmas Carol
theres another fellow muttered scrooge who overheard him my clerk with fifteen shillings a week and a wife and family talking about a merry christmas ill retire to bedlam ,A Christmas Carol
this lunatic in letting scrooges nephew out had let two other people in they were portly gentlemen pleasant to behold and now stood with their hats off in scrooges office they had books and papers in their hands and bowed to him ,A Christmas Carol
it certainly was for they had been two kindred spirits at the ominous word liberality scrooge frowned and shook his head and handed the credentials back ,A Christmas Carol
at this festive season of the year mr scrooge said the gentleman taking up a pen it is more than usually desirable that we should make some slight provision for the poor and destitute who suffer greatly at the present time many thousands are in want of common necessaries hundreds of thousands are in want of common comforts sir ,A Christmas Carol
oh i was afraid from what you said at first that something had occurred to stop them in their useful course said scrooge im very glad to hear it ,A Christmas Carol
under the impression that they scarcely furnish christian cheer of mind or body to the multitude returned the gentleman a few of us are endeavouring to raise a fund to buy the poor some meat and drink and means of warmth we choose this time because it is a time of all others when want is keenly felt and abundance rejoices what shall i put you down for ,A Christmas Carol
i wish to be left alone said scrooge since you ask me what i wish gentlemen that is my answer i dont make merry myself at christmas and i cant afford to make idle people merry i help to support the establishments i have mentionedthey cost enough and those who are badly off must go there ,A Christmas Carol
its not my business scrooge returned its enough for a man to understand his own business and not to interfere with other peoples mine occupies me constantly good afternoon gentlemen ,A Christmas Carol
seeing clearly that it would be useless to pursue their point the gentlemen withdrew scrooge resumed his labours with an improved opinion of himself and in a more facetious temper than was usual with him ,A Christmas Carol
meanwhile the fog and darkness thickened so that people ran about with flaring links proffering their services to go before horses in carriages and conduct them on their way the ancient tower of a church whose gruff old bell was always peeping slily down at scrooge out of a gothic window in the wall became invisible and struck the hours and quarters in the clouds with tremulous vibrations afterwards as if its teeth were chattering in its frozen head up there the cold became intense in the main street at the corner of the court some labourers were repairing the gaspipes and had lighted a great fire in a brazier round which a party of ragged men and boys were gathered warming their hands and winking their eyes before the blaze in rapture the waterplug being left in solitude its overflowings sullenly congealed and turned to misanthropic ice the brightness of the shops where holly sprigs and berries crackled in the lamp heat of the windows made pale faces ruddy as they passed poulterers and grocers trades became a splendid joke a glorious pageant with which it was next to impossible to believe that such dull principles as bargain and sale had anything to do the lord mayor in the stronghold of the mighty mansion house gave orders to his fifty cooks and butlers to keep christmas as a lord mayors household should and even the little tailor whom he had fined five shillings on the previous monday for being drunk and bloodthirsty in the streets stirred up tomorrows pudding in his garret while his lean wife and the baby sallied out to buy the beef ,A Christmas Carol
foggier yet and colder piercing searching biting cold if the good saint dunstan had but nipped the evil spirits nose with a touch of such weather as that instead of using his familiar weapons then indeed he would have roared to lusty purpose the owner of one scant young nose gnawed and mumbled by the hungry cold as bones are gnawed by dogs stooped down at scrooges keyhole to regale him with a christmas carol but at the first sound of ,A Christmas Carol
at length the hour of shutting up the countinghouse arrived with an illwill scrooge dismounted from his stool and tacitly admitted the fact to the expectant clerk in the tank who instantly snuffed his candle out and put on his hat ,A Christmas Carol
a poor excuse for picking a mans pocket every twentyfifth of december said scrooge buttoning his greatcoat to the chin but i suppose you must have the whole day be here all the earlier next morning ,A Christmas Carol
the clerk promised that he would and scrooge walked out with a growl the office was closed in a twinkling and the clerk with the long ends of his white comforter dangling below his waist for he boasted no greatcoat went down a slide on cornhill at the end of a lane of boys twenty times in honour of its being christmas eve and then ran home to camden town as hard as he could pelt to play at blindmansbuff ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge took his melancholy dinner in his usual melancholy tavern and having read all the newspapers and beguiled the rest of the evening with his bankersbook went home to bed he lived in chambers which had once belonged to his deceased partner they were a gloomy suite of rooms in a lowering pile of building up a yard where it had so little business to be that one could scarcely help fancying it must have run there when it was a young house playing at hideandseek with other houses and forgotten the way out again it was old enough now and dreary enough for nobody lived in it but scrooge the other rooms being all let out as offices the yard was so dark that even scrooge who knew its every stone was fain to grope with his hands the fog and frost so hung about the black old gateway of the house that it seemed as if the genius of the weather sat in mournful meditation on the threshold ,A Christmas Carol
now it is a fact that there was nothing at all particular about the knocker on the door except that it was very large it is also a fact that scrooge had seen it night and morning during his whole residence in that place also that scrooge had as little of what is called fancy about him as any man in the city of london even includingwhich is a bold wordthe corporation aldermen and livery let it also be borne in mind that scrooge had not bestowed one thought on marley since his last mention of his seven years dead partner that afternoon and then let any man explain to me if he can how it happened that scrooge having his key in the lock of the door saw in the knocker without its undergoing any intermediate process of changenot a knocker but marleys face ,A Christmas Carol
marleys face it was not in impenetrable shadow as the other objects in the yard were but had a dismal light about it like a bad lobster in a dark cellar it was not angry or ferocious but looked at scrooge as marley used to look with ghostly spectacles turned up on its ghostly forehead the hair was curiously stirred as if by breath or hot air and though the eyes were wide open they were perfectly motionless that and its livid colour made it horrible but its horror seemed to be in spite of the face and beyond its control rather than a part of its own expression ,A Christmas Carol
to say that he was not startled or that his blood was not conscious of a terrible sensation to which it had been a stranger from infancy would be untrue but he put his hand upon the key he had relinquished turned it sturdily walked in and lighted his candle ,A Christmas Carol
he did pause with a moments irresolution before he shut the door and he did look cautiously behind it first as if he half expected to be terrified with the sight of marleys pigtail sticking out into the hall but there was nothing on the back of the door except the screws and nuts that held the knocker on so he said pooh pooh and closed it with a bang ,A Christmas Carol
the sound resounded through the house like thunder every room above and every cask in the winemerchants cellars below appeared to have a separate peal of echoes of its own scrooge was not a man to be frightened by echoes he fastened the door and walked across the hall and up the stairs slowly too trimming his candle as he went ,A Christmas Carol
you may talk vaguely about driving a coachandsix up a good old flight of stairs or through a bad young act of parliament but i mean to say you might have got a hearse up that staircase and taken it broadwise with the splinterbar towards the wall and the door towards the balustrades and done it easy there was plenty of width for that and room to spare which is perhaps the reason why scrooge thought he saw a locomotive hearse going on before him in the gloom halfadozen gaslamps out of the street wouldnt have lighted the entry too well so you may suppose that it was pretty dark with scrooges dip ,A Christmas Carol
up scrooge went not caring a button for that darkness is cheap and scrooge liked it but before he shut his heavy door he walked through his rooms to see that all was right he had just enough recollection of the face to desire to do that ,A Christmas Carol
sittingroom bedroom lumberroom all as they should be nobody under the table nobody under the sofa a small fire in the grate spoon and basin ready and the little saucepan of gruel scrooge had a cold in his head upon the hob nobody under the bed nobody in the closet nobody in his dressinggown which was hanging up in a suspicious attitude against the wall lumberroom as usual old fireguard old shoes two fishbaskets washingstand on three legs and a poker ,A Christmas Carol
quite satisfied he closed his door and locked himself in doublelocked himself in which was not his custom thus secured against surprise he took off his cravat put on his dressinggown and slippers and his nightcap and sat down before the fire to take his gruel ,A Christmas Carol
it was a very low fire indeed nothing on such a bitter night he was obliged to sit close to it and brood over it before he could extract the least sensation of warmth from such a handful of fuel the fireplace was an old one built by some dutch merchant long ago and paved all round with quaint dutch tiles designed to illustrate the scriptures there were cains and abels pharaohs daughters queens of sheba angelic messengers descending through the air on clouds like featherbeds abrahams belshazzars apostles putting off to sea in butterboats hundreds of figures to attract his thoughts and yet that face of marley seven years dead came like the ancient prophets rod and swallowed up the whole if each smooth tile had been a blank at first with power to shape some picture on its surface from the disjointed fragments of his thoughts there would have been a copy of old marleys head on every one ,A Christmas Carol
after several turns he sat down again as he threw his head back in the chair his glance happened to rest upon a bell a disused bell that hung in the room and communicated for some purpose now forgotten with a chamber in the highest story of the building it was with great astonishment and with a strange inexplicable dread that as he looked he saw this bell begin to swing it swung so softly in the outset that it scarcely made a sound but soon it rang out loudly and so did every bell in the house ,A Christmas Carol
this might have lasted half a minute or a minute but it seemed an hour the bells ceased as they had begun together they were succeeded by a clanking noise deep down below as if some person were dragging a heavy chain over the casks in the winemerchants cellar scrooge then remembered to have heard that ghosts in haunted houses were described as dragging chains ,A Christmas Carol
the cellardoor flew open with a booming sound and then he heard the noise much louder on the floors below then coming up the stairs then coming straight towards his door ,A Christmas Carol
his colour changed though when without a pause it came on through the heavy door and passed into the room before his eyes upon its coming in the dying flame leaped up as though it cried i know him marleys ghost and fell again ,A Christmas Carol
the same face the very same marley in his pigtail usual waistcoat tights and boots the tassels on the latter bristling like his pigtail and his coatskirts and the hair upon his head the chain he drew was clasped about his middle it was long and wound about him like a tail and it was made for scrooge observed it closely of cashboxes keys padlocks ledgers deeds and heavy purses wrought in steel his body was transparent so that scrooge observing him and looking through his waistcoat could see the two buttons on his coat behind ,A Christmas Carol
no nor did he believe it even now though he looked the phantom through and through and saw it standing before him though he felt the chilling influence of its deathcold eyes and marked the very texture of the folded kerchief bound about its head and chin which wrapper he had not observed before he was still incredulous and fought against his senses ,A Christmas Carol
who were you then said scrooge raising his voice youre particular for a shade he was going to say to a shade but substituted this as more appropriate ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge asked the question because he didnt know whether a ghost so transparent might find himself in a condition to take a chair and felt that in the event of its being impossible it might involve the necessity of an embarrassing explanation but the ghost sat down on the opposite side of the fireplace as if he were quite used to it ,A Christmas Carol
because said scrooge a little thing affects them a slight disorder of the stomach makes them cheats you may be an undigested bit of beef a blot of mustard a crumb of cheese a fragment of an underdone potato theres more of gravy than of grave about you whatever you are ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge was not much in the habit of cracking jokes nor did he feel in his heart by any means waggish then the truth is that he tried to be smart as a means of distracting his own attention and keeping down his terror for the spectres voice disturbed the very marrow in his bones ,A Christmas Carol
to sit staring at those fixed glazed eyes in silence for a moment would play scrooge felt the very deuce with him there was something very awful too in the spectres being provided with an infernal atmosphere of its own scrooge could not feel it himself but this was clearly the case for though the ghost sat perfectly motionless its hair and skirts and tassels were still agitated as by the hot vapour from an oven ,A Christmas Carol
you see this toothpick said scrooge returning quickly to the charge for the reason just assigned and wishing though it were only for a second to divert the visions stony gaze from himself ,A Christmas Carol
well returned scrooge i have but to swallow this and be for the rest of my days persecuted by a legion of goblins all of my own creation humbug i tell you humbug ,A Christmas Carol
at this the spirit raised a frightful cry and shook its chain with such a dismal and appalling noise that scrooge held on tight to his chair to save himself from falling in a swoon but how much greater was his horror when the phantom taking off the bandage round its head as if it were too warm to wear indoors its lower jaw dropped down upon its breast ,A Christmas Carol
it is required of every man the ghost returned that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his fellowmen and travel far and wide and if that spirit goes not forth in life it is condemned to do so after death it is doomed to wander through the worldoh woe is meand witness what it cannot share but might have shared on earth and turned to happiness ,A Christmas Carol
i wear the chain i forged in life replied the ghost i made it link by link and yard by yard i girded it on of my own free will and of my own free will i wore it is its pattern strange to you ,A Christmas Carol
or would you know pursued the ghost the weight and length of the strong coil you bear yourself it was full as heavy and as long as this seven christmas eves ago you have laboured on it since it is a ponderous chain ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge glanced about him on the floor in the expectation of finding himself surrounded by some fifty or sixty fathoms of iron cable but he could see nothing ,A Christmas Carol
i have none to give the ghost replied it comes from other regions ebenezer scrooge and is conveyed by other ministers to other kinds of men nor can i tell you what i would a very little more is all permitted to me i cannot rest i cannot stay i cannot linger anywhere my spirit never walked beyond our countinghousemark mein life my spirit never roved beyond the narrow limits of our moneychanging hole and weary journeys lie before me ,A Christmas Carol
it was a habit with scrooge whenever he became thoughtful to put his hands in his breeches pockets pondering on what the ghost had said he did so now but without lifting up his eyes or getting off his knees ,A Christmas Carol
the ghost on hearing this set up another cry and clanked its chain so hideously in the dead silence of the night that the ward would have been justified in indicting it for a nuisance ,A Christmas Carol
oh captive bound and doubleironed cried the phantom not to know that ages of incessant labour by immortal creatures for this earth must pass into eternity before the good of which it is susceptible is all developed not to know that any christian spirit working kindly in its little sphere whatever it may be will find its mortal life too short for its vast means of usefulness not to know that no space of regret can make amends for one lifes opportunity misused yet such was i oh such was i ,A Christmas Carol
business cried the ghost wringing its hands again mankind was my business the common welfare was my business charity mercy forbearance and benevolence were all my business the dealings of my trade were but a drop of water in the comprehensive ocean of my business ,A Christmas Carol
at this time of the rolling year the spectre said i suffer most why did i walk through crowds of fellowbeings with my eyes turned down and never raise them to that blessed star which led the wise men to a poor abode were there no poor homes to which its light would have conducted me ,A Christmas Carol
that is no light part of my penance pursued the ghost i am here tonight to warn you that you have yet a chance and hope of escaping my fate a chance and hope of my procuring ebenezer ,A Christmas Carol
expect the second on the next night at the same hour the third upon the next night when the last stroke of twelve has ceased to vibrate look to see me no more and look that for your own sake you remember what has passed between us ,A Christmas Carol
when it had said these words the spectre took its wrapper from the table and bound it round its head as before scrooge knew this by the smart sound its teeth made when the jaws were brought together by the bandage he ventured to raise his eyes again and found his supernatural visitor confronting him in an erect attitude with its chain wound over and about its arm ,A Christmas Carol
it beckoned scrooge to approach which he did when they were within two paces of each other marleys ghost held up its hand warning him to come no nearer scrooge stopped ,A Christmas Carol
not so much in obedience as in surprise and fear for on the raising of the hand he became sensible of confused noises in the air incoherent sounds of lamentation and regret wailings inexpressibly sorrowful and selfaccusatory the spectre after listening for a moment joined in the mournful dirge and floated out upon the bleak dark night ,A Christmas Carol
the air was filled with phantoms wandering hither and thither in restless haste and moaning as they went every one of them wore chains like marleys ghost some few they might be guilty governments were linked together none were free many had been personally known to scrooge in their lives he had been quite familiar with one old ghost in a white waistcoat with a monstrous iron safe attached to its ankle who cried piteously at being unable to assist a wretched woman with an infant whom it saw below upon a doorstep the misery with them all was clearly that they sought to interfere for good in human matters and had lost the power for ever ,A Christmas Carol
whether these creatures faded into mist or mist enshrouded them he could not tell but they and their spirit voices faded together and the night became as it had been when he walked home ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge closed the window and examined the door by which the ghost had entered it was doublelocked as he had locked it with his own hands and the bolts were undisturbed he tried to say humbug but stopped at the first syllable and being from the emotion he had undergone or the fatigues of the day or his glimpse of the invisible world or the dull conversation of the ghost or the lateness of the hour much in need of repose went straight to bed without undressing and fell asleep upon the instant ,A Christmas Carol
when scrooge awoke it was so dark that looking out of bed he could scarcely distinguish the transparent window from the opaque walls of his chamber he was endeavouring to pierce the darkness with his ferret eyes when the chimes of a neighbouring church struck the four quarters so he listened for the hour ,A Christmas Carol
to his great astonishment the heavy bell went on from six to seven and from seven to eight and regularly up to twelve then stopped twelve it was past two when he went to bed the clock was wrong an icicle must have got into the works twelve ,A Christmas Carol
why it isnt possible said scrooge that i can have slept through a whole day and far into another night it isnt possible that anything has happened to the sun and this is twelve at noon ,A Christmas Carol
the idea being an alarming one he scrambled out of bed and groped his way to the window he was obliged to rub the frost off with the sleeve of his dressinggown before he could see anything and could see very little then all he could make out was that it was still very foggy and extremely cold and that there was no noise of people running to and fro and making a great stir as there unquestionably would have been if night had beaten off bright day and taken possession of the world  this was a great relief because three days after sight of this first of exchange pay to mr ebenezer scrooge or his order and so forth would have become a mere united states security if there were no days to count by ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge went to bed again and thought and thought and thought it over and over and over and could make nothing of it  the more he thought the more perplexed he was and the more he endeavoured not to think the more he thought ,A Christmas Carol
marleys ghost bothered him exceedingly every time he resolved within himself after mature inquiry that it was all a dream his mind flew back again like a strong spring released to its first position and presented the same problem to be worked all through was it a dream or not ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge lay in this state until the chime had gone three quarters more when he remembered on a sudden that the ghost had warned him of a visitation when the bell tolled one  he resolved to lie awake until the hour was passed and considering that he could no more go to sleep than go to heaven this was perhaps the wisest resolution in his power ,A Christmas Carol
the curtains of his bed were drawn aside i tell you by a hand not the curtains at his feet nor the curtains at his back but those to which his face was addressed the curtains of his bed were drawn aside and scrooge starting up into a halfrecumbent attitude found himself face to face with the unearthly visitor who drew them as close to it as i am now to you and i am standing in the spirit at your elbow ,A Christmas Carol
it was a strange figurelike a child yet not so like a child as like an old man viewed through some supernatural medium which gave him the appearance of having receded from the view and being diminished to a childs proportions its hair which hung about its neck and down its back was white as if with age and yet the face had not a wrinkle in it and the tenderest bloom was on the skin the arms were very long and muscular the hands the same as if its hold were of uncommon strength its legs and feet most delicately formed were like those upper members bare it wore a tunic of the purest white and round its waist was bound a lustrous belt the sheen of which was beautiful it held a branch of fresh green holly in its hand and in singular contradiction of that wintry emblem had its dress trimmed with summer flowers but the strangest thing about it was that from the crown of its head there sprung a bright clear jet of light by which all this was visible and which was doubtless the occasion of its using in its duller moments a great extinguisher for a cap which it now held under its arm ,A Christmas Carol
even this though when scrooge looked at it with increasing steadiness was not its strangest quality for as its belt sparkled and glittered now in one part and now in another and what was light one instant at another time was dark so the figure itself fluctuated in its distinctness being now a thing with one arm now with one leg now with twenty legs now a pair of legs without a head now a head without a body of which dissolving parts no outline would be visible in the dense gloom wherein they melted away and in the very wonder of this it would be itself again distinct and clear as ever ,A Christmas Carol
what exclaimed the ghost would you so soon put out with worldly hands the light i give is it not enough that you are one of those whose passions made this cap and force me through whole trains of years to wear it low upon my brow ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge reverently disclaimed all intention to offend or any knowledge of having wilfully bonneted the spirit at any period of his life he then made bold to inquire what business brought him there ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge expressed himself much obliged but could not help thinking that a night of unbroken rest would have been more conducive to that end the spirit must have heard him thinking for it said immediately ,A Christmas Carol
it would have been in vain for scrooge to plead that the weather and the hour were not adapted to pedestrian purposes that bed was warm and the thermometer a long way below freezing that he was clad but lightly in his slippers dressinggown and nightcap and that he had a cold upon him at that time the grasp though gentle as a womans hand was not to be resisted he rose but finding that the spirit made towards the window clasped his robe in supplication ,A Christmas Carol
as the words were spoken they passed through the wall and stood upon an open country road with fields on either hand the city had entirely vanished not a vestige of it was to be seen the darkness and the mist had vanished with it for it was a clear cold winter day with snow upon the ground ,A Christmas Carol
the spirit gazed upon him mildly its gentle touch though it had been light and instantaneous appeared still present to the old mans sense of feeling he was conscious of a thousand odours floating in the air each one connected with a thousand thoughts and hopes and joys and cares long long forgotten ,A Christmas Carol
they walked along the road scrooge recognising every gate and post and tree until a little markettown appeared in the distance with its bridge its church and winding river some shaggy ponies now were seen trotting towards them with boys upon their backs who called to other boys in country gigs and carts driven by farmers all these boys were in great spirits and shouted to each other until the broad fields were so full of merry music that the crisp air laughed to hear it ,A Christmas Carol
the jocund travellers came on and as they came scrooge knew and named them every one why was he rejoiced beyond all bounds to see them why did his cold eye glisten and his heart leap up as they went past why was he filled with gladness when he heard them give each other merry christmas as they parted at crossroads and byeways for their several homes what was merry christmas to scrooge out upon merry christmas what good had it ever done to him ,A Christmas Carol
they left the highroad by a wellremembered lane and soon approached a mansion of dull red brick with a little weathercocksurmounted cupola on the roof and a bell hanging in it it was a large house but one of broken fortunes for the spacious offices were little used their walls were damp and mossy their windows broken and their gates decayed fowls clucked and strutted in the stables and the coachhouses and sheds were overrun with grass nor was it more retentive of its ancient state within for entering the dreary hall and glancing through the open doors of many rooms they found them poorly furnished cold and vast there was an earthy savour in the air a chilly bareness in the place which associated itself somehow with too much getting up by candlelight and not too much to eat ,A Christmas Carol
they went the ghost and scrooge across the hall to a door at the back of the house it opened before them and disclosed a long bare melancholy room made barer still by lines of plain deal forms and desks at one of these a lonely boy was reading near a feeble fire and scrooge sat down upon a form and wept to see his poor forgotten self as he used to be ,A Christmas Carol
not a latent echo in the house not a squeak and scuffle from the mice behind the panelling not a drip from the halfthawed waterspout in the dull yard behind not a sigh among the leafless boughs of one despondent poplar not the idle swinging of an empty storehouse door no not a clicking in the fire but fell upon the heart of scrooge with a softening influence and gave a freer passage to his tears ,A Christmas Carol
the spirit touched him on the arm and pointed to his younger self intent upon his reading suddenly a man in foreign garments wonderfully real and distinct to look at stood outside the window with an axe stuck in his belt and leading by the bridle an ass laden with wood ,A Christmas Carol
why its ali baba scrooge exclaimed in ecstasy its dear old honest ali baba yes yes i know one christmas time when yonder solitary child was left here all alone he did come for the first time just like that poor boy and valentine said scrooge and his wild brother orson there they go and whats his name who was put down in his drawers asleep at the gate of damascus dont you see him and the sultans groom turned upside down by the genii there he is upon his head serve him right im glad of it what business had he to be married to the princess ,A Christmas Carol
to hear scrooge expending all the earnestness of his nature on such subjects in a most extraordinary voice between laughing and crying and to see his heightened and excited face would have been a surprise to his business friends in the city indeed ,A Christmas Carol
theres the parrot cried scrooge green body and yellow tail with a thing like a lettuce growing out of the top of his head there he is poor robin crusoe he called him when he came home again after sailing round the island poor robin crusoe where have you been robin crusoe  the man thought he was dreaming but he wasnt it was the parrot you know there goes friday running for his life to the little creek halloa hoop halloo ,A Christmas Carol
scrooges former self grew larger at the words and the room became a little darker and more dirty the panels shrunk the windows cracked fragments of plaster fell out of the ceiling and the naked laths were shown instead but how all this was brought about scrooge knew no more than you do he only knew that it was quite correct that everything had happened so that there he was alone again when all the other boys had gone home for the jolly holidays ,A Christmas Carol
it opened and a little girl much younger than the boy came darting in and putting her arms about his neck and often kissing him addressed him as her dear dear brother ,A Christmas Carol
yes said the child brimful of glee home for good and all home for ever and ever father is so much kinder than he used to be that homes like heaven he spoke so gently to me one dear night when i was going to bed that i was not afraid to ask him once more if you might come home and he said yes you should and sent me in a coach to bring you and youre to be a man said the child opening her eyes and are never to come back here but first were to be together all the christmas long and have the merriest time in all the world ,A Christmas Carol
she clapped her hands and laughed and tried to touch his head but being too little laughed again and stood on tiptoe to embrace him then she began to drag him in her childish eagerness towards the door and he nothing loth to go accompanied her ,A Christmas Carol
a terrible voice in the hall cried bring down master scrooges box there and in the hall appeared the schoolmaster himself who glared on master scrooge with a ferocious condescension and threw him into a dreadful state of mind by shaking hands with him he then conveyed him and his sister into the veriest old well of a shivering bestparlour that ever was seen where the maps upon the wall and the celestial and terrestrial globes in the windows were waxy with cold here he produced a decanter of curiously light wine and a block of curiously heavy cake and administered instalments of those dainties to the young people at the same time sending out a meagre servant to offer a glass of something to the postboy who answered that he thanked the gentleman but if it was the same tap as he had tasted before he had rather not master scrooges trunk being by this time tied on to the top of the chaise the children bade the schoolmaster goodbye right willingly and getting into it drove gaily down the gardensweep the quick wheels dashing the hoarfrost and snow from off the dark leaves of the evergreens like spray ,A Christmas Carol
although they had but that moment left the school behind them they were now in the busy thoroughfares of a city where shadowy passengers passed and repassed where shadowy carts and coaches battled for the way and all the strife and tumult of a real city were it was made plain enough by the dressing of the shops that here too it was christmas time again but it was evening and the streets were lighted up ,A Christmas Carol
they went in at sight of an old gentleman in a welsh wig sitting behind such a high desk that if he had been two inches taller he must have knocked his head against the ceiling scrooge cried in great excitement ,A Christmas Carol
old fezziwig laid down his pen and looked up at the clock which pointed to the hour of seven he rubbed his hands adjusted his capacious waistcoat laughed all over himself from his shoes to his organ of benevolence and called out in a comfortable oily rich fat jovial voice ,A Christmas Carol
yo ho my boys said fezziwig no more work tonight christmas eve dick christmas ebenezer lets have the shutters up cried old fezziwig with a sharp clap of his hands before a man can say jack robinson ,A Christmas Carol
you wouldnt believe how those two fellows went at it they charged into the street with the shuttersone two threehad em up in their placesfour five sixbarred em and pinned emseven eight nineand came back before you could have got to twelve panting like racehorses ,A Christmas Carol
hilliho cried old fezziwig skipping down from the high desk with wonderful agility clear away my lads and lets have lots of room here hilliho dick chirrup ebenezer ,A Christmas Carol
clear away there was nothing they wouldnt have cleared away or couldnt have cleared away with old fezziwig looking on it was done in a minute every movable was packed off as if it were dismissed from public life for evermore the floor was swept and watered the lamps were trimmed fuel was heaped upon the fire and the warehouse was as snug and warm and dry and bright a ballroom as you would desire to see upon a winters night ,A Christmas Carol
in came a fiddler with a musicbook and went up to the lofty desk and made an orchestra of it and tuned like fifty stomachaches in came mrs fezziwig one vast substantial smile in came the three miss fezziwigs beaming and lovable in came the six young followers whose hearts they broke in came all the young men and women employed in the business in came the housemaid with her cousin the baker in came the cook with her brothers particular friend the milkman in came the boy from over the way who was suspected of not having board enough from his master trying to hide himself behind the girl from next door but one who was proved to have had her ears pulled by her mistress in they all came one after another some shyly some boldly some gracefully some awkwardly some pushing some pulling in they all came anyhow and everyhow away they all went twenty couple at once hands half round and back again the other way down the middle and up again round and round in various stages of affectionate grouping old top couple always turning up in the wrong place new top couple starting off again as soon as they got there all top couples at last and not a bottom one to help them when this result was brought about old fezziwig clapping his hands to stop the dance cried out well done and the fiddler plunged his hot face into a pot of porter especially provided for that purpose but scorning rest upon his reappearance he instantly began again though there were no dancers yet as if the other fiddler had been carried home exhausted on a shutter and he were a brannew man resolved to beat him out of sight or perish ,A Christmas Carol
there were more dances and there were forfeits and more dances and there was cake and there was negus and there was a great piece of cold roast and there was a great piece of cold boiled and there were mincepies and plenty of beer but the great effect of the evening came after the roast and boiled when the fiddler an artful dog mind the sort of man who knew his business better than you or i could have told it him struck up sir roger de coverley  then old fezziwig stood out to dance with mrs fezziwig top couple too with a good stiff piece of work cut out for them three or four and twenty pair of partners people who were not to be trifled with people who would dance and had no notion of walking ,A Christmas Carol
but if they had been twice as manyah four timesold fezziwig would have been a match for them and so would mrs fezziwig as to her she was worthy to be his partner in every sense of the term if thats not high praise tell me higher and ill use it a positive light appeared to issue from fezziwigs calves they shone in every part of the dance like moons you couldnt have predicted at any given time what would have become of them next and when old fezziwig and mrs fezziwig had gone all through the dance advance and retire both hands to your partner bow and curtsey corkscrew threadtheneedle and back again to your place fezziwig cutcut so deftly that he appeared to wink with his legs and came upon his feet again without a stagger ,A Christmas Carol
when the clock struck eleven this domestic ball broke up mr and mrs fezziwig took their stations one on either side of the door and shaking hands with every person individually as he or she went out wished him or her a merry christmas when everybody had retired but the two prentices they did the same to them and thus the cheerful voices died away and the lads were left to their beds which were under a counter in the backshop ,A Christmas Carol
during the whole of this time scrooge had acted like a man out of his wits his heart and soul were in the scene and with his former self he corroborated everything remembered everything enjoyed everything and underwent the strangest agitation it was not until now when the bright faces of his former self and dick were turned from them that he remembered the ghost and became conscious that it was looking full upon him while the light upon its head burnt very clear ,A Christmas Carol
it isnt that said scrooge heated by the remark and speaking unconsciously like his former not his latter self it isnt that spirit he has the power to render us happy or unhappy to make our service light or burdensome a pleasure or a toil say that his power lies in words and looks in things so slight and insignificant that it is impossible to add and count em up what then the happiness he gives is quite as great as if it cost a fortune ,A Christmas Carol
this was not addressed to scrooge or to any one whom he could see but it produced an immediate effect for again scrooge saw himself he was older now a man in the prime of life his face had not the harsh and rigid lines of later years but it had begun to wear the signs of care and avarice there was an eager greedy restless motion in the eye which showed the passion that had taken root and where the shadow of the growing tree would fall ,A Christmas Carol
he was not alone but sat by the side of a fair young girl in a mourningdress in whose eyes there were tears which sparkled in the light that shone out of the ghost of christmas past ,A Christmas Carol
it matters little she said softly to you very little another idol has displaced me and if it can cheer and comfort you in time to come as i would have tried to do i have no just cause to grieve ,A Christmas Carol
this is the evenhanded dealing of the world he said there is nothing on which it is so hard as poverty and there is nothing it professes to condemn with such severity as the pursuit of wealth ,A Christmas Carol
you fear the world too much she answered gently all your other hopes have merged into the hope of being beyond the chance of its sordid reproach i have seen your nobler aspirations fall off one by one until the masterpassion gain engrosses you have i not ,A Christmas Carol
our contract is an old one it was made when we were both poor and content to be so until in good season we could improve our worldly fortune by our patient industry you are changed when it was made you were another man ,A Christmas Carol
your own feeling tells you that you were not what you are she returned i am that which promised happiness when we were one in heart is fraught with misery now that we are two how often and how keenly i have thought of this i will not say it is enough that i have thought of it and can release you ,A Christmas Carol
in a changed nature in an altered spirit in another atmosphere of life another hope as its great end in everything that made my love of any worth or value in your sight if this had never been between us said the girl looking mildly but with steadiness upon him tell me would you seek me out and try to win me now ah no ,A Christmas Carol
i would gladly think otherwise if i could she answered heaven knows when i have learned a truth like this i know how strong and irresistible it must be but if you were free today tomorrow yesterday can even i believe that you would choose a dowerless girlyou who in your very confidence with her weigh everything by gain or choosing her if for a moment you were false enough to your one guiding principle to do so do i not know that your repentance and regret would surely follow i do and i release you with a full heart for the love of him you once were ,A Christmas Carol
you maythe memory of what is past half makes me hope you willhave pain in this a very very brief time and you will dismiss the recollection of it gladly as an unprofitable dream from which it happened well that you awoke may you be happy in the life you have chosen ,A Christmas Carol
they were in another scene and place a room not very large or handsome but full of comfort near to the winter fire sat a beautiful young girl so like that last that scrooge believed it was the same until he saw her now a comely matron sitting opposite her daughter the noise in this room was perfectly tumultuous for there were more children there than scrooge in his agitated state of mind could count and unlike the celebrated herd in the poem they were not forty children conducting themselves like one but every child was conducting itself like forty the consequences were uproarious beyond belief but no one seemed to care on the contrary the mother and daughter laughed heartily and enjoyed it very much and the latter soon beginning to mingle in the sports got pillaged by the young brigands most ruthlessly what would i not have given to be one of them though i never could have been so rude no no i wouldnt for the wealth of all the world have crushed that braided hair and torn it down and for the precious little shoe i wouldnt have plucked it off god bless my soul to save my life as to measuring her waist in sport as they did bold young brood i couldnt have done it i should have expected my arm to have grown round it for a punishment and never come straight again and yet i should have dearly liked i own to have touched her lips to have questioned her that she might have opened them to have looked upon the lashes of her downcast eyes and never raised a blush to have let loose waves of hair an inch of which would be a keepsake beyond price in short i should have liked i do confess to have had the lightest licence of a child and yet to have been man enough to know its value ,A Christmas Carol
but now a knocking at the door was heard and such a rush immediately ensued that she with laughing face and plundered dress was borne towards it the centre of a flushed and boisterous group just in time to greet the father who came home attended by a man laden with christmas toys and presents then the shouting and the struggling and the onslaught that was made on the defenceless porter the scaling him with chairs for ladders to dive into his pockets despoil him of brownpaper parcels hold on tight by his cravat hug him round his neck pommel his back and kick his legs in irrepressible affection the shouts of wonder and delight with which the development of every package was received the terrible announcement that the baby had been taken in the act of putting a dolls fryingpan into his mouth and was more than suspected of having swallowed a fictitious turkey glued on a wooden platter the immense relief of finding this a false alarm the joy and gratitude and ecstasy they are all indescribable alike it is enough that by degrees the children and their emotions got out of the parlour and by one stair at a time up to the top of the house where they went to bed and so subsided ,A Christmas Carol
and now scrooge looked on more attentively than ever when the master of the house having his daughter leaning fondly on him sat down with her and her mother at his own fireside and when he thought that such another creature quite as graceful and as full of promise might have called him father and been a springtime in the haggard winter of his life his sight grew very dim indeed ,A Christmas Carol
mr scrooge it was i passed his office window and as it was not shut up and he had a candle inside i could scarcely help seeing him his partner lies upon the point of death i hear and there he sat alone quite alone in the world i do believe ,A Christmas Carol
in the struggle if that can be called a struggle in which the ghost with no visible resistance on its own part was undisturbed by any effort of its adversary scrooge observed that its light was burning high and bright and dimly connecting that with its influence over him he seized the extinguishercap and by a sudden action pressed it down upon its head ,A Christmas Carol
the spirit dropped beneath it so that the extinguisher covered its whole form but though scrooge pressed it down with all his force he could not hide the light which streamed from under it in an unbroken flood upon the ground ,A Christmas Carol
he was conscious of being exhausted and overcome by an irresistible drowsiness and further of being in his own bedroom  he gave the cap a parting squeeze in which his hand relaxed and had barely time to reel to bed before he sank into a heavy sleep ,A Christmas Carol
awaking in the middle of a prodigiously tough snore and sitting up in bed to get his thoughts together scrooge had no occasion to be told that the bell was again upon the stroke of one he felt that he was restored to consciousness in the right nick of time for the especial purpose of holding a conference with the second messenger despatched to him through jacob marleys intervention but finding that he turned uncomfortably cold when he began to wonder which of his curtains this new spectre would draw back he put them every one aside with his own hands and lying down again established a sharp lookout all round the bed for he wished to challenge the spirit on the moment of its appearance and did not wish to be taken by surprise and made nervous ,A Christmas Carol
gentlemen of the freeandeasy sort who plume themselves on being acquainted with a move or two and being usually equal to the timeofday express the wide range of their capacity for adventure by observing that they are good for anything from pitchandtoss to manslaughter between which opposite extremes no doubt there lies a tolerably wide and comprehensive range of subjects without venturing for scrooge quite as hardily as this i dont mind calling on you to believe that he was ready for a good broad field of strange appearances and that nothing between a baby and rhinoceros would have astonished him very much ,A Christmas Carol
now being prepared for almost anything he was not by any means prepared for nothing and consequently when the bell struck one and no shape appeared he was taken with a violent fit of trembling five minutes ten minutes a quarter of an hour went by yet nothing came all this time he lay upon his bed the very core and centre of a blaze of ruddy light which streamed upon it when the clock proclaimed the hour and which being only light was more alarming than a dozen ghosts as he was powerless to make out what it meant or would be at and was sometimes apprehensive that he might be at that very moment an interesting case of spontaneous combustion without having the consolation of knowing it at last however he began to thinkas you or i would have thought at first for it is always the person not in the predicament who knows what ought to have been done in it and would unquestionably have done it tooat last i say he began to think that the source and secret of this ghostly light might be in the adjoining room from whence on further tracing it it seemed to shine this idea taking full possession of his mind he got up softly and shuffled in his slippers to the door ,A Christmas Carol
it was his own room there was no doubt about that but it had undergone a surprising transformation the walls and ceiling were so hung with living green that it looked a perfect grove from every part of which bright gleaming berries glistened the crisp leaves of holly mistletoe and ivy reflected back the light as if so many little mirrors had been scattered there and such a mighty blaze went roaring up the chimney as that dull petrification of a hearth had never known in scrooges time or marleys or for many and many a winter season gone heaped up on the floor to form a kind of throne were turkeys geese game poultry brawn great joints of meat suckingpigs long wreaths of sausages mincepies plumpuddings barrels of oysters redhot chestnuts cherrycheeked apples juicy oranges luscious pears immense twelfthcakes and seething bowls of punch that made the chamber dim with their delicious steam in easy state upon this couch there sat a jolly giant glorious to see who bore a glowing torch in shape not unlike plentys horn and held it up high up to shed its light on scrooge as he came peeping round the door ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge entered timidly and hung his head before this spirit he was not the dogged scrooge he had been and though the spirits eyes were clear and kind he did not like to meet them ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge reverently did so it was clothed in one simple green robe or mantle bordered with white fur this garment hung so loosely on the figure that its capacious breast was bare as if disdaining to be warded or concealed by any artifice its feet observable beneath the ample folds of the garment were also bare and on its head it wore no other covering than a holly wreath set here and there with shining icicles its dark brown curls were long and free free as its genial face its sparkling eye its open hand its cheery voice its unconstrained demeanour and its joyful air girded round its middle was an antique scabbard but no sword was in it and the ancient sheath was eaten up with rust ,A Christmas Carol
spirit said scrooge submissively conduct me where you will i went forth last night on compulsion and i learnt a lesson which is working now tonight if you have aught to teach me let me profit by it ,A Christmas Carol
holly mistletoe red berries ivy turkeys geese game poultry brawn meat pigs sausages oysters pies puddings fruit and punch all vanished instantly so did the room the fire the ruddy glow the hour of night and they stood in the city streets on christmas morning where for the weather was severe the people made a rough but brisk and not unpleasant kind of music in scraping the snow from the pavement in front of their dwellings and from the tops of their houses whence it was mad delight to the boys to see it come plumping down into the road below and splitting into artificial little snowstorms ,A Christmas Carol
the house fronts looked black enough and the windows blacker contrasting with the smooth white sheet of snow upon the roofs and with the dirtier snow upon the ground which last deposit had been ploughed up in deep furrows by the heavy wheels of carts and waggons furrows that crossed and recrossed each other hundreds of times where the great streets branched off and made intricate channels hard to trace in the thick yellow mud and icy water the sky was gloomy and the shortest streets were choked up with a dingy mist half thawed half frozen whose heavier particles descended in a shower of sooty atoms as if all the chimneys in great britain had by one consent caught fire and were blazing away to their dear hearts content there was nothing very cheerful in the climate or the town and yet was there an air of cheerfulness abroad that the clearest summer air and brightest summer sun might have endeavoured to diffuse in vain ,A Christmas Carol
for the people who were shovelling away on the housetops were jovial and full of glee calling out to one another from the parapets and now and then exchanging a facetious snowballbetternatured missile far than many a wordy jest laughing heartily if it went right and not less heartily if it went wrong the poulterers shops were still half open and the fruiterers were radiant in their glory there were great round potbellied baskets of chestnuts shaped like the waistcoats of jolly old gentlemen lolling at the doors and tumbling out into the street in their apoplectic opulence there were ruddy brownfaced broadgirthed spanish onions shining in the fatness of their growth like spanish friars and winking from their shelves in wanton slyness at the girls as they went by and glanced demurely at the hungup mistletoe there were pears and apples clustered high in blooming pyramids there were bunches of grapes made in the shopkeepers benevolence to dangle from conspicuous hooks that peoples mouths might water gratis as they passed there were piles of filberts mossy and brown recalling in their fragrance ancient walks among the woods and pleasant shufflings ankle deep through withered leaves there were norfolk biffins squat and swarthy setting off the yellow of the oranges and lemons and in the great compactness of their juicy persons urgently entreating and beseeching to be carried home in paper bags and eaten after dinner the very gold and silver fish set forth among these choice fruits in a bowl though members of a dull and stagnantblooded race appeared to know that there was something going on and to a fish went gasping round and round their little world in slow and passionless excitement ,A Christmas Carol
the grocers oh the grocers nearly closed with perhaps two shutters down or one but through those gaps such glimpses it was not alone that the scales descending on the counter made a merry sound or that the twine and roller parted company so briskly or that the canisters were rattled up and down like juggling tricks or even that the blended scents of tea and coffee were so grateful to the nose or even that the raisins were so plentiful and rare the almonds so extremely white the sticks of cinnamon so long and straight the other spices so delicious the candied fruits so caked and spotted with molten sugar as to make the coldest lookerson feel faint and subsequently bilious nor was it that the figs were moist and pulpy or that the french plums blushed in modest tartness from their highlydecorated boxes or that everything was good to eat and in its christmas dress but the customers were all so hurried and so eager in the hopeful promise of the day that they tumbled up against each other at the door crashing their wicker baskets wildly and left their purchases upon the counter and came running back to fetch them and committed hundreds of the like mistakes in the best humour possible while the grocer and his people were so frank and fresh that the polished hearts with which they fastened their aprons behind might have been their own worn outside for general inspection and for christmas daws to peck at if they chose ,A Christmas Carol
but soon the steeples called good people all to church and chapel and away they came flocking through the streets in their best clothes and with their gayest faces and at the same time there emerged from scores of byestreets lanes and nameless turnings innumerable people carrying their dinners to the bakers shops the sight of these poor revellers appeared to interest the spirit very much for he stood with scrooge beside him in a bakers doorway and taking off the covers as their bearers passed sprinkled incense on their dinners from his torch and it was a very uncommon kind of torch for once or twice when there were angry words between some dinnercarriers who had jostled each other he shed a few drops of water on them from it and their good humour was restored directly for they said it was a shame to quarrel upon christmas day and so it was god love it so it was ,A Christmas Carol
in time the bells ceased and the bakers were shut up and yet there was a genial shadowing forth of all these dinners and the progress of their cooking in the thawed blotch of wet above each bakers oven where the pavement smoked as if its stones were cooking too ,A Christmas Carol
spirit said scrooge after a moments thought i wonder you of all the beings in the many worlds about us should desire to cramp these peoples opportunities of innocent enjoyment ,A Christmas Carol
there are some upon this earth of yours returned the spirit who lay claim to know us and who do their deeds of passion pride illwill hatred envy bigotry and selfishness in our name who are as strange to us and all our kith and kin as if they had never lived remember that and charge their doings on themselves not us ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge promised that he would and they went on invisible as they had been before into the suburbs of the town it was a remarkable quality of the ghost which scrooge had observed at the bakers that notwithstanding his gigantic size he could accommodate himself to any place with ease and that he stood beneath a low roof quite as gracefully and like a supernatural creature as it was possible he could have done in any lofty hall ,A Christmas Carol
and perhaps it was the pleasure the good spirit had in showing off this power of his or else it was his own kind generous hearty nature and his sympathy with all poor men that led him straight to scrooges clerks for there he went and took scrooge with him holding to his robe and on the threshold of the door the spirit smiled and stopped to bless bob cratchits dwelling with the sprinkling of his torch think of that bob had but fifteen bob aweek himself he pocketed on saturdays but fifteen copies of his christian name and yet the ghost of christmas present blessed his fourroomed house ,A Christmas Carol
then up rose mrs cratchit cratchits wife dressed out but poorly in a twiceturned gown but brave in ribbons which are cheap and make a goodly show for sixpence and she laid the cloth assisted by belinda cratchit second of her daughters also brave in ribbons while master peter cratchit plunged a fork into the saucepan of potatoes and getting the corners of his monstrous shirt collar bobs private property conferred upon his son and heir in honour of the day into his mouth rejoiced to find himself so gallantly attired and yearned to show his linen in the fashionable parks and now two smaller cratchits boy and girl came tearing in screaming that outside the bakers they had smelt the goose and known it for their own and basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onion these young cratchits danced about the table and exalted master peter cratchit to the skies while he not proud although his collars nearly choked him blew the fire until the slow potatoes bubbling up knocked loudly at the saucepanlid to be let out and peeled ,A Christmas Carol
so martha hid herself and in came little bob the father with at least three feet of comforter exclusive of the fringe hanging down before him and his threadbare clothes darned up and brushed to look seasonable and tiny tim upon his shoulder alas for tiny tim he bore a little crutch and had his limbs supported by an iron frame ,A Christmas Carol
not coming said bob with a sudden declension in his high spirits for he had been tims blood horse all the way from church and had come home rampant not coming upon christmas day ,A Christmas Carol
martha didnt like to see him disappointed if it were only in joke so she came out prematurely from behind the closet door and ran into his arms while the two young cratchits hustled tiny tim and bore him off into the washhouse that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper ,A Christmas Carol
as good as gold said bob and better somehow he gets thoughtful sitting by himself so much and thinks the strangest things you ever heard he told me coming home that he hoped the people saw him in the church because he was a cripple and it might be pleasant to them to remember upon christmas day who made lame beggars walk and blind men see ,A Christmas Carol
his active little crutch was heard upon the floor and back came tiny tim before another word was spoken escorted by his brother and sister to his stool before the fire and while bob turning up his cuffsas if poor fellow they were capable of being made more shabbycompounded some hot mixture in a jug with gin and lemons and stirred it round and round and put it on the hob to simmer master peter and the two ubiquitous young cratchits went to fetch the goose with which they soon returned in high procession ,A Christmas Carol
such a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of all birds a feathered phenomenon to which a black swan was a matter of courseand in truth it was something very like it in that house mrs cratchit made the gravy ready beforehand in a little saucepan hissing hot master peter mashed the potatoes with incredible vigour miss belinda sweetened up the applesauce martha dusted the hot plates bob took tiny tim beside him in a tiny corner at the table the two young cratchits set chairs for everybody not forgetting themselves and mounting guard upon their posts crammed spoons into their mouths lest they should shriek for goose before their turn came to be helped at last the dishes were set on and grace was said it was succeeded by a breathless pause as mrs cratchit looking slowly all along the carvingknife prepared to plunge it in the breast but when she did and when the long expected gush of stuffing issued forth one murmur of delight arose all round the board and even tiny tim excited by the two young cratchits beat on the table with the handle of his knife and feebly cried hurrah ,A Christmas Carol
there never was such a goose bob said he didnt believe there ever was such a goose cooked its tenderness and flavour size and cheapness were the themes of universal admiration eked out by applesauce and mashed potatoes it was a sufficient dinner for the whole family indeed as mrs cratchit said with great delight surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish they hadnt ate it all at last yet every one had had enough and the youngest cratchits in particular were steeped in sage and onion to the eyebrows but now the plates being changed by miss belinda mrs cratchit left the room alonetoo nervous to bear witnessesto take the pudding up and bring it in ,A Christmas Carol
suppose it should not be done enough suppose it should break in turning out suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the backyard and stolen it while they were merry with the goosea supposition at which the two young cratchits became livid all sorts of horrors were supposed ,A Christmas Carol
hallo a great deal of steam the pudding was out of the copper a smell like a washingday that was the cloth a smell like an eatinghouse and a pastrycooks next door to each other with a laundresss next door to that that was the pudding in half a minute mrs cratchit enteredflushed but smiling proudlywith the pudding like a speckled cannonball so hard and firm blazing in half of halfaquartern of ignited brandy and bedight with christmas holly stuck into the top ,A Christmas Carol
oh a wonderful pudding bob cratchit said and calmly too that he regarded it as the greatest success achieved by mrs cratchit since their marriage mrs cratchit said that now the weight was off her mind she would confess she had had her doubts about the quantity of flour everybody had something to say about it but nobody said or thought it was at all a small pudding for a large family it would have been flat heresy to do so any cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a thing ,A Christmas Carol
at last the dinner was all done the cloth was cleared the hearth swept and the fire made up the compound in the jug being tasted and considered perfect apples and oranges were put upon the table and a shovelfull of chestnuts on the fire then all the cratchit family drew round the hearth in what bob cratchit called a circle meaning half a one and at bob cratchits elbow stood the family display of glass two tumblers and a custardcup without a handle ,A Christmas Carol
these held the hot stuff from the jug however as well as golden goblets would have done and bob served it out with beaming looks while the chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily then bob proposed ,A Christmas Carol
he sat very close to his fathers side upon his little stool bob held his withered little hand in his as if he loved the child and wished to keep him by his side and dreaded that he might be taken from him ,A Christmas Carol
i see a vacant seat replied the ghost in the poor chimneycorner and a crutch without an owner carefully preserved if these shadows remain unaltered by the future the child will die ,A Christmas Carol
if these shadows remain unaltered by the future none other of my race returned the ghost will find him here what then if he be like to die he had better do it and decrease the surplus population ,A Christmas Carol
man said the ghost if man you be in heart not adamant forbear that wicked cant until you have discovered what the surplus is and where it is will you decide what men shall live what men shall die it may be that in the sight of heaven you are more worthless and less fit to live than millions like this poor mans child oh god to hear the insect on the leaf pronouncing on the too much life among his hungry brothers in the dust ,A Christmas Carol
the founder of the feast indeed cried mrs cratchit reddening i wish i had him here id give him a piece of my mind to feast upon and i hope hed have a good appetite for it ,A Christmas Carol
it should be christmas day i am sure said she on which one drinks the health of such an odious stingy hard unfeeling man as mr scrooge you know he is robert nobody knows it better than you do poor fellow ,A Christmas Carol
ill drink his health for your sake and the days said mrs cratchit not for his long life to him a merry christmas and a happy new year hell be very merry and very happy i have no doubt ,A Christmas Carol
the children drank the toast after her it was the first of their proceedings which had no heartiness tiny tim drank it last of all but he didnt care twopence for it scrooge was the ogre of the family the mention of his name cast a dark shadow on the party which was not dispelled for full five minutes ,A Christmas Carol
after it had passed away they were ten times merrier than before from the mere relief of scrooge the baleful being done with bob cratchit told them how he had a situation in his eye for master peter which would bring in if obtained full fiveandsixpence weekly the two young cratchits laughed tremendously at the idea of peters being a man of business and peter himself looked thoughtfully at the fire from between his collars as if he were deliberating what particular investments he should favour when he came into the receipt of that bewildering income martha who was a poor apprentice at a milliners then told them what kind of work she had to do and how many hours she worked at a stretch and how she meant to lie abed tomorrow morning for a good long rest tomorrow being a holiday she passed at home also how she had seen a countess and a lord some days before and how the lord was much about as tall as peter at which peter pulled up his collars so high that you couldnt have seen his head if you had been there all this time the chestnuts and the jug went round and round and byandbye they had a song about a lost child travelling in the snow from tiny tim who had a plaintive little voice and sang it very well indeed ,A Christmas Carol
there was nothing of high mark in this they were not a handsome family they were not well dressed their shoes were far from being waterproof their clothes were scanty and peter might have known and very likely did the inside of a pawnbrokers but they were happy grateful pleased with one another and contented with the time and when they faded and looked happier yet in the bright sprinklings of the spirits torch at parting scrooge had his eye upon them and especially on tiny tim until the last ,A Christmas Carol
by this time it was getting dark and snowing pretty heavily and as scrooge and the spirit went along the streets the brightness of the roaring fires in kitchens parlours and all sorts of rooms was wonderful here the flickering of the blaze showed preparations for a cosy dinner with hot plates baking through and through before the fire and deep red curtains ready to be drawn to shut out cold and darkness there all the children of the house were running out into the snow to meet their married sisters brothers cousins uncles aunts and be the first to greet them here again were shadows on the windowblind of guests assembling and there a group of handsome girls all hooded and furbooted and all chattering at once tripped lightly off to some near neighbours house where woe upon the single man who saw them enterartful witches well they knew itin a glow ,A Christmas Carol
but if you had judged from the numbers of people on their way to friendly gatherings you might have thought that no one was at home to give them welcome when they got there instead of every house expecting company and piling up its fires halfchimney high blessings on it how the ghost exulted how it bared its breadth of breast and opened its capacious palm and floated on outpouring with a generous hand its bright and harmless mirth on everything within its reach the very lamplighter who ran on before dotting the dusky street with specks of light and who was dressed to spend the evening somewhere laughed out loudly as the spirit passed though little kenned the lamplighter that he had any company but christmas ,A Christmas Carol
and now without a word of warning from the ghost they stood upon a bleak and desert moor where monstrous masses of rude stone were cast about as though it were the burialplace of giants and water spread itself wheresoever it listed or would have done so but for the frost that held it prisoner and nothing grew but moss and furze and coarse rank grass down in the west the setting sun had left a streak of fiery red which glared upon the desolation for an instant like a sullen eye and frowning lower lower lower yet was lost in the thick gloom of darkest night ,A Christmas Carol
a light shone from the window of a hut and swiftly they advanced towards it passing through the wall of mud and stone they found a cheerful company assembled round a glowing fire an old old man and woman with their children and their childrens children and another generation beyond that all decked out gaily in their holiday attire the old man in a voice that seldom rose above the howling of the wind upon the barren waste was singing them a christmas songit had been a very old song when he was a boyand from time to time they all joined in the chorus so surely as they raised their voices the old man got quite blithe and loud and so surely as they stopped his vigour sank again ,A Christmas Carol
the spirit did not tarry here but bade scrooge hold his robe and passing on above the moor spedwhither not to sea to sea to scrooges horror looking back he saw the last of the land a frightful range of rocks behind them and his ears were deafened by the thundering of water as it rolled and roared and raged among the dreadful caverns it had worn and fiercely tried to undermine the earth ,A Christmas Carol
built upon a dismal reef of sunken rocks some league or so from shore on which the waters chafed and dashed the wild year through there stood a solitary lighthouse great heaps of seaweed clung to its base and stormbirds born of the wind one might suppose as seaweed of the waterrose and fell about it like the waves they skimmed ,A Christmas Carol
but even here two men who watched the light had made a fire that through the loophole in the thick stone wall shed out a ray of brightness on the awful sea joining their horny hands over the rough table at which they sat they wished each other merry christmas in their can of grog and one of them the elder too with his face all damaged and scarred with hard weather as the figurehead of an old ship might be struck up a sturdy song that was like a gale in itself ,A Christmas Carol
again the ghost sped on above the black and heaving sea on onuntil being far away as he told scrooge from any shore they lighted on a ship they stood beside the helmsman at the wheel the lookout in the bow the officers who had the watch dark ghostly figures in their several stations but every man among them hummed a christmas tune or had a christmas thought or spoke below his breath to his companion of some bygone christmas day with homeward hopes belonging to it and every man on board waking or sleeping good or bad had had a kinder word for another on that day than on any day in the year and had shared to some extent in its festivities and had remembered those he cared for at a distance and had known that they delighted to remember him ,A Christmas Carol
it was a great surprise to scrooge while listening to the moaning of the wind and thinking what a solemn thing it was to move on through the lonely darkness over an unknown abyss whose depths were secrets as profound as death it was a great surprise to scrooge while thus engaged to hear a hearty laugh it was a much greater surprise to scrooge to recognise it as his own nephews and to find himself in a bright dry gleaming room with the spirit standing smiling by his side and looking at that same nephew with approving affability ,A Christmas Carol
if you should happen by any unlikely chance to know a man more blest in a laugh than scrooges nephew all i can say is i should like to know him too introduce him to me and ill cultivate his acquaintance ,A Christmas Carol
it is a fair evenhanded noble adjustment of things that while there is infection in disease and sorrow there is nothing in the world so irresistibly contagious as laughter and goodhumour when scrooges nephew laughed in this way holding his sides rolling his head and twisting his face into the most extravagant contortions scrooges niece by marriage laughed as heartily as he and their assembled friends being not a bit behindhand roared out lustily ,A Christmas Carol
she was very pretty exceedingly pretty with a dimpled surprisedlooking capital face a ripe little mouth that seemed made to be kissedas no doubt it was all kinds of good little dots about her chin that melted into one another when she laughed and the sunniest pair of eyes you ever saw in any little creatures head altogether she was what you would have called provoking you know but satisfactory too oh perfectly satisfactory ,A Christmas Carol
hes a comical old fellow said scrooges nephew thats the truth and not so pleasant as he might be however his offences carry their own punishment and i have nothing to say against him ,A Christmas Carol
what of that my dear said scrooges nephew his wealth is of no use to him he dont do any good with it he dont make himself comfortable with it he hasnt the satisfaction of thinkingha ha hathat he is ever going to benefit us with it ,A Christmas Carol
oh i have said scrooges nephew i am sorry for him i couldnt be angry with him if i tried who suffers by his ill whims himself always here he takes it into his head to dislike us and he wont come and dine with us whats the consequence he dont lose much of a dinner ,A Christmas Carol
indeed i think he loses a very good dinner interrupted scrooges niece everybody else said the same and they must be allowed to have been competent judges because they had just had dinner and with the dessert upon the table were clustered round the fire by lamplight ,A Christmas Carol
topper had clearly got his eye upon one of scrooges nieces sisters for he answered that a bachelor was a wretched outcast who had no right to express an opinion on the subject whereat scrooges nieces sisterthe plump one with the lace tucker not the one with the rosesblushed ,A Christmas Carol
scrooges nephew revelled in another laugh and as it was impossible to keep the infection off though the plump sister tried hard to do it with aromatic vinegar his example was unanimously followed ,A Christmas Carol
i was only going to say said scrooges nephew that the consequence of his taking a dislike to us and not making merry with us is as i think that he loses some pleasant moments which could do him no harm i am sure he loses pleasanter companions than he can find in his own thoughts either in his mouldy old office or his dusty chambers i mean to give him the same chance every year whether he likes it or not for i pity him he may rail at christmas till he dies but he cant help thinking better of iti defy himif he finds me going there in good temper year after year and saying uncle scrooge how are you if it only puts him in the vein to leave his poor clerk fifty pounds thats something and i think i shook him yesterday ,A Christmas Carol
it was their turn to laugh now at the notion of his shaking scrooge but being thoroughly goodnatured and not much caring what they laughed at so that they laughed at any rate he encouraged them in their merriment and passed the bottle joyously ,A Christmas Carol
after tea they had some music for they were a musical family and knew what they were about when they sung a glee or catch i can assure you especially topper who could growl away in the bass like a good one and never swell the large veins in his forehead or get red in the face over it scrooges niece played well upon the harp and played among other tunes a simple little air a mere nothing you might learn to whistle it in two minutes which had been familiar to the child who fetched scrooge from the boardingschool as he had been reminded by the ghost of christmas past when this strain of music sounded all the things that ghost had shown him came upon his mind he softened more and more and thought that if he could have listened to it often years ago he might have cultivated the kindnesses of life for his own happiness with his own hands without resorting to the sextons spade that buried jacob marley ,A Christmas Carol
but they didnt devote the whole evening to music after a while they played at forfeits for it is good to be children sometimes and never better than at christmas when its mighty founder was a child himself stop there was first a game at blindmans buff of course there was and i no more believe topper was really blind than i believe he had eyes in his boots my opinion is that it was a done thing between him and scrooges nephew and that the ghost of christmas present knew it the way he went after that plump sister in the lace tucker was an outrage on the credulity of human nature knocking down the fireirons tumbling over the chairs bumping against the piano smothering himself among the curtains wherever she went there went he he always knew where the plump sister was he wouldnt catch anybody else if you had fallen up against him as some of them did on purpose he would have made a feint of endeavouring to seize you which would have been an affront to your understanding and would instantly have sidled off in the direction of the plump sister she often cried out that it wasnt fair and it really was not but when at last he caught her when in spite of all her silken rustlings and her rapid flutterings past him he got her into a corner whence there was no escape then his conduct was the most execrable for his pretending not to know her his pretending that it was necessary to touch her headdress and further to assure himself of her identity by pressing a certain ring upon her finger and a certain chain about her neck was vile monstrous no doubt she told him her opinion of it when another blindman being in office they were so very confidential together behind the curtains ,A Christmas Carol
scrooges niece was not one of the blindmans buff party but was made comfortable with a large chair and a footstool in a snug corner where the ghost and scrooge were close behind her but she joined in the forfeits and loved her love to admiration with all the letters of the alphabet likewise at the game of how when and where she was very great and to the secret joy of scrooges nephew beat her sisters hollow though they were sharp girls too as topper could have told you there might have been twenty people there young and old but they all played and so did scrooge for wholly forgetting in the interest he had in what was going on that his voice made no sound in their ears he sometimes came out with his guess quite loud and very often guessed quite right too for the sharpest needle best whitechapel warranted not to cut in the eye was not sharper than scrooge blunt as he took it in his head to be ,A Christmas Carol
the ghost was greatly pleased to find him in this mood and looked upon him with such favour that he begged like a boy to be allowed to stay until the guests departed but this the spirit said could not be done ,A Christmas Carol
it was a game called yes and no where scrooges nephew had to think of something and the rest must find out what he only answering to their questions yes or no as the case was the brisk fire of questioning to which he was exposed elicited from him that he was thinking of an animal a live animal rather a disagreeable animal a savage animal an animal that growled and grunted sometimes and talked sometimes and lived in london and walked about the streets and wasnt made a show of and wasnt led by anybody and didnt live in a menagerie and was never killed in a market and was not a horse or an ass or a cow or a bull or a tiger or a dog or a pig or a cat or a bear at every fresh question that was put to him this nephew burst into a fresh roar of laughter and was so inexpressibly tickled that he was obliged to get up off the sofa and stamp at last the plump sister falling into a similar state cried out ,A Christmas Carol
which it certainly was admiration was the universal sentiment though some objected that the reply to is it a bear ought to have been yes inasmuch as an answer in the negative was sufficient to have diverted their thoughts from mr scrooge supposing they had ever had any tendency that way ,A Christmas Carol
he has given us plenty of merriment i am sure said fred and it would be ungrateful not to drink his health here is a glass of mulled wine ready to our hand at the moment and i say uncle scrooge ,A Christmas Carol
a merry christmas and a happy new year to the old man whatever he is said scrooges nephew he wouldnt take it from me but may he have it nevertheless uncle scrooge ,A Christmas Carol
uncle scrooge had imperceptibly become so gay and light of heart that he would have pledged the unconscious company in return and thanked them in an inaudible speech if the ghost had given him time but the whole scene passed off in the breath of the last word spoken by his nephew and he and the spirit were again upon their travels ,A Christmas Carol
much they saw and far they went and many homes they visited but always with a happy end the spirit stood beside sick beds and they were cheerful on foreign lands and they were close at home by struggling men and they were patient in their greater hope by poverty and it was rich in almshouse hospital and jail in miserys every refuge where vain man in his little brief authority had not made fast the door and barred the spirit out he left his blessing and taught scrooge his precepts ,A Christmas Carol
it was a long night if it were only a night but scrooge had his doubts of this because the christmas holidays appeared to be condensed into the space of time they passed together it was strange too that while scrooge remained unaltered in his outward form the ghost grew older clearly older scrooge had observed this change but never spoke of it until they left a childrens twelfth night party when looking at the spirit as they stood together in an open place he noticed that its hair was grey ,A Christmas Carol
forgive me if i am not justified in what i ask said scrooge looking intently at the spirits robe but i see something strange and not belonging to yourself protruding from your skirts is it a foot or a claw ,A Christmas Carol
they were a boy and girl yellow meagre ragged scowling wolfish but prostrate too in their humility where graceful youth should have filled their features out and touched them with its freshest tints a stale and shrivelled hand like that of age had pinched and twisted them and pulled them into shreds where angels might have sat enthroned devils lurked and glared out menacing no change no degradation no perversion of humanity in any grade through all the mysteries of wonderful creation has monsters half so horrible and dread ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge started back appalled having them shown to him in this way he tried to say they were fine children but the words choked themselves rather than be parties to a lie of such enormous magnitude ,A Christmas Carol
they are mans said the spirit looking down upon them and they cling to me appealing from their fathers this boy is ignorance this girl is want beware them both and all of their degree but most of all beware this boy for on his brow i see that written which is doom unless the writing be erased deny it cried the spirit stretching out its hand towards the city slander those who tell it ye admit it for your factious purposes and make it worse and bide the end ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge looked about him for the ghost and saw it not as the last stroke ceased to vibrate he remembered the prediction of old jacob marley and lifting up his eyes beheld a solemn phantom draped and hooded coming like a mist along the ground towards him ,A Christmas Carol
the phantom slowly gravely silently approached when it came near him scrooge bent down upon his knee for in the very air through which this spirit moved it seemed to scatter gloom and mystery ,A Christmas Carol
it was shrouded in a deep black garment which concealed its head its face its form and left nothing of it visible save one outstretched hand but for this it would have been difficult to detach its figure from the night and separate it from the darkness by which it was surrounded ,A Christmas Carol
he felt that it was tall and stately when it came beside him and that its mysterious presence filled him with a solemn dread he knew no more for the spirit neither spoke nor moved ,A Christmas Carol
although well used to ghostly company by this time scrooge feared the silent shape so much that his legs trembled beneath him and he found that he could hardly stand when he prepared to follow it the spirit paused a moment as observing his condition and giving him time to recover ,A Christmas Carol
but scrooge was all the worse for this it thrilled him with a vague uncertain horror to know that behind the dusky shroud there were ghostly eyes intently fixed upon him while he though he stretched his own to the utmost could see nothing but a spectral hand and one great heap of black ,A Christmas Carol
ghost of the future he exclaimed i fear you more than any spectre i have seen but as i know your purpose is to do me good and as i hope to live to be another man from what i was i am prepared to bear you company and do it with a thankful heart will you not speak to me ,A Christmas Carol
they scarcely seemed to enter the city for the city rather seemed to spring up about them and encompass them of its own act but there they were in the heart of it on change amongst the merchants who hurried up and down and chinked the money in their pockets and conversed in groups and looked at their watches and trifled thoughtfully with their great gold seals and so forth as scrooge had seen them often ,A Christmas Carol
well i am the most disinterested among you after all said the first speaker for i never wear black gloves and i never eat lunch but ill offer to go if anybody else will when i come to think of it im not at all sure that i wasnt his most particular friend for we used to stop and speak whenever we met bye bye ,A Christmas Carol
he knew these men also perfectly they were men of business very wealthy and of great importance he had made a point always of standing well in their esteem in a business point of view that is strictly in a business point of view ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge was at first inclined to be surprised that the spirit should attach importance to conversations apparently so trivial but feeling assured that they must have some hidden purpose he set himself to consider what it was likely to be they could scarcely be supposed to have any bearing on the death of jacob his old partner for that was past and this ghosts province was the future nor could he think of any one immediately connected with himself to whom he could apply them but nothing doubting that to whomsoever they applied they had some latent moral for his own improvement he resolved to treasure up every word he heard and everything he saw and especially to observe the shadow of himself when it appeared for he had an expectation that the conduct of his future self would give him the clue he missed and would render the solution of these riddles easy ,A Christmas Carol
he looked about in that very place for his own image but another man stood in his accustomed corner and though the clock pointed to his usual time of day for being there he saw no likeness of himself among the multitudes that poured in through the porch it gave him little surprise however for he had been revolving in his mind a change of life and thought and hoped he saw his newborn resolutions carried out in this ,A Christmas Carol
quiet and dark beside him stood the phantom with its outstretched hand when he roused himself from his thoughtful quest he fancied from the turn of the hand and its situation in reference to himself that the unseen eyes were looking at him keenly it made him shudder and feel very cold ,A Christmas Carol
they left the busy scene and went into an obscure part of the town where scrooge had never penetrated before although he recognised its situation and its bad repute the ways were foul and narrow the shops and houses wretched the people halfnaked drunken slipshod ugly alleys and archways like so many cesspools disgorged their offences of smell and dirt and life upon the straggling streets and the whole quarter reeked with crime with filth and misery ,A Christmas Carol
far in this den of infamous resort there was a lowbrowed beetling shop below a penthouse roof where iron old rags bottles bones and greasy offal were bought upon the floor within were piled up heaps of rusty keys nails chains hinges files scales weights and refuse iron of all kinds secrets that few would like to scrutinise were bred and hidden in mountains of unseemly rags masses of corrupted fat and sepulchres of bones sitting in among the wares he dealt in by a charcoal stove made of old bricks was a greyhaired rascal nearly seventy years of age who had screened himself from the cold air without by a frousy curtaining of miscellaneous tatters hung upon a line and smoked his pipe in all the luxury of calm retirement ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge and the phantom came into the presence of this man just as a woman with a heavy bundle slunk into the shop but she had scarcely entered when another woman similarly laden came in too and she was closely followed by a man in faded black who was no less startled by the sight of them than they had been upon the recognition of each other after a short period of blank astonishment in which the old man with the pipe had joined them they all three burst into a laugh ,A Christmas Carol
let the charwoman alone to be the first cried she who had entered first let the laundress alone to be the second and let the undertakers man alone to be the third look here old joe heres a chance if we havent all three met here without meaning it ,A Christmas Carol
you couldnt have met in a better place said old joe removing his pipe from his mouth come into the parlour you were made free of it long ago you know and the other two ant strangers stop till i shut the door of the shop ah how it skreeks there ant such a rusty bit of metal in the place as its own hinges i believe and im sure theres no such old bones here as mine ha ha were all suitable to our calling were well matched come into the parlour come into the parlour ,A Christmas Carol
the parlour was the space behind the screen of rags the old man raked the fire together with an old stairrod and having trimmed his smoky lamp for it was night with the stem of his pipe put it in his mouth again ,A Christmas Carol
while he did this the woman who had already spoken threw her bundle on the floor and sat down in a flaunting manner on a stool crossing her elbows on her knees and looking with a bold defiance at the other two ,A Christmas Carol
if he wanted to keep em after he was dead a wicked old screw pursued the woman why wasnt he natural in his lifetime if he had been hed have had somebody to look after him when he was struck with death instead of lying gasping out his last there alone by himself ,A Christmas Carol
i wish it was a little heavier judgment replied the woman and it should have been you may depend upon it if i could have laid my hands on anything else open that bundle old joe and let me know the value of it speak out plain im not afraid to be the first nor afraid for them to see it we know pretty well that we were helping ourselves before we met here i believe its no sin open the bundle joe ,A Christmas Carol
but the gallantry of her friends would not allow of this and the man in faded black mounting the breach first produced his plunder it was not extensive a seal or two a pencilcase a pair of sleevebuttons and a brooch of no great value were all they were severally examined and appraised by old joe who chalked the sums he was disposed to give for each upon the wall and added them up into a total when he found there was nothing more to come ,A Christmas Carol
mrs dilber was next sheets and towels a little wearing apparel two oldfashioned silver teaspoons a pair of sugartongs and a few boots her account was stated on the wall in the same manner ,A Christmas Carol
i always give too much to ladies its a weakness of mine and thats the way i ruin myself said old joe thats your account if you asked me for another penny and made it an open question id repent of being so liberal and knock off halfacrown ,A Christmas Carol
i certainly shant hold my hand when i can get anything in it by reaching it out for the sake of such a man as he was i promise you joe returned the woman coolly dont drop that oil upon the blankets now ,A Christmas Carol
dont you be afraid of that returned the woman i ant so fond of his company that id loiter about him for such things if he did ah you may look through that shirt till your eyes ache but you wont find a hole in it nor a threadbare place its the best he had and a fine one too theyd have wasted it if it hadnt been for me ,A Christmas Carol
putting it on him to be buried in to be sure replied the woman with a laugh somebody was fool enough to do it but i took it off again if calico ant good enough for such a purpose it isnt good enough for anything its quite as becoming to the body he cant look uglier than he did in that one ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge listened to this dialogue in horror as they sat grouped about their spoil in the scanty light afforded by the old mans lamp he viewed them with a detestation and disgust which could hardly have been greater though they had been obscene demons marketing the corpse itself ,A Christmas Carol
ha ha laughed the same woman when old joe producing a flannel bag with money in it told out their several gains upon the ground this is the end of it you see he frightened every one away from him when he was alive to profit us when he was dead ha ha ha ,A Christmas Carol
spirit said scrooge shuddering from head to foot i see i see the case of this unhappy man might be my own my life tends that way now merciful heaven what is this ,A Christmas Carol
he recoiled in terror for the scene had changed and now he almost touched a bed a bare uncurtained bed on which beneath a ragged sheet there lay a something covered up which though it was dumb announced itself in awful language ,A Christmas Carol
the room was very dark too dark to be observed with any accuracy though scrooge glanced round it in obedience to a secret impulse anxious to know what kind of room it was a pale light rising in the outer air fell straight upon the bed and on it plundered and bereft unwatched unwept uncared for was the body of this man ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge glanced towards the phantom its steady hand was pointed to the head the cover was so carelessly adjusted that the slightest raising of it the motion of a finger upon scrooges part would have disclosed the face he thought of it felt how easy it would be to do and longed to do it but had no more power to withdraw the veil than to dismiss the spectre at his side ,A Christmas Carol
oh cold cold rigid dreadful death set up thine altar here and dress it with such terrors as thou hast at thy command for this is thy dominion but of the loved revered and honoured head thou canst not turn one hair to thy dread purposes or make one feature odious it is not that the hand is heavy and will fall down when released it is not that the heart and pulse are still but that the hand was open generous and true the heart brave warm and tender and the pulse a mans strike shadow strike and see his good deeds springing from the wound to sow the world with life immortal ,A Christmas Carol
no voice pronounced these words in scrooges ears and yet he heard them when he looked upon the bed he thought if this man could be raised up now what would be his foremost thoughts avarice harddealing griping cares they have brought him to a rich end truly ,A Christmas Carol
he lay in the dark empty house with not a man a woman or a child to say that he was kind to me in this or that and for the memory of one kind word i will be kind to him a cat was tearing at the door and there was a sound of gnawing rats beneath the hearthstone what they wanted in the room of death and why they were so restless and disturbed scrooge did not dare to think ,A Christmas Carol
she was expecting some one and with anxious eagerness for she walked up and down the room started at every sound looked out from the window glanced at the clock tried but in vain to work with her needle and could hardly bear the voices of the children in their play ,A Christmas Carol
at length the longexpected knock was heard she hurried to the door and met her husband a man whose face was careworn and depressed though he was young there was a remarkable expression in it now a kind of serious delight of which he felt ashamed and which he struggled to repress ,A Christmas Carol
he sat down to the dinner that had been hoarding for him by the fire and when she asked him faintly what news which was not until after a long silence he appeared embarrassed how to answer ,A Christmas Carol
she was a mild and patient creature if her face spoke truth but she was thankful in her soul to hear it and she said so with clasped hands she prayed forgiveness the next moment and was sorry but the first was the emotion of her heart ,A Christmas Carol
what the halfdrunken woman whom i told you of last night said to me when i tried to see him and obtain a weeks delay and what i thought was a mere excuse to avoid me turns out to have been quite true he was not only very ill but dying then ,A Christmas Carol
i dont know but before that time we shall be ready with the money and even though we were not it would be a bad fortune indeed to find so merciless a creditor in his successor we may sleep tonight with light hearts caroline ,A Christmas Carol
yes soften it as they would their hearts were lighter the childrens faces hushed and clustered round to hear what they so little understood were brighter and it was a happier house for this mans death the only emotion that the ghost could show him caused by the event was one of pleasure ,A Christmas Carol
the ghost conducted him through several streets familiar to his feet and as they went along scrooge looked here and there to find himself but nowhere was he to be seen they entered poor bob cratchits house the dwelling he had visited before and found the mother and the children seated round the fire ,A Christmas Carol
quiet very quiet the noisy little cratchits were as still as statues in one corner and sat looking up at peter who had a book before him the mother and her daughters were engaged in sewing but surely they were very quiet ,A Christmas Carol
where had scrooge heard those words he had not dreamed them the boy must have read them out as he and the spirit crossed the threshold why did he not go on ,A Christmas Carol
theyre better now again said cratchits wife it makes them weak by candlelight and i wouldnt show weak eyes to your father when he comes home for the world it must be near his time ,A Christmas Carol
she hurried out to meet him and little bob in his comforter he had need of it poor fellowcame in his tea was ready for him on the hob and they all tried who should help him to it most then the two young cratchits got upon his knees and laid each child a little cheek against his face as if they said dont mind it father dont be grieved ,A Christmas Carol
bob was very cheerful with them and spoke pleasantly to all the family he looked at the work upon the table and praised the industry and speed of mrs cratchit and the girls they would be done long before sunday he said ,A Christmas Carol
yes my dear returned bob i wish you could have gone it would have done you good to see how green a place it is but youll see it often i promised him that i would walk there on a sunday my little little child cried bob my little child ,A Christmas Carol
he left the room and went upstairs into the room above which was lighted cheerfully and hung with christmas there was a chair set close beside the child and there were signs of some one having been there lately poor bob sat down in it and when he had thought a little and composed himself he kissed the little face he was reconciled to what had happened and went down again quite happy ,A Christmas Carol
they drew about the fire and talked the girls and mother working still bob told them of the extraordinary kindness of mr scrooges nephew whom he had scarcely seen but once and who meeting him in the street that day and seeing that he looked a littlejust a little down you know said bob inquired what had happened to distress him on which said bob for he is the pleasantestspoken gentleman you ever heard i told him i am heartily sorry for it mr cratchit he said and heartily sorry for your good wife by the bye how he ever knew that i dont know ,A Christmas Carol
very well observed my boy cried bob i hope they do heartily sorry he said for your good wife if i can be of service to you in any way he said giving me his card thats where i live pray come to me now it wasnt cried bob for the sake of anything he might be able to do for us so much as for his kind way that this was quite delightful it really seemed as if he had known our tiny tim and felt with us ,A Christmas Carol
its just as likely as not said bob one of these days though theres plenty of time for that my dear but however and whenever we part from one another i am sure we shall none of us forget poor tiny timshall weor this first parting that there was among us ,A Christmas Carol
and i know said bob i know my dears that when we recollect how patient and how mild he was although he was a little little child we shall not quarrel easily among ourselves and forget poor tiny tim in doing it ,A Christmas Carol
mrs cratchit kissed him his daughters kissed him the two young cratchits kissed him and peter and himself shook hands spirit of tiny tim thy childish essence was from god ,A Christmas Carol
the ghost of christmas yet to come conveyed him as beforethough at a different time he thought indeed there seemed no order in these latter visions save that they were in the futureinto the resorts of business men but showed him not himself indeed the spirit did not stay for anything but went straight on as to the end just now desired until besought by scrooge to tarry for a moment ,A Christmas Carol
this court said scrooge through which we hurry now is where my place of occupation is and has been for a length of time i see the house let me behold what i shall be in days to come ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge hastened to the window of his office and looked in it was an office still but not his the furniture was not the same and the figure in the chair was not himself the phantom pointed as before ,A Christmas Carol
a churchyard here then the wretched man whose name he had now to learn lay underneath the ground it was a worthy place walled in by houses overrun by grass and weeds the growth of vegetations death not life choked up with too much burying fat with repleted appetite a worthy place ,A Christmas Carol
the spirit stood among the graves and pointed down to one he advanced towards it trembling the phantom was exactly as it had been but he dreaded that he saw new meaning in its solemn shape ,A Christmas Carol
before i draw nearer to that stone to which you point said scrooge answer me one question are these the shadows of the things that will be or are they shadows of things that may be only ,A Christmas Carol
mens courses will foreshadow certain ends to which if persevered in they must lead said scrooge but if the courses be departed from the ends will change say it is thus with what you show me ,A Christmas Carol
spirit he cried tight clutching at its robe hear me i am not the man i was i will not be the man i must have been but for this intercourse why show me this if i am past all hope ,A Christmas Carol
good spirit he pursued as down upon the ground he fell before it your nature intercedes for me and pities me assure me that i yet may change these shadows you have shown me by an altered life ,A Christmas Carol
i will honour christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year i will live in the past the present and the future the spirits of all three shall strive within me i will not shut out the lessons that they teach oh tell me i may sponge away the writing on this stone ,A Christmas Carol
i will live in the past the present and the future scrooge repeated as he scrambled out of bed the spirits of all three shall strive within me oh jacob marley heaven and the christmas time be praised for this i say it on my knees old jacob on my knees ,A Christmas Carol
he was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions that his broken voice would scarcely answer to his call he had been sobbing violently in his conflict with the spirit and his face was wet with tears ,A Christmas Carol
they are not torn down cried scrooge folding one of his bedcurtains in his arms they are not torn down rings and all they are herei am herethe shadows of the things that would have been may be dispelled they will be i know they will ,A Christmas Carol
his hands were busy with his garments all this time turning them inside out putting them on upside down tearing them mislaying them making them parties to every kind of extravagance ,A Christmas Carol
i dont know what to do cried scrooge laughing and crying in the same breath and making a perfect laocon of himself with his stockings i am as light as a feather i am as happy as an angel i am as merry as a schoolboy i am as giddy as a drunken man a merry christmas to everybody a happy new year to all the world hallo here whoop hallo ,A Christmas Carol

i dont know what day of the month it is said scrooge i dont know how long ive been among the spirits i dont know anything im quite a baby never mind i dont care id rather be a baby hallo whoop hallo here ,A Christmas Carol
he was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the lustiest peals he had ever heard clash clang hammer ding dong bell bell dong ding hammer clang clash oh glorious glorious ,A Christmas Carol
running to the window he opened it and put out his head no fog no mist clear bright jovial stirring cold cold piping for the blood to dance to golden sunlight heavenly sky sweet fresh air merry bells oh glorious glorious ,A Christmas Carol
its christmas day said scrooge to himself i havent missed it the spirits have done it all in one night they can do anything they like of course they can of course they can hallo my fine fellow ,A Christmas Carol

no no said scrooge i am in earnest go and buy it and tell em to bring it here that i may give them the direction where to take it come back with the man and ill give you a shilling come back with him in less than five minutes and ill give you halfacrown ,A Christmas Carol
ill send it to bob cratchits whispered scrooge rubbing his hands and splitting with a laugh he shant know who sends it its twice the size of tiny tim joe miller never made such a joke as sending it to bobs will be ,A Christmas Carol
the hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one but write it he did somehow and went downstairs to open the street door ready for the coming of the poulterers man as he stood there waiting his arrival the knocker caught his eye ,A Christmas Carol
i shall love it as long as i live cried scrooge patting it with his hand i scarcely ever looked at it before what an honest expression it has in its face its a wonderful knockerheres the turkey hallo whoop how are you merry christmas ,A Christmas Carol
the chuckle with which he said this and the chuckle with which he paid for the turkey and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab and the chuckle with which he recompensed the boy were only to be exceeded by the chuckle with which he sat down breathless in his chair again and chuckled till he cried ,A Christmas Carol
shaving was not an easy task for his hand continued to shake very much and shaving requires attention even when you dont dance while you are at it but if he had cut the end of his nose off he would have put a piece of stickingplaister over it and been quite satisfied ,A Christmas Carol
he dressed himself all in his best and at last got out into the streets the people were by this time pouring forth as he had seen them with the ghost of christmas present and walking with his hands behind him scrooge regarded every one with a delighted smile he looked so irresistibly pleasant in a word that three or four goodhumoured fellows said good morning sir a merry christmas to you and scrooge said often afterwards that of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard those were the blithest in his ears ,A Christmas Carol
he had not gone far when coming on towards him he beheld the portly gentleman who had walked into his countinghouse the day before and said scrooge and marleys i believe  it sent a pang across his heart to think how this old gentleman would look upon him when they met but he knew what path lay straight before him and he took it ,A Christmas Carol
my dear sir said scrooge quickening his pace and taking the old gentleman by both his hands how do you do i hope you succeeded yesterday it was very kind of you a merry christmas to you sir ,A Christmas Carol
yes said scrooge that is my name and i fear it may not be pleasant to you allow me to ask your pardon and will you have the goodnesshere scrooge whispered in his ear ,A Christmas Carol
he went to church and walked about the streets and watched the people hurrying to and fro and patted children on the head and questioned beggars and looked down into the kitchens of houses and up to the windows and found that everything could yield him pleasure he had never dreamed that any walkthat anythingcould give him so much happiness in the afternoon he turned his steps towards his nephews house ,A Christmas Carol
he turned it gently and sidled his face in round the door they were looking at the table which was spread out in great array for these young housekeepers are always nervous on such points and like to see that everything is right ,A Christmas Carol
dear heart alive how his niece by marriage started scrooge had forgotten for the moment about her sitting in the corner with the footstool or he wouldnt have done it on any account ,A Christmas Carol
let him in it is a mercy he didnt shake his arm off he was at home in five minutes nothing could be heartier his niece looked just the same so did topper when he came so did the plump sister when she came so did every one when they came wonderful party wonderful games wonderful unanimity wonderful happiness ,A Christmas Carol
but he was early at the office next morning oh he was early there if he could only be there first and catch bob cratchit coming late that was the thing he had set his heart upon ,A Christmas Carol
and he did it yes he did the clock struck nine no bob a quarter past no bob he was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time scrooge sat with his door wide open that he might see him come into the tank ,A Christmas Carol
now ill tell you what my friend said scrooge i am not going to stand this sort of thing any longer and therefore he continued leaping from his stool and giving bob such a dig in the waistcoat that he staggered back into the tank again and therefore i am about to raise your salary ,A Christmas Carol
bob trembled and got a little nearer to the ruler he had a momentary idea of knocking scrooge down with it holding him and calling to the people in the court for help and a straitwaistcoat ,A Christmas Carol
a merry christmas bob said scrooge with an earnestness that could not be mistaken as he clapped him on the back a merrier christmas bob my good fellow than i have given you for many a year ill raise your salary and endeavour to assist your struggling family and we will discuss your affairs this very afternoon over a christmas bowl of smoking bishop bob make up the fires and buy another coalscuttle before you dot another i bob cratchit ,A Christmas Carol
scrooge was better than his word he did it all and infinitely more and to tiny tim who did not die he was a second father he became as good a friend as good a master and as good a man as the good old city knew or any other good old city town or borough in the good old world some people laughed to see the alteration in him but he let them laugh and little heeded them for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe for good at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the outset and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins as have the malady in less attractive forms his own heart laughed and that was quite enough for him ,A Christmas Carol
he had no further intercourse with spirits but lived upon the total abstinence principle ever afterwards and it was always said of him that he knew how to keep christmas well if any man alive possessed the knowledge may that be truly said of us and all of us and so as tiny tim observed god bless us every one ,A Christmas Carol
